There, he and the cutlers union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldiers Knife and in 1897 with the Officers Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as inoxydable" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.<br> <br> Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland. <br> <br> <b>Care Tips for Swiss Army Knives</b><br> The various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.<br> <br> <b>Sharpening</b><br> To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15 20. This will result in a cutting angle of 30 40. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.<br> <br> <b>Cleaning</b><br> After youve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher."

Red bronze contains almost 85-percent copper. This additional copper content gives the bronze alloy its rich, reddish undertone. The mirrored finish of polished brass and polished bronze is achieved through varying degrees of sanding and buffing. Michael uses these techniques to highlight or accent the raised areas on a piece. The Pineapple is a traditional symbol of abundant hospitality, making it an ideal image for your home's front door."	1

GE incandescent lamps represents the state of the art of lamps for residential and commercial use, as well as special purpose lamps for decorative or display applications. In an incandescent lamp, light is generated by heating the filament to incandescence. The hotter the filament, the more efficient it is in converting electricity to light. However, when the filament operates hotter, its life is shortened so the design of each lamp is a balance between efficiency and life.

The SL-5411-GR features 150-degree motion detection at up to 70 feet with a metal housing for durability, and it uses two PAR38 flood bulbs (120-watt, not included). This model comes in gray, but it's also available in white. Studies show that light is the #1 deterrent to crime, and Heath Zenith's intelligent motion lighting fixtures help give the appearance of a startled homeowner turning on the lights to investigate what's going on outside. They also provide convenient illumination when you need it most, whether you're working outside at night or needing to see the steps more clearly to avoid a fall. Lights are activated when motion is detected, so there's no need to waste electricity by leaving the lights on all night. You can choose between three auto modes&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;1, 5, or 10 minutes of illumination after motion triggers the light. However, when constant light is needed, this motion-activated light has a manual override mode that allows it to function as switch-controlled light for constant on, dusk-to-dawn lighting. Heath Zenith uses superior pulse-count motion detection technology, which prevents false triggering by reading heat and movement in pulses as opposed to single occurrences. As a result, only substantial motion is detected, such as humans and animals. In addition to being Energy Star certified, this model meets California's Title-24 energy efficiency standards for residential and commercial buildings. SL-5411 security light with installation hardware and instructions Originating from the Heath Company, Heath Zenith has been focusing on intelligent lighting, door chimes, and wireless lighting controls since the 1980s.

Like all Leeks, the olive version features a 3-inch Sandvik stainless steel blade with a razor-sharp edge, highlighting excellent edge retention, corrosion resistance and toughness. The modified drop-point blade, bead-blasted for stylish good looks to help hide scratches, makes it an ideal-shaped knife for slicing, while the slim tip makes piercing and detail work easy. The handle, made of 6061-T6 anodized aluminum and bonded with an olive drab dye, is resistant wear, corrosion and fading. SpeedSafe assisted opening offers smooth one-handed blade operation using the flipper or thumbstud. The Leeks secure locking liner prevents accidental blade closure during use and a sliding tip-lock keeps the blade safely in the handle during transport. The pocketclip is reversible for tip-up or tip-down carry and the handle is pre-drilled for lanyard attachment. There are lots of very good reasons the Leek is one of the most popular Kershaw's. For one thing, the slim blade is remarkably versatile. This modified drop-point blade shape gives it good slicing capabilities, while the slim tip lets it excel at piercing and detail work. The blade steel is high-performance Sandvik 14C28N stainless that sharpens to a razor edge and holds the edge for a good long time. The 3-inch blade is perfect for most day-to-day tasks. Leek lovers also love the fast and easy opening provided by Speed Safe assisted opening. Whether you're left-handed or right-handed, a simple pull back on the ambidextrous flipper or push outward on the thumb stud and the Leeks blade is ready to go to work. But the newest and most obvious thing about this Leek is the olive drab handle color. The color is eye-catching and different, but also discrete. The olive drab color is fade-resistant, scratch-resistant and permanently bonded to the anodized aluminumso it looks good now and looks good later, too. For safety, a locking liner keeps the blade locked open during use and a Tip-Lock slider locks it closed when folded. The pocket clip is reversible for tip-up or tip-down carry and the handle is drilled to accept a lanyard. This slim, easy-to-carry design, with plenty of cutting versatility just may be the perfect EDC. Made In The USA, Flipper, Speed Safe, Liner Lock, Reversible."	1

Individual springs hold the tools in place so you can easily access each one individually from the outside of the handle. The lock and release system is designed to lock each tool in place when opened, and release to fold away with a simple slide of the release button. The SwissTool is truly a handyperson's helper with a multitude of implements and available accessories; it's at your service when it's at your side. From lightweight design to its outside opening implements, there's not much the SwissTool can't do.&nbsp;<br /><br />Like all Swiss Army Knives, the SwissTool has a lifetime warranty, stainless steel implements and Swiss-made quality and durability. <br /><br />Includes 38 Functions: <strong>History and Heritage</strong><br />In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers&rsquo; union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier&rsquo;s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer&rsquo;s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as &ldquo;inoxydable" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.<br /><br />Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland. <br /><br /><strong>Care Tips for Swiss Army Knives</strong><br />The various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.<br /><br /><strong>Sharpening</strong><br />To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15&deg;&ndash; 20&deg;. This will result in a cutting angle of 30&deg;&ndash; 40&deg;. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.<br /><br /><strong>Cleaning</strong><br />After you&rsquo;ve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher."
