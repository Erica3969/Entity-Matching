The roots of the company can be found in Oates' entrepreneurial spirit. He and his brother used to farm the mountain areas of Bat Cave in western North Carolina. They would also help their mother find materials for her crafts. The sons began to make wooden whistles, buckets and bird-houses. They would sell their wares along with her crafts to the people from Charlotte that came through in their horse-drawn buggies on the way to the mountains. Later, Thomas worked at the Ashville Postcard Company. When the Depression hit, he lost his job, but it inspired him to go into business and sell crafts, like cornhusk dolls and woven pieces, that were produced by the local women. He had learned about the wholesale business while working at Ashville. He built a waterwheel to generate electricity at a mill, began making product and opened shop. Over the years, he expanded the company. His son, Lemuel Oates, who would next manage the company, says he worked in the business from a young age. He explains the products were made from cotton scraps left over from making socks. Half-inch circles would be looped together to form a variety of products. Lemuel Oates went to college and then settled in Richmond. In December 1973, he returned to Bat Cave and took over the company. In 2007 his son Travis and his daughter, Molly Oates Sherrill, took over the business."	1

With the convenience of the CobraCo Hose Holder, putting your hose away becomes a less frustrating task. The holder has a molded center post inside that allows you to quickly and neatly coil your garden hose. And it's just as easy to uncoil the hose when you need to use it again. <b>Protects Your Hose for Longer Life</b><br>Tangles and kinks are both inconvenient and can also shorten the life of your hose. The smooth coiling and uncoiling made possible by the CobraCo Hose Holder helps give your hose a longer life. Because garden hoses can leak leftover water from their spout when they're coiled, the holder features small holes drilled in the bottom to allow drainage. Keeping the pot dry extends the life of the container. And, by keeping the hose dry, it's less likely to deteriorate. <b>What's in the Box</b><br>Hose holder. <br clear="all">"	1

From small to large rooms, this heater is effective. Includes a LCD room temperature display. This Black & Decker heater fan also includes a series of safety features. Foremost is the exclusive Fireshield. This component is an ACLI power cord that not only turns the heater off if a shock hazard exists, but also turns the heater off if the line cord is damaged. The unit will also shut itself off when the unit is picked up or if it loses contact with the surface on which it is operating. In addition, it also features the added safety of auto shut off if the heater unit overheats. For convenience, this unit includes a frost watch thermostat - it can be set so that if room temperature drops below approximately 40 degrees, the heater will turn on to heat the room and prevent frost damage. Additional conveniences include a soft touch handle with cool touch housing and a fan only setting so it can be used year round. With eight safety features and a "frost watch" setting that prevents frozen water pipes by turning on automatically if the temperature drops below 40 degrees F, this compact, lightweight, 1500- watt heater has a mind of its own when it comes to security. Measuring just 11 inches high, 6-1/2 inches wide, and 10-3/4 inches deep, the heater is readily portable, with a soft-grip handle and a cool-touch housing to ensure comfort. Other safety features include a fire shield to prevent an electrical fire by shutting off the heater if the power cord is damaged. The unit also shuts off if it overheats (a caution light warns if this occurs), if it tips or falls over, or if it is lifted. Suitable for floor, tabletop, shelf, or desk, the heater rests on big feet for stability. A digital thermometer, operating on LR44 batteries (included) with an approximate 1-year life, displays a room's temperature even when the heater is not plugged in. A fan-only setting circulates cool air in warm seasons, three settings adjust for room size, and a temperature control sets the heat level as desired. <I>-- Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Iittala Ultima Thule Double Old-Fashioned Glasses(On The Rocks) , Set of 2" COL feature VAL "Set of 2 Ultima Thule 9-1/2-ounce double old-fashioned glasses Clear glass crafted in wooden molds for an organic look Textured bubble effect on slightly curved vessels Glassware collection designed by Tapio Wirkkala in 1968 Dishwasher-safe; made in Finland" COL description VAL "A moment frozen in time.

By 1969, Partch had designed 27 new instruments made to be beautiful in sound, vision, and magical purpose. They were tuned according to the natural overtone series of just intonation. Partch designed his instruments to involve the whole person in the art of music. The melodious sounds of the Chimes of Partch will bring this magic to your yard or garden. <BR><BR>Woodstock Chimes are the original, musically-tuned, high-quality windchimes known worldwide for their superior sound. When listening to a Woodstock Chime, you hear a fine musical instrument played by the wind, perfectly hand-tuned using the ancient system of just intonation based on natural harmonics. This means the frequencies at which the different tubes vibrate are related to one another by simple whole-number ratios. Tones that are related in this way produce the most beautiful musical intervals. The sonic effect is exceptionally pure and soothing.<BR><BR>More than 30 years ago, the first Woodstock Chime was created by founder and owner Garry Kvistad from an aluminum lawn chair he found in a landfill. As a professional musician and instrument designer, he was fascinated by the Scales of Olympos, a 7th century pentatonic scale that cant be played on a modern piano. Garry had the idea to cut and tune the lawn chair tubes to the exact frequency of the ancient scale. The resulting Chimes of Olympos was the first Woodstock Chime and is still one of our bestselling windchimes. Garry and his wife Diane founded Woodstock Percussion, Inc. in 1979 and it remains a family-owned business in New Yorks Hudson Valley."

The Makita Big Bore engineered pump with cast iron cylinder has greater bore and stroke for increased compression, faster recovery and less noise. The cast iron construction is engineered for increased durability even under tough job site conditions. The MAC700 has an oil-lubricated pump and is equipped with a large automotive style filter for increased air intake and greater efficiency. The Big Bore oil-lubricated pump is also more efficient: the MAC700 runs cooler and at half the RPM of most competitive units, resulting in greater motor and pump life and lower noise. The 2.6-gallon tank sustains an operating pressure of 130 PSI, and delivers 40PSI (3.8 CFM) and 90 PSI (3.3 CFM). The low AMP draw reduces instances of tripped breakers and voltage drop that can cause premature motor failure. The roll bar handle provides portability and additional protection, helping it withstand harsh jobsite environments. Additional features include a convenient oil drain and oil sight glass, a tank drain valve that supersedes standard petcock design for easier maintenance, and finned discharge tubing that dissipates heat more efficiently. <b>Versatile Design for a Range of Applications</b><br>The MAC700 is engineered for low noise, high output and less maintenance, and delivers industrial power and results with improved durability under tough job site conditions. The MAC700 is just another example of Makita's commitment to innovative technology and best-in-class engineering. <b>About Makita Big Bore Air Compressors</b><br><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/content_26/Q2_2009/makita-bigbore-logo.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5">Makita Big Bore Air Compressors deliver higher output and less noise for improved job site performance.

This knife's broad serrations make decorative cuts easy. Good for garnishes and/or cruditEs. Fancy slicing of fruits and vegetables. The serrated 5-inch cutting edge and ergonomic handle make this a top-notch utility knife. Forged in Solingen, Germany, of a combination of ice-hardened carbon and stainless steel for edge retention, rust-resistance, and durability, this knife easily cuts through any food with a tough outer casing: sausages, tomatoes, eggplant, or crusty bread, for example. Most useful indeed! The ergonomic polypropylene handle lies comfortably in your hand, facilitating strain-free use; the metal bolster acts as a finger-guard; and the blade, bolster, and tang are fused into a single, seamless piece for easy handling and balance.. The absence of rivets and recesses in the synthetic handle allows for dishwasher use. Finally! Still, the best way to care for this knife is to hand wash it with a mild soap, rinse it well, and then immediately wipe it dry.<i> --Marcela Broussard </i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fivestar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> The TWIN Five Star range is a masterful blend of sharpness and ergonomic design.

The shape of the glass helps to release the aromas of the red wines, emphasize fruit and balance tannins. It is RIEDEL's uncomplicated entry level series for customers who appreciate good reasonable priced wine. All RIEDEL glasses are dishwasher safe. Perfect for everyday use, the four red-wine glasses in this set are part of the moderately priced Ouverture series offered by world-renowned Austrian wineglass maker Riedel Crystal (founded in 1756). Being lead-free, they're not crystal like Riedel's premium glasses but are machine blown of potash glass and are dishwasher-safe. Their thin rims are cut and polished to Riedel's exacting standards, so wine flows easily onto the tongue. Each glass holds 12-3/8 ounces and stands 7-3/8 inches high. Though glasses shaped and sized for different types of wine seem commonplace today, when Riedel introduced this idea in 1961, it was revolutionary. Since then Riedel has continued fine-tuning glasses to bring out the best characteristics in wines and spirits. Varying bowls' shapes and sizes affects the position of the head when sipping and where wine first contacts the tongue's various taste zones. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	0

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

Near perfect in design, the pan is constructed of three layers of metal; two stainless steel outer layers with an aluminum core. The stainless steel exterior combined with the aluminum core allows the pan to be used on all types of stovetops, including induction, and heats the pan evenly to eliminate hot spots. Additionally, the pan has a non-stick coating which makes food removal and clean-up a breeze. The classically sloped sides help prevent messes, and when you're finished cooking, the pan can be hung through the handle's eyelet for convenient storage. Producing some of the finest cookware in the nation, All-Clad has been featured in many high class and gourmet restaurants for its superior performance and aesthetically designed pieces crafted from American artists using the finest metals. A firm believer in quality over convenience, All-Clad's metals are formulated and bonded with cooking performance in mind, and are combined with stunning designs to provide you with the best cooking experience possible. The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the steel. This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's an imposing 14 inches in diameter (and 2 inches deep), which is large enough for a professional kitchen but fully functional in a home kitchen, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for healthful meals.

All-Clad Stainless cookware sandwiches a thick core of three separate layers of aluminum between an easy-to-clean, highly polished 18/10 stainless-steel cooking surface and a magnetic stainless-steel exterior. The aluminum core retains heat and evenly distributes it along the bottom and up the sidewalls of the cookware. The stainless interior is stick-resistant and cleans easily. The magnetic stainless-steel exterior gives the cookware a gleaming finish. All-Clad Stainless also features the companys signature "stay-cool" long handles, lids fashioned from gleaming 18/10 stainless steel, and highly durable stainless-steel rivets. All-Clad Stainless cookware is one of five collections from All-Clad Metalcrafters. Designed to work on conventional gas and electric ranges, as well as induction cooktops, All-Clad Stainless cookware is the best-selling collection in a full line that includes All-Clad LTD, Cop-R-Chef, Master Chef 2, and Copper Core. <b>Features and Benefits</b> <br> All-Clad pans with a stainless interior cooking surface are oven-safe up to 500 degrees. All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include: <ul> <li>Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer. <li>Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you wont have "hot spots" when cooking. <li>Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface. <li>Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles. <li>Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods. <li>Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pans edges to seal in flavor of your foods. <li>The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops. <li>The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface. </ul> <b>Warranty</b> <br> From date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keepers Friend. To use the Bar Keepers Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keepers Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keepers Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack. Both of these one-pot comfort food specialty pans comes with All-Clads popular high dome-shaped lid. Other specialty pans include a larger brasier pan with domed-shape lid; a complete family of round-shaped saucier saucepans for versatile stove-top cooking; a flare-sided Windsor pan in two sizes, designed for reduction and the creation of rich sauces; and a contemporary "Soup for Two" 3-1/2-quart soup pot; casseroles; an open stir fry; a versatile wok-style chefs pan; and a "Pasta Pentola" 7-quart stockpot with colander insert and lid. All saucepans, casseroles, saut pans, stock pots, and specialty items come with lids. Double boiler and steamer inserts, including the large steamer insert for 6-quart, 8-quart and 12-quart stockpots, are available as well. Stainless cookware sets are available in various sizes, from a starter 5-piece to a complete 10-piece set. <b>About All-Clad Metalcrafters</b> <br> Based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, All-Clad Metalcrafters markets premium quality cookware to department and specialty stores in the United States, along with premium All-Clad bonded bakeware, All-Clad All-Professional kitchen tools, and a growing assortment of kitchen accessories, including All-Clads upscale tea kettle, measuring scoop set, stainless-steel mixing bowls, kitchen colanders, and 1-cup measuring cup.

Their 5-inch random orbit sander is contoured and tapered to fit the human hand with remarkable precision. We were also won over by the many rubberized grips and the placement of the variable-speed dial, which sits right where your thumb naturally rests. (Anyone who's ever wrestled with an uncomfortable sander knows how frustrating bad design can be.) But ergonomics is not the only area in which Bosch excels. Their dual ball-bearing system is unique to the industry and makes for a smooth ride. The variable speed lets you match the speed to the task. Quick-change hook-and-loop paper is always a plus. Dust collection is great. There's also an auxiliary handle you can remove if you need to maneuver the sander in tight places. Finally, the sander's flawless, properly swirl-free results can be attributed to the precise eccentric/orbital motion of the tool.

The FatMax line of hand tools features core tools essential for the pro or expert enthusiast who desire high quality, durable tools. BladeArmor coating is a patented industrial thermoplastic coating, the very same material that has been used to strengthen and protect aircraft parts, such as the rotor blades on the Sikorsky Black Hawk Helicopter. Simply put, it helps aircraft survive war zones, and it also helps tape blades survive construction zones. Applying BladeArmor coating to tape blades reduces both tape breakage and tape returns, enabling it to conquer the toughest testing ground of all -- the job site! The Stanley Works, originally a bolt and door hardware manufacturing company located in New Britain, Connecticut; was founded in 1843 by Frederick T. Stanley. A few years later, in 1857, Fredericks cousin, Henry Stanley, founded The Stanley Rule and Level Company. In 1920, The Rule and Level Company merged with The Stanley Works and would go on to become its famous Hand Tools Division. Over the years, The Stanley Works has produced some of the most innovative and useful tools ever made. Among these tools are the Bailey Plane, the Surform shaper, the PowerLock tape rule and most recently the FatMax line of products. Today, more than ever, Stanley continues to be an industry leader in tool innovation. In 2001, Stanley introduced more than 100 new products, bringing to 400 the number of new products introduced in the past four years.

As a practicing veterinarian in the 1960's Dr Ted Lafeber Sr. was treating pet birds and soon realized that most pet birds were suffering from malnutrition. Birds can not survive on millet, canary seed and sunflower seeds alone. In 1975, he created the very first pet bird pellet recipe. Initially, many people thought he was crazy, birds eat seeds, not pellets, but then they saw the results the birds eating pellets were healthier, happier and living longer. Nutritionally Balanced Good health and a long life begin with proper nutrition and Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet is formulated to provide exactly that. Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet is a high quality blend of natural ingredients like ground non-GMO corn and soybean meal. Both grains are literally grown outside Lafeber Company's front door. We also add whole egg, the world's most digestive form of protein. The different grains are mixed and essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids are added which are necessary for strong bones and brilliant feathers. Watch your feathered friend shine with the excellent nutrition found in Lafeber' s pelleted bird food. Balancing the Omega Fatty Acids increases immune function. Generally, increased immune function helps the body's ability to fight disease. Balanced Omega 3 & 6's also improves the quality of the skin. More than ever, each pelleted recipe provides excellent nutrition for your loved feathered companion. Creating the first Omega 3 & 6 balanced pet bird pellet is just one of the reasons Lafeber Company is considered the leader in avian nutrition. Our veterinarians and nutritionist determined the best combination of natural preservatives, specifically mixed tocopherols and citric acid, to protect the nutrients of Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet pellets. Our pellets are naturally flavored with the great taste of molasses. Molasses provides the energy birds need and a taste birds enjoy."	0

In modern times, running has become a popular sport, recreation and fitness activity. The run to Athens in 490 BC by an ancient Greek military courier named Pheidippides from a battlefield near the town of Marathon to report the Greek victory over the Persians is the famous endurance run upon which the first modern Olympics, held in Athens in 1896, based its longest distance run. It is legend that Pheidippides shouted, "Victory!," as he entered Athens and then immediately died from exhaustion. Spiridon Louis, a postal worker, also from Greece, won the first modern marathon, finishing a full 7 minutes ahead of the other eight finishers (seven others of whom were also Greek). In addition to its importance as one of the most challenging and dramatic athletic events in each Olympic Games, the marathon run has become a popular event in many locations throughout the world every year, often resembling a "fitness festival," celebrating human determination, stamina and dominance over the environment in which it is run. Finishing a marathon, in whatever time, is "victory" enough for most of the persons who enter the race. The Boston Marathon was first run on April 19, 1897. It is held every year on Patriots Day, commemorating the April 19th midnight ride of Paul Revere to warn his fellow American colonists in and around Boston that the British were invading from the sea at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The Boston Marathon is the oldest continuous marathon event outside of the Olympics. The New York City Marathon, begun in 1976 and held in November, has become the largest marathon, with over thirty thousand entries. The Los Angeles Marathon, held in March, is the third largest, with more than twenty thousand participants.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

Henckels Professional &quot;S&quot;10-Inch Chef's Knife This is a classic French chef's knife, with a broad blade and curved cutting edge for rocking through a chopping task. Its 10-inch blade suits strong and/or big-handed cooks; those with smaller hands might prefer an 8- or 6-inch knife. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish Pro S from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Pro S handles are heavier and its knives less weight-forward. The steel used in the Pro S line is identical to that of the Five and Four Star lines. High-tech welding of larger knives combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel. While this chef's knife is dishwasher-safe, hand washing is recommended. <I>--Fred Brack</I> <P> <B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/henck-pro-s-block.jpg </td> <td> The J.A.

Sigmaforge one-piece construction also provides high precision and improved stability of the blade and steel structure, thus improving cutting-edge retention for lasting sharpness. In addition, Twin Pro S knives use J.A.

There's good balance, and the handles are a shade heavier than other lines, which some cooks will prefer. The 8-inch blade length is the most practical for multipurpose use, and regular sharpening will keep the stainless-steel blade razor-sharp. It's only minimally flexible, which makes it a great choice for vegetables such as potatoes and turnips.

COL title VAL "Granite Ware Stock Pot, 15.5-Quart" COL feature VAL "Constructed of low carbon steel with glass coating No PFOA's or any other chemical to alter food's taste Dark interior absorbs ovens energy Steel core evenly distributes the heat" COL description VAL "This 15.5 Qt covered stock pot is perfect for all your large cooking needs. It's constructed of dark porcelain surface and steel core absorb energy to heat rapidly. There are no PFOA's or other chemicals to alter food's taste, color or healthfulness. Porcelain is fused to the steel at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit producing a non-porous, inert glass surface that is naturally non-stick. Porcelain can chip if dropped, however this does not reduce the effectiveness of the cookware. It creates a smooth, hard finish that wont burn and resists staining. Its also non -porous so it wont trap odors or food particles and provides a low coefficient of friction  meaning that it cleans up easily and, it is corrosion and chemically resistant so it will last a long time. When fired, the vessel is placed on pins so the bottom and sides are hardened during the firing process into one smooth laminated glass surface. You may notice slight pin indentations where the glass has flowed around the pin that supports the base during firing. The pin marks do not compromise the finish or performance of the vessel. Not recommended for glass cooktops. This is your grandmother's pot--and her grandmother's, too. There are good reasons this black porcelain-on-steel cookware, with its classic granitelike styling, proves popular generation after generation. It's inexpensive, lightweight but sturdy, won't rust or corrode, and cleans easily. And it lasts a lifetime and beyond. This big pot is perfect for simmering broths, soups, and sauces; for boiling lots of pasta when the whole family arrives; for steaming heaps of vegetables; and for canning. The pot stands 12 inches high and is 11-1/4 inches in diameter. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

Warranty: -Lifetime Warranty. The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks with all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between the exterior and an 18/10 stainless-steel interior is a thick aluminum core that spreads heat evenly across the bottom of the pan and all the way up its sides. The interior is 18/10 stainless steel, highly polished so it's stick- as well as stain- and corrosion-resistant. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. This 6-quart stockpot makes clear why All-Clad Stainless is so popular. Though not classically tall and narrow, it simmers soups and stocks and accommodates enough rag Bolognese to feed all the relatives. It's also ideal for braising on the stovetop or in the oven. Because the aluminum core extends up the sides, foods cook uniformly, even though the pot is 4-1/4 inches deep (11 inches in diameter). And because the interior is nonreactive, tomatoes and other acidic foods won't taste metallic. Its lid and stay-cool loop handles are riveted for strength and won't be harmed by an oven's highest heat. Although Stainless cookware is dishwasher-safe, hand washing is recommended. <i>--Fred Brack</i> <b>From the Manufacturer</b> <br> <b>All-Clad Stainless Construction</b> <br> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cookware/allclad.stainless.gif" width="244" height="129" align="left"> Each piece of All-Clad cookware features a unique metal bonding construction. All-Clad Stainless cookware sandwiches a thick core of three separate layers of aluminum between an easy-to-clean, highly polished 18/10 stainless-steel cooking surface and a magnetic stainless-steel exterior. The aluminum core retains heat and evenly distributes it along the bottom and up the sidewalls of the cookware. The stainless interior is stick-resistant and cleans easily. The magnetic stainless-steel exterior gives the cookware a gleaming finish. All-Clad Stainless also features the companys signature "stay-cool" long handles, lids fashioned from gleaming 18/10 stainless steel, and highly durable stainless-steel rivets.

Designed to work on conventional gas and electric ranges, as well as induction cooktops, All-Clad Stainless cookware is the best-selling collection in a full line that includes All-Clad LTD, Cop-R-Chef, Master Chef 2, and Copper Core. <b>Features and Benefits</b> <br> All-Clad pans with a stainless interior cooking surface are oven-safe up to 500 degrees. All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include: <ul> <li>Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer. <li>Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you wont have "hot spots" when cooking. <li>Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface. <li>Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles. <li>Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods. <li>Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pans edges to seal in flavor of your foods. <li>The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops. <li>The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface. </ul> <b>Warranty</b> <br> From date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keepers Friend. To use the Bar Keepers Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keepers Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keepers Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

Yet, you dont have to be a serious cook to make restaurant-quality pizza: an Old Stone Oven pizza stone makes it easy. <br><br> Made of the same material as the Old Worlds legendary brick pizza ovens, these stones absorb the ovens intense heat and transfer it evenly to your bread and pizza dough. The result is the pizzeria pizza you crave, every time. The crust, crispy and slightly charred, gives way to light, airy chew. Tomatoes burst on your tongue under golden bubbles of cheese. <br> Invented by Chicago pizza enthusiast, cookware purveyor, and restaurant critic Pasquale Pat Bruno more than 40 years ago, Old Stone Oven pizza stones are the original stones for home oven use. Thicker than other stones, their porosity and heat retention create a multilayered crunchy-chewy crust. Manufactured in the US from a special blend of lead-free clays, they are kiln-fired during manufacturing to produce unmatched durability. The stones, therefore, are able to withstand extreme heat and handle temperature changes without cracking. They are oven- and grill safe to 2000 F. <br> This set of two 8 round stones is ideal for making two different personal pizzas. Throw a pizza party or include the kids in family pizza night. Or, use the stones to reheat pizzeria leftovers or elevate store-bought frozen pizza to new levels. <br> Bring the taste of the Old World home with Old Stone Oven. Professional pizza and traditional European bread ovens are often lined with stone or brick. This is so heat is stored up and redistributed evenly. The resulting blast of heat from the Old Stone Oven Pizza for Two baking stones gives bread and pizza a nice chewy crust. The rustic French tarts called galettes are also well suited to a baking stone. To use the stone, place it in a cold oven and preheat to 500 degrees for pizza, or according to the recipe for bread or galettes. The stone is made of the same material that lines blast furnaces and kilns, so it can handle ultra-high temperatures. Wait until the baking stones are entirely cooled before attempting to clean them. Let them dry completely before using again. Some discoloration will occur over time; this is natural and will not affect baking. Using baking parchment may help delay that discoloration. Do not bake cookies, turnovers or other high-fat items on the stones; the stone would absorb the fat and proceed to produce smoke and bad odors. The stones come with a flyer that contains detailed use and cleaning instructions, as well as recipes for bread, pizza dough, and two pizza toppings. <i>--Garland Withers</i>"	COL title VAL "Polder IBC-9354-160 54-Inch Light Use Replacement Ironing Pad and Cover, Metallic Toast Pattern" COL feature VAL "100% Cotton Cover/100% Polyester Felt Pad Imported Fits ironing boards sized 54-inch by 15-17-inch.

Plus, its right there in the name and its totally trueyou can use this grill just as easily outdoors as you can indoors. Its made possible by the removable grill stand thats sturdy on the patio and can be removed for countertop grilling. Add in the durable nonstick coating and the patented fat-removing slope, and youve got the power to create large, tasty portions of everyones favorites with simple cleanup, to boot. Whatand wherewill you grill. Tip-control moisture of foods, to some extent, by opening or closing lid vent. Turn lid handle or vent clockwise to open vent for drier cooking. Turn counterclockwise to hold in moisture for moister meats. Light on temperature control probe will cycle on and off as grill thermostat maintains proper temperature. This is normal operation. Note-condensation may collect on inside of lid when cooking Grilling really can't get much easier than this. After assembling the grill (which takes only a few minutes), simply plug it in and allow about 10 minutes to fully preheat the surface while you gather your steaks, kebabs, or whatever's to be grilled. The electric heat has an adjustable range from low (for keeping food warm) to high (for searing steaks). The nonstick grill surface not only means you can use a minimum of added fat, but it also makes cleanup a cinch. The surface has a subtle slope, with channels that draw accumulated fat or other liquids into a tray just below the surface. The high domed and vented lid helps create a circular flow of hot air to ensure even cooking--particularly important for a large roast or whole chicken. The grill can be placed either directly on a tabletop or atop its pedestal. On its own, the grill surface stands about 6 inches high; with the pedestal, it stands about 2-1/2 feet high, not counting the domed lid. The pedestal is plenty sturdy for cooking, but the grill still seems a bit top-heavy, so pay special attention if grilling in a high-traffic area or near kids. Because of the easy electric heat, this grill can be used outdoors or indoors--when using it indoors, though, be prepared for potential spattering, steam, or other side effects of cooking. <I>--Cynthia Nims</I>"	1

Ich, also called white spot disease, is a highly contagious and destructive, microscopic parasite that burrows into gill and skin tissue, causing severe damage and secondary infections. Early symptoms include white spots, darting and scratching against surfaces while more advanced stages can cause labored breathing. This freshwater fish treatment not only helps cure Ich, but it also provides a synthetic slime coat that helps protect against secondary infection, where the natural slime coating of the fish has been disturbed by the parasite. Use at the first sign of "Ich" or white spots. Some scaleless fish are sensitive to this medication, so treat them with 1/2 the normal dose. Some saltwater invertebrates, such as corals, may be sensitive to this product, so it is not recommended for reef aquariums. This medication will cause a slight discoloration of water which can be easily removed by adding activated carbon to the filter. Dose according to directions on product packaging and label. This treatment can be used in freshwater or saltwater aquariums. With API Aquarium products, its easy to keep a beautiful saltwater, freshwater or reef aquarium. For over 50 years, API has been creating innovative, research-driven solutions that make it easier to care for your fish and aquarium.

COL title VAL "Seachem Reef Calcium 500ml" COL feature VAL "Organic calcium Maintains peak coral growth Will not alter pH" COL description VAL "Reef Calcium is a concentrated (50,000 mg/L) bioavailable polygluconate complexed calcium intended to maintain calcium in the reef aquarium without altering pH.Polygluconate complexation confers several benefits: it increases the bioavailability of the calcium, it provides a rich source of metabolic energy to help maintain peak coral growth, and it prevents calcium precipitation/alkalinity depletion. Polygluconate contains no nitrogen or phosphorous, thus it is biologically impossible for it to lead to algae growth in a properly maintained reef system. Reef Calcium may be used alone to maintain calcium but will provide enhanced levels of coral growth when used in conjunction with an ionic calcium supplement (Reef Complete, Reef Advantage Calcium). Reef Calcium is intended to maintain calcium levels; if calcium becomes seriously depleted one should either perform a water change or use an ionic calcium supplement to restore the depleted level of calcium."

Bulbs from China will arrive dead. If coming from other sellers this product will not be guaranteed! Ships from Easy to Grow Bulbs, a California Licensed Nursery" COL description VAL "Put two inches of planting mix in a pot. Set the Amaryllis bulb in the pot and spread out the roots. (Roots must remain undamaged). Gently pack potting mix between the roots and around the bulb, cover 2/3rds of the bulb in planting mix leaving top third of the bulb above the soil line. Place the pot in a sunny, warm location. Water once with luke warm water when you first pot up your Amaryllis bulb, then sparingly until you see the tip of the bud appear. Then water regularly (do not overwater) and you will soon be rewarded with spectacular blooms. If the bulb has already started growing plant as soon as possible and the bulb will straighten itself out. When blooms fade, cut off the tubular flower stems near the top of the bulb, leaving the foliage to continue growing. Water as usual and apply a water-soluble fertilizer every four weeks. Once the danger of frost has passed place your amaryllis pot outdoors in your garden where it can enjoy the summer sun. Be sure to continue your fertilizer program every four weeks as this is necessary for the next round of indoor forcing. Bring your Amaryllis inside at the end of the summer and allow the bulb to completely dry out by storing it in a cool dry place. Now repot your Amaryllis in fresh potting soil and start the growing cycle all over again. Spread some pebble or marbles over the mix for a nice appearance. Keep from drafty doors and windows. Cut off spent stalks, additional stalks will appear as others fade. Amaryllis are tropical bubls and prefer temperatures around 70F (20C) All plants grow toward the light, turning the pot regularly will ensure straight stems. Plant bulbs in two week intervals for a constant parade of color during the winter months"	COL title VAL "Oregon 91PXL056G Chamfer Chisel w/Ramped D" COL feature VAL "Drive Links 56; Pitch 3/8"; Gauge .050 Replaces: Oregon 91PX056G Fits: CS-280, CS-290, CS-300, CS-3000, CS-300EVL, CS-301, CS-302, CS-302S, CS-303T, CS-305, CS-306, CS-310, CS-315, CS-330EVL, CS-330MX4, CS-330T, CS-340, CS-3400, CS-341, CS-345, CS-3450, CS-346, CS-351, CS-352, CS-355T, CS-360T, CS-370, CS-370F, CS-370T, CS-400, CS-400F, ECS-2000, ECS-3000" COL description VAL "16" Oregon Chain 3/8" pitch, 050 gauge 56 drive links 16" Oregon Chain for many Echo, Husqvarna, Jonsered & Poulan saws. 3/8" pitch, .050 gauge. 91VG-56 chain.

The router's electronic variable-speed trigger lets you select from between 8,000 and 24,000 rpm for specific applications. And because this system employs full electronic feedback, you can trust the router to provide constant speed under load. In addition, the motor's soft start reduces start-up torque for optimum control. The router's fixed base features a micro-fine depth-adjustment ring that provides precise bit adjustments in 1/64-inch increments. Because the ring--not the motor can--turns to adjust bit depth, a constant switch/cordset location is maintained when you are using the router in a table. This minimizes difficulty in turning the unit on and off and keeps operation consistent. The plunge base features an adjustable five-position turret stop for use when making repeated plunge cuts. The easy-to-reach plunge-release lever and switch keep control at your fingertips during routing. <b>Quick, Secure Base and Bit Changes</b><br>The clear, LEXAN sub-base offers optimum bit visibility and base durability, and it accepts standard template-guide bushings to make application-specific setups easy. Also, a sub-base concentricity gauge is included. If you insert this into the collet prior to bit installation, it will help you center the sub-base relative to bit location when making your cut line off of the side of the base. Moreover, the sub-base and other included bases are designed to make both base and bit changes easy. Quick-release motor latches allow for fast and easy motor-pack removal, while a spindle-lock button allows for single-wrench bit changes. The fixed base also offers a flat top, so the router can be set upside down for easy bit and depth changes. Additionally, long, self-releasing, eight-slotted collets provide improved bit retention and prevent bits from jamming. <b>Built for Consistency and Durability</b><br>Routing applications produce a lot of dust, which can result in extra wear and tear on electronic parts. That's why this system features a dust-sealed switch that protects against dust ingestion for longer tool life. Other components that contribute to the tool's overall consistency and durability include heavy-duty metal housings, precision-machined brass bushings, and case-hardened steel guide rods on the plunge base. <b>Comfortable Operation with Integrated Dust Control</b><br>Each base features comfortable rubber over-molded handles and a low center of gravity for improved balance and control and reduced user fatigue. The base also has a patented through-the-column dust-collection system. This allows a vacuum to be attached to the router without blocking your line of sight. In addition, this router kit offers you the ability to work with the switch and cordset on either your left or right side. Also contributing to this setup's usability is a detachable cordset that can be easily serviced. A shorty cord motor pack is not required if you opt to place the motor can in a D-Handle base.

A number of well-known professional gourmet chefs through the world use Chroma knives in their kitchens. They are a welcome addition to any chef's kitchen. Cutting with a Chroma Type 301 knife is like driving a Porsche, and for good reason. Designed by Ferdinand A. Porsche (the designer of the Porsche 911) with input from renowned Austrian chef Jrg Wrther, Chroma Type 301 cutlery excels in both performance and looks. Sleek and sexy, each knife looks like one seamless piece, but the blade and handle are actually different types of steel. The blade is crafted of superfine Japanese 301 steel and hand-sharpened into an acutely sharp angle for precision cutting. The handle is made of durable 18/10 stainless steel, triangular in profile and flat-topped for leverage, a totally unique and ergonomic design. Announcing the transition spot between handle and blade is a metal "pearl" that lets the fingers know their position, in place of a bolster. The comfort and control, not to mention the spectacular visual appeal, of a Chroma Type 301 knife have made ardent converts of many chefs worldwide. This 5-piece Chroma starter set consists of four versatile knives and a bamboo/wood storage block. In the set you'll find a 3-1/4-inch paring knife for peeling fruit and shaping garnishes; 5-inch utility knife, for everything from slicing an apple to cutting a sandwich; 7-1/4-inch santoku, an Asian chef's knife with a straight edge and rounded spine near the point, exceptional for fine slicing and chopping; and a 10-inch chef's knife, that all-purpose workhorse for chopping, mincing, dicing, and slicing. Two extra slots in the block let you add more knifes as you become addicted to these extraordinary knives. And, a stainless-steel pin through the block unscrews so you can take the whole thing apart for cleaning. After use, Chroma Type 301 knives should be immediately washed and dried by hand. To sharpen, use only a Chroma original 301 whetstone, never a sharpening steel which can damage the fine blades. Chroma Type 301 knives make exceptional gifts and are covered by a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Ann Bieri</I> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> 5-piece cutlery set.

Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico. The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the "Switzerland of America." Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time. During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through "torture tests," such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan "It takes a licking and keeps on ticking." With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches. The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality. One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity. Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you."	0

Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. Part of the popular Four Star line, this hand-honed blade is made with Henckels' Sintermetal Component Technology (SCT), which allows three different grades of steel to be combined to form a single piece, fusing together the blade, bolster, and tang.

The 15mm nib (line width 8-15mm) shape provides the flexibility to achieve multiple line thicknesses and the high quality replaceable nibs ensure precision control on application.

You get the best of both worlds. Once applied, all the water in the paint evaporates quickly in the atmosphere to leave a flexible acrylic film of color behind. This is permanent and doesnt move - which means you can overpaint or varnish without bleeding to achieve multi-layered surface effects. Sheer or solid color, or something in between? Each pigment has its own unique character and this dictates its opacity. Our professional acrylic paint is formulated to let the pigment express itself fully, so you have a choice of opaque, semi-opaque and transparent colors to help you achieve a range of effects. Check the opacity symbol on the barrel. On a clients wall. In a gallery. Your work needs to stay as you intended. The pigments in Acrylic Markers are lightfast. This means your work will have the greatest archival permanence possible  at least 50 years+ in gallery conditions  with no color shifting or fading, to stay vibrant and true. A ball and pump valve system inside the marker keeps the paint flowing and the pigment and binder evenly mixed. Give it a good shake before use for best results. If too much paint comes out, its usually because youre pushing down too hard (or often) on the nib. Its easily fixed - wipe away excess paint, dont pump the nib, and your marker should be good to go again. Dirty nibs can be quickly sorted. If youve got other Liquitex colors or paints on your nib, and theyre still wet, take it out and rinse it. If its dried on or its simply looking a little old and worn out, go for a replacement nib. Theyre easy to fit and return your markers to full precision. Remember to always store markers horizontally and to keep lids on when not in use, to stop the paint drying out. Liquitex intermixability gives you the power to combine any of our paints and mediums, any way you like. Compatible binders let you seamlessly layer, blend and mix all our products with stable, archival results."

Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Pro Plan until you're feeding Pro Plan exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly. Feeding for Adult Maintenance: It is important that you feed Pro Plan to your adult cat "free choice" throughout the day, rather than as just a single feeding only at mealtime. Food intake required to maintain ideal body condition will vary, depending on age, activity and environment. Watch your cat's weight and adjust food amounts accordingly. If you have a kitten, or a pregnant or nursing cat, you should continue feeding Pro Plan Focus Kitten Chicken & Rice Formula. Store in a cool, dry place."

Keep them in indirect sunlight and 100% humidity using a seed sprouter or humidity dome and a seedling heating mat until the seeds sprout. The temperature must be kept above 75 degrees F at all times. <b>Growth Habit:</b> Miracle fruit is a slow growing evergreen bush or tree that is easily pruned to the desired height. <b>Culture Location:</b> Young plants need a constant tropical environment (warmth and <b>high humidity</b>), but mature plants will tolerate brief periods of household temperatures as long as they are not subject to direct heat. In the summer the plant should be moved outdoors to a warm, humid, lightly shaded spot. <b>Fruit:</b> The fruit is a small red, ellipsoid berry approximately 1/2 inch long and contains a single seed. The fruit are produced in flushes many months of the year. Although not sweet itself, when a fruit is eaten and the pulp allowed to coat the taste buds, an miraculous effect occurs. A slice of lemon or lime will taste deliciously sweet. The marvelous aroma and sweetness of the citrus remains but the sourness is almost completely covered.

It's never too early to develop a good poker face. With <i>Rat-a-Tat Cat</i>, a poker face is just one of the skills players need to perfect. As in poker, luck, skill, strategy, and intuition each play a part. Players are dealt four cards, which are kept face- down, except for a quick peek at two of them. Each player in turn pulls a card from the draw pile to replace one of the four. Memory is important, as the object is to end with the lowest score, and players must keep track of the values on their four cards. "Peek," "Swap," and "Draw Two" Power cards turn up occasionally, allowing players to maneuver and strategize further. Delightfully witty pictures of cats (the good guys--low points) and rats (bad guys--high points) illustrate each of the 54 cards. Young card sharks will develop a sense of timing and greater ease with numbers, and can begin to grasp the concept of probability.

The Great Basin base is 18 ft. x 10 ft. x 76" center height. With Back to back dutch "D" style doors, two mesh windows and roof vents for ventilation. Constructed with welded polyethylene floor and fiberglass frame, with steel and plastic stakes to secure this portable home. Shockcorded fiberglass poles with pin and ring system for easy set-up and take down. Hooped fly over the front door and rear window for weather protection. Spacious and weather-resistant, the Wenzel Great Basin 18-by-10-foot dome tent sleeps up to nine campers in its two rooms, making it ideal for large families or smaller families with lots of gear. The Great Basin is made of rugged, weather-repellent Weather Armor polyester with a polyurethane coating for reliability, helping it keep water out and warmth in. The sonic-sealed polyethylene tub-style floor, meanwhile, is welded and not sewn, eliminating needle holes that might otherwise attract water seepage. And campers will love the variety of ventilation points--including two mesh back-to-back D-style doors and two polyester mesh windows--all of which are aided by an updraft ventilation system that improves the overall airflow. The Great Basin is also easy to set up, with a shock-corded fiberglass frame and a pin-and-ring system. And when it comes time to hit the sheets, you can either create one huge sleeping room or roll down the divider curtain to create two separate rooms. The rooms can function as individual bedrooms for the campers or as a sleeping room and living room. Other details include two gear lofts for storage, two hanging pockets, a removable fly with a hoop frame over the door, and a storage duffel. <b>Specifications:</b><ul> <li>Base: 18 by 10 feet <li>Center height: 76 inches <li>Area: 159 square feet <li>Capacity: 9 people <li>Stakes: Steel and plastic <li>Carrying weight: 24 pounds </ul> <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong> <br><strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all-purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in. If you're a backpacker, alpine climber, or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to buy something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall, and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three-season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are specifically designed for summer backpacking or other activities. Many premium tents will also feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain fly for enhanced waterproofing. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four-season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types: freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and tents that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floorplan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being lighter. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering. "	0

This replica (now with the word "classic" in the title) is a fun, inexpensive shot of nostalgia, though its design will be lost on new pigskin fans because this isn't so much football, but a football-like exercise. The object of the game is to control a lone running back around LED defenders--little red dashes, to be precise--to get first downs on the way to a touchdown, or at least a field goal. Players anticipate the moves of the computer-controlled defenders to slide through gaps without being tackled. It plays as much like <I>Space Invaders</I> as football, but that simplicity makes it hypnotically fun. The same cheesy beeps trumpet tackles, kickoffs, and touchdowns.

This sander is compatible with standard sandpaper, stick on sandpaper, sanding sheets for paint, and sanding sheets for orbital sanders. <b> Perfect Finish Precision</b><br>The Bosch 1297DK has a 2.0 AMP motor equipped to handle a variety of sanding applications.

The experience starts with the discussion--often the kids get their pick--of what flavor ice cream your family wants to make. Vanilla with bittersweet chocolate chips or maybe peach made with orchard fresh peaches. Every delicious choice is limited only by your imagination. Just set up your White Mountain ice cream maker with ice and rock salt, and let the fun begin. Whether you&rsquo;re cooling off a hot summer picnic or warming up a homebound winter weekend, the experience is one you can&rsquo;t put a price on. <b><i>Our secret is the triple-motion dasher.</i></b> <br/>At the heart of the White Mountain ice cream maker is a uniquely designed, twin-blade "dasher." The outer canister turns clockwise and the blades turn both clockwise and counter clockwise. That triple-motion action continuously folds the ingredient mixture from the outer walls back onto itself creating the smoothest and creamiest down-home ice cream ever made. </td></tr></table>"	COL title VAL "Cuisinart AMB-12MP Chef's Classic Nonstick Bakeware 12-Cup Muffin Pan, Silver" COL feature VAL "12-cup muffin pan for baking moist muffins with crisp tops Heavy-gauge aluminized steel construction heats evenly Whitford Xylan nonstick interior and exterior for easy food release Thick rolled edges prevent warping over time Dishwasher-safe; limited lifetime warranty" COL description VAL "From the premier name in food processors, comes a superior line of bakeware.

Both slots and holes line each side of the frame. The quickest cooking method is to load the six 13-1/2-inch skewers with chunks of meat and/or vegetables, and lay them on top of the frame in the designated slots. The skewers are then rotated by hand while the frame stays in position. The second method is to insert a skewer part-way into a hole on the side, push it through the desired chunks of food, then insert the pointed tip into the hole across the frame. This way the entire frame can be flipped over at once. Measuring 13 by 10-1/4 inches when open for grilling, the frame conveniently folds in half by means of a hinge for compact storage. The nonstick finish makes clean-up easy. To ensure longevity of the finish, washing by hand is recommended. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>"	0

Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. Broan ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105.

But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">In-Ground Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396711">In-ground systems</a> are permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease. Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">Wall-Mount Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396741">Wall-mount systems</a> can be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">Portable Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396731">Portable systems</a> require minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">Backboard Considerations</span></strong><br /> Regardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action. The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular. While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board. "	1

Awarded the Canadian Toy Testing Top Rating For 2 to 4 players ages 3 through 7 years Hand-made in Canada using recycled boards and papers, soy-based inks, water based glues and safe paints" COL description VAL "This game draws the most fan mail! First, gardens are planted. Then everyone rolls the special die to do the harvesting. The job is to harvest the gardens before winter comes. will we get them all? Maybe, if we remember to help each other out! A simple but challenging game for board game beginners. Includes: 12 x 12" board, die, 48 vegetables, winter and spring puzzle pieces, and rules for harder "spring planting" game. Our customers say: "Ryan (5) feels very important getting all his vegetables in and then helping me." - Saskatchewan, Canada <b>Play as friends, not as enemies!</b> Family Pastimes games foster the spirit of cooperation. Players help each other climb a mountain, make a community, complete a space exploration... They never play against each other. After all, the initial impulse to play a game is social; that is, we bring out a game because we want to do something together. How ironic then that in most games, we spend all our efforts trying to bankrupt someone, destroy their armies - in other words, to get rid of one another! At <b>Family Pastimes</b> we believe that people of different ages and abilities should be able to play side by side, each making their best contribution. We are all there together when we finish the game to take joy in our successes and wonder how we might work together even better the next time we play. Thus, Family Pastimes games will prove to be a friendly form of fun. Socialization, entertainment, academic learning, character growth, etc. - whatever your objectives, we invite you to realize them by cooperative means. We hope you enjoy playing and learning together! Children learn the benefits of cooperation in this innovative game from Family Pastimes. Each player tends a small garden composed of four different types of vegetables. The object is for all players to harvest all the vegetables before winter arrives. If one of the four colors comes up when the color-coded die is thrown, then each player may harvest one vegetable of that color from his or her own garden or from any of the other gardens. If the die comes up black, each player may choose which color vegetable to pick. If the die shows a white dot, then a Winter piece must be placed on the board. The game ends when all players harvest all vegetables, or when all six Winter pieces are filled in. Cooperation is encouraged with a few special rules: if a player's garden has been completely harvested and he or she rolls the white dot, then a winter piece is <i>removed</i>. Players are thus subtly encouraged to concentrate on one garden at a time, instead of each tending only to their own gardens. <I>--Michael Fehlauer</I>"	COL title VAL "2003 - New Line / Play Along - Lord of the Rings : Armies of Middle Earth - Ringwraith (On Rearing Horse) - Warriors &amp; Battle Beasts - Battle Scale Figures - Out of Production - Limited Edition - Collectible" COL feature VAL "This incredible line of Lord of the Rings toys are molded on a 2."

Folkmanis has been encouraging young imaginations to blossom since 1976 with its innovative and engaging specialty puppets, promoting creativity and discovery while winning nearly every industry, child development, and kid-tested award. Folkmanis has grown to become the premier manufacturer of plush puppets worldwide, offering over 200 of the most heartwarming and realistically designed creatures--both exotic and familiar--on the market today. Puppets nurture the imagination, inspire creativity, develop interactive play, and expand language. This reviewer has found them to be excellent tools for teaching foreign languages--children will comfortably experiment when manipulating a puppet, but not when simply talking to a friend. As children mature, they are able to use puppets in a more sophisticated manner that will help them last a good long time. Snowy Owl is well made and true to form with her white and gray spotted fur. The texture of her leather beak and talons gives her an air of authenticity, and her large glass eyes ringed with thick white fur won't miss a rodent. A plastic stick inside Snowy Owl's body lets you rotate her head 360 degrees. With a wingspan of 22 inches, she will play a prominent role on the puppet stage. <I>--Sandy Hirsch</I>"	0

Seasoned finish. To season, follow these easy directions - Wash with hot, soapy water and a stiff brush. Rinse and dry thoroughly. Spead a thin coat of solid shortening or vegetable oil over the entire pan including handles and exterior surfaces. Line the lower oven rack with aluminum foil to catch any drippings and preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place cookware upside down on middle rack of oven and bake for 1 hour. Turn off the oven, leaving the cookware in the oven until cool. Your cookware will look slightly brown, instead of the familiar black but it is ready for cooking. It will blacken with cooking. Lodge has been making cast-iron cookware for over 100 years, and thanks to cast iron's excellent durability, some of the original pans are probably still around. It's not hard to see why cast-iron pans are the ones most often passed down from generation to generation--nothing can dent, warp, or bend their heavy construction. This 9-inch griddle pan will meet all grilling needs without any decrease in quality as it ages. In fact, unlike many cooking surfaces, cast iron becomes more stick-resistant with use. Cast iron also has excellent heat retention, so dishes don't need to be cooked over extremely high temperatures. If you're concerned about nutrition, cast iron has been proven to safely add iron to food. Because iron can rust, this pan should not be immersed in water for long periods and should stay out of the dishwasher. Just wash it with soap and water, avoiding abrasive cleaners. <I>--Laura Cuthbert</I>"	COL title VAL "Lodge 10.5 Inch Cast Iron Griddle.

It gives you a nearly non-stick surface, without the possible harmful fumes generated by preheating chemically treated nonstick cookware. The American-based company, Lodge, has been fine-tuning its construction of rugged, cast-iron cookware for more than a century.<br><br> The black patina given to the cookware by the factory seasoning process is, in fact, vegetable oil that has been baked into a piece of cookware that has emerged from an individual sand mold. This coating of oil is a functional application and not a cosmetic application. The cookware is hanging as it rides through the electrostatic sprayer and commercial conveyor ovens at very high temperatures. This allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the pores of the iron which creates an easy release finish. As a result of this process, you may see a blister or bubble of oil at the southern-most point or at the end of the handle of the cookware piece. If visible, it will rub or flake off with your finger, leaving a brown spot. Dont worry, its not rust but a seasoned spot that is brown, indicative of the varnish stage of seasoning. As a matter of fact, this is the color of home seasoned iron until it has been used several times. The brown spot will turn black with use.<br><br> By"	1

Routers don't get any bigger and tougher than this Hitachi workhorse. It has the solid construction, horsepower, and features we've come to expect in a top-of-the-line router. Its heft goes a long way toward eliminating vibration, working with the soft-start motor to cut out torque at startup. Despite its nearly 12 pounds, it actually handles as well as most 3-1/4-horsepower routers we've tried in freehand applications. It has a 1/2-inch collet and a wide sub-base opening, making it suitable for working with all but the very biggest panel bits. It features electronic variable speed, so the router makes clean cuts in a wide range of different materials. We found the controls to be within easy reach of the handles, and though this isn't the quietest router we've used, it comes pretty close. We like the unique eight-position handles that let the tool be adjusted to the worker rather than the other way around. While this is a topnotch plunge router, it's also an excellent choice for table mounting, and many people choose this model for exactly that reason. This is an all-around solid tool that offers more bang per buck than many competing models. <I>--Brian Trinen</I>"	COL title VAL "Estwing Hammer - 20 oz Straight Rip Claw with Smooth Face &amp; Shock Reduction Grip - E3-20S" COL feature VAL "Shock Reduction Grip reduces vibrations caused by impact Head and handle are forged in 1-piece Fully polished head and faces Smooth face Made in the USA <span>         <a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/sign-in.html?ie=UTF8&ref=&email=&redirectASIN=B0000224VC&disableCorpSignUp=&path=%2Fgp%2Fcoupon%2Fc%2APK6CRT5BVH6KFA2KWAJZXU70VKG&redirectProtocol=&mode=&useRedirectOnSuccess=1>Clip this coupon</a> to save 5% on this product when you buy from Amazon.com.                            <span class="a-declarative" data-action="a-modal" data-a-modal="{&quot;width&quot;:&quot;450&quot;,&quot;header&quot;:&quot;Promotion Details&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/gp/promotions/details/popup/APK6CRT5BVH6K&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;600&quot;}">             <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="a-popover-trigger a-declarative">               Here's how             <i class="a-icon a-icon-popover"></i></a>         </span>         (restrictions apply)              </span> <span class="a-size-base a-color-secondary">                 Forged in One Piece             </span> <span class="a-size-base a-color-secondary">                 Build to Last for Generations             </span> <span class="a-size-base a-color-secondary">                 Forged Using Solid American Steel             </span> <span class="a-size-base a-color-secondary">                 Available with Smooth &amp; Milled Faces             </span> <span class="a-size-base a-color-secondary">                 Head Weights 12oz - 30oz             </span> <span class="a-size-base a-color-secondary">                 Available in Finish and Framing Lengths             </span> <span class="a-size-base a-color-secondary">                 Patented Shock Reduction Grip             </span> <span class="a-size-base a-color-secondary">                 Proudly Made in the USA             </span>" COL description VAL "Estwing's Rip Claw Solid Steel Hammer provide unsurpassed balance and temper.

Near perfect in design, the pan is constructed of three layers of metal; two stainless steel outer layers with an aluminum core. The stainless steel exterior combined with the aluminum core allows the pan to be used on all types of stovetops, including induction, and heats the pan evenly to eliminate hot spots. Additionally, the pan has a non-stick coating which makes food removal and clean-up a breeze. The classically sloped sides help prevent messes, and when you're finished cooking, the pan can be hung through the handle's eyelet for convenient storage. Producing some of the finest cookware in the nation, All-Clad has been featured in many high class and gourmet restaurants for its superior performance and aesthetically designed pieces crafted from American artists using the finest metals. A firm believer in quality over convenience, All-Clad's metals are formulated and bonded with cooking performance in mind, and are combined with stunning designs to provide you with the best cooking experience possible. The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the steel. This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 10 inches in diameter, perfect for cooking tuna or tofu, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for a healthful meal. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's heat. Although Stainless cookware is dishwasher-safe, nonstick pieces should be hand washed. <i>--Fred Brack</i> <b>From the Manufacturer</b> <br> <b>All-Clad Stainless Construction</b> <br> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cookware/allclad.stainless.gif" width="244" height="129" align="left"> Each piece of All-Clad cookware features a unique metal bonding construction. All-Clad Stainless cookware sandwiches a thick core of three separate layers of aluminum between an easy-to-clean, highly polished 18/10 stainless-steel cooking surface and a magnetic stainless-steel exterior. The aluminum core retains heat and evenly distributes it along the bottom and up the sidewalls of the cookware. The stainless interior is stick-resistant and cleans easily. The magnetic stainless-steel exterior gives the cookware a gleaming finish. All-Clad Stainless also features the company&#x92;s signature "stay-cool" long handles, lids fashioned from gleaming 18/10 stainless steel, and highly durable stainless-steel rivets. All-Clad Stainless cookware is one of five collections from All-Clad Metalcrafters. Designed to work on conventional gas and electric ranges, as well as induction cooktops, All-Clad Stainless cookware is the best-selling collection in a full line that includes All-Clad LTD, Cop-R-Chef, Master Chef 2, and Copper Core. <b>Features and Benefits</b> <br> All-Clad pans with a stainless interior cooking surface are oven-safe up to 500 degrees. All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include: <ul> <li>Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer. <li>Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you won&#x92;t have "hot spots" when cooking.  <li>Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface. <li>Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles. <li>Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods. <li>Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pan&#x92;s edges to seal in flavor of your foods. <li>The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops.  <li>The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface. </ul> <b>Warranty</b> <br> From date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef).

Nothing sticks to Silpat! Sasa Demarle Inc. was founded in 1965 by M. Guy Demarle in Northern France. Mr. Demarle was an experienced baker who was seeking a better way to make baguette bread with forms using non-stick silicone coatings. He went on to invent the first non-stick baguette baking trays or filets, as they are known in France. A few years later, Mr. Demarle also went on to invent and create the original Silpat and is known around the world as the original non-stick baking liner. Since then, we continue to strive for improvements in non-stick products for the baking, patisserie and food-service industries. Silpat nonstick baking sheets are made of woven glass coated with food-standard silicone. Used daily by professionals, the sheets offer multipurpose uses for preparing, cooking, and heating up food. They're also easy to clean--simply wipe them off using hot water and dish soap. Store them by either rolling them up or keeping them flat. Do not cut Silpat baking sheets with metal, but with DeMarle's Exoglass cutters or knives. Silpat baking sheets replace parchment paper, and are heat-resistant up to 480 degrees F. The Silpat makes any baking sheet nonstick--no greasing necessary. The baking sheets are made in France."	1

The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond.

This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes it clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 12 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep, which is large enough for a professional kitchen but fully functional in a home kitchen, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for healthful meals. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's heat.

All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include: <ul> <li>Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer. <li>Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you wont have "hot spots" when cooking. <li>Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface. <li>Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles. <li>Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods. <li>Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pans edges to seal in flavor of your foods. <li>The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops. <li>The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface. </ul> <b>Warranty</b> <br> From date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keepers Friend. To use the Bar Keepers Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keepers Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration.

COL title VAL "Bodum 5670-01USA Antigua Burr Grinder, Black" COL feature VAL "Hand-forged stainless conical grinder cuts beans instead of crushing Quiet, low-speed grinding gear retains bean flavor/aroma Bean capacity is 1/2 pound of beans or 8 cups Adjustable grind setting and time/quantity control Automatic power cut-out protects grinding gear from stones" COL description VAL "Instead of crushing the coffee beans like most grinders, the Antigua Electric Burr Grinder features a sharp conical blade that deftly cuts the beans to release the maximum amount of flavor. An extra-large bean hopper holds up to 1/2 lb. of beans, or 8 cups, and an inlet cover easily handles beans rich in oil. Adjust the settings to produce powder that's fine, coarse or somewhere in-between and use the time/quantity switch to control the length of the grind cycle. An auto shutoff function protects the gears from accidentally grinding stones, and the powerful motor operates at a noiseless 750 rpm. An airtight lid prevents the coffee from losing its aroma, and a small storage compartment keeps excess cord neatly hidden. Imported. Coffee connoisseurs know that even with excellent coffee beans, the perfect water, and a high-quality brewing machine, coffee still will not be good without the right grind. Bodum's Antigua grinder produces a superior grind by using a sharp, hand-forged, conical stainless-steel blade so that the coffee is cut rather than crushed. An inlet cover over the blade makes it easy to grind oily beans. In addition, the two-step grinding gear has a powerful motor so that the rotation is quiet and occurs at low speeds. This keeps the beans from overheating, thereby retaining the coffee's flavor and aroma. Measuring 8 by 10-1/2 inches, the Antigua is designed to be a smaller version of professional burr grinders for in-home use, occupying only as much counter space as a traditional 10-cup coffeemaker. Although the unit is compact, the bean container can hold up to 1/2 pound of coffee beans at a time. An airtight lid fits on the bean container and keeps beans from losing their aroma. Three grinding settings let drinkers choose their grind: fine for espresso, medium for filter coffee machines, or coarse for French press coffeemakers (or anywhere in between settings if an intermediate-level grind is desired). The timer/quantity control sets the number of minutes the beans will be grind, based on how many cups of coffee are being brewed, what type of beans are being used, and what the level of grind is. Both the bean container and the ground coffee container are transparent to monitor the grinding process, and the ground coffee container easily pulls out of the grinder for use. An automatic power cut-out feature prevents permanent damage to the grinder by turning off the grinding gear in the event that a stone finds its way into the Antigua. The grinding gear also can be disassembled for cleaning. The Antigua comes with adequate power cord storage beneath the unit for excess cord length and a .25-ounce coffee scoop. <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>"	0

The blade is well-suited to cutting both hard-and softwood, as well as cutting through stacks of manmade material. It features teeth with a triple-chip grind (TCG). In this configuration, each flat-top tooth is followed by a trapezoidal tooth that's slightly higher. The trapezoidal tooth delivers a precut slot that's narrower than the final kerf, which helps prevent brittle materials--like chipboard--from chipping near the blade. Plus, the large gullets between these teeth ensure quicker cuts and easy chip removal. The blade's ideal crosscutting range includes materials that are 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thick, while the range when ripping includes materials that are 3/8 to 3/4-inch thick. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This heavy-duty saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide "general purpose blend." Formulated to maximize density, hardness, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance, this blend is ideally matched to the varied demands that are placed on a multi-purpose saw blade. With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money. <b>Silver I.C.E. Coating Resists Corrosion, Heat, and Resin Buildup</b><br>This blade is finished with Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which resists corrosion for improved performance over time. This unique coating also resists heat buildup, protecting your saw and your work surface and preventing the blade from warping. It also helps prevent resin or "pitch" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup means longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry. Freud is one of the few manufacturers of woodworking tools in the world that produces its own MicroGrain Carbide with Titanium, called TiCo, a high-density combination of Titanium and Cobalt.

Otherwise Classic knives are identical to other W&uuml;sthof knives, embodying all the virtues that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high- carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. With its long, narrow blade, this 10-inch knife neatly cuts the biggest ham into thin slices. It also can be used for roasts, poultry, and smoked salmon. Alternating hollows on each side of the blade create air pockets, allowing slices to fall away cleanly and permitting thinner slicing. Like all fine knives, it should be hand washed. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

COL title VAL "Radius cutting attachment" COL feature VAL "Allows the turning of a ball end or concave or convex radii on the ends of parts A complete ball can be turned in a two-step operation Can accommodate parts up to about 1-1/2 diameter" COL description VAL "The radius cutting attachment swings a tool through an arc to put a radius on the end of a part. The pivot points and tool position are adjustable, so it is capable of cutting either a concave or convex shape. It came about as a result of studying the method used to shape grinding wheels. Conventional thinking says that lathe tools should move parallel to the tools longitudinal axis or horizontally across it. Once it was realized that the tool could also be pivoted vertically on this axis, the design of this tool became much easier to conceive. Believe it or not, a technician with a need to cut an accurate radius to make prosthetic eyeballs got us started on putting this tool into production. Now anyone with a need to put a nice looking radius on the end of a part can benefit from the way this accessory makes it easy. It may not be something that a lot of people need, but it is typical of our commitment to serve all of our customers. If you need to (or just think it would be fun to) put a radius onto or into the end of a part, there is no easier way to do it than with this accessory. It can also cut a complete ball in a two-step operation covered in the instructions. Note that the width of this attachment requires that your Sherline lathe have a 6 crosslide table. Older lathes that have the 4 table will not be wide enough. You can upgrade your lathe to the 6 table by ordering the following parts and changing tables. P/N 44880 crosslide table, P/N 44210 (inch) or P/N 44220 (metric) leadscrew. All other parts transfer from your old table. Changing tables is very easy."	1

This knife sharpener is remarkably easy to use on both straight-edge and serrated knives. Simply plug it in, turn it on, and feed knife blades through the stages. The first sharpening stage uses 100 percent diamond abrasive disks to hone the knife's edge while the second stage incorporates polymer disks to polish and strop the edge to hairsplitting sharpness. Straight-edge knives should go through both stages, while serrated blades should only be used in the polishing stage. The internal elastomeric spring guides hold knife blades at just the right angle to the sharpening surfaces, making sharpening easy. The instructions are easy to follow, and maintenance is limited to removing the metal dust shavings from the clean-out tray once a year or so; no lubrication is necessary for the motor, bearings, or sharpening surfaces. Guaranteed not to detemper, the sharpener has a two-year warranty for home use. <i>--Ariel Meadow Stallings</i>"	1

The game is a perfect pastime for anyone with an imagination and includes everything an ordinary pirate would need from ships and doubloons, to jewels and maps. In the game you will choose a ship and then take part in an exploration for your treasure along with the other players. At the end, whoever ends up with the most treasure wins! Everything you need to play comes in a handsome dark finish wood pirate chest that can be attractively displayed in any home, office or study.   11" L x 8-1/2" W x 5" H Heres a new concept: the board game as heirloom.

But the possibility of mutiny, plunder, or some other type of disaster, keeps things interesting, and makes for plenty of strategic maneuvering. <i>--David Stoesz</i>"	COL title VAL "LEGO Star Wars Set #7131 Anakin's Podracer" COL feature VAL "134-piece Lego set Cobble together the same makeshift podracer Anakin constructed in Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace Delicate craft that's nearly a foot long from the tail of the cockpit to the tip of its adjustable air scoops Includes 1.75-inch-high figures of Anakin (with a pair of flip-up goggles) and Queen Amidala disguised as Padm Even get pieces for a Podrace pennant and a cute one-eyed pit droid" COL description VAL "While working as a slave for junk-dealer Watto in Mos Espa, Jedi prodigy Anakin Skywalker quickly taught himself to repair, build, and even pilot podracers.

COL title VAL "KONG Stuff-A-Ball Dog Toy" COL feature VAL "Use as a fetch stick that's both safe and reliable Helps clean teeth and soothe gums Made in the USA. Globally Sourced Materials. Available in three sizes: S, M and L Available in four sizes: S, M, L and XL" COL description VAL "The KONG Stuff-a-Ball is perfect for stuffing with KONG Snacks or for filling the patented Denta-Ridges(TM) with KONG Easy Treat. The best of all possible worlds: the Kong Stuff-a-Ball is a treat dispenser, a wild-bouncing rubber "ball," and a dental cleaning device all in one. Made from the same super-durable, puncture-resistant, non-toxic rubber as classic Kong toys, it's designed to hold treats that dispense as a dog rolls the ball, chews, and plays. Wedge biscuits into the center ports and smear peanut butter or Kong brand Stuff 'N Pastes in the crevices, and extracting the contents becomes a "hunt" to keep any pooch happy and busy for hours while their owner's away. For the pooch with separation anxiety or problem behaviors, chewing on a Stuff-a-Ball provides boredom prevention, stress relief, and intellectual stimulation while she's home alone. Not to mention the dental benefits: the Stuff-a-Ball's ridged exterior grooves gently "squeegee" teeth and gums clean, helping prevent plaque and tartar buildup (not to mention canine halitosis). Try smearing doggy toothpaste (or Kong Stuff 'N Breath Treat) into the exterior grooves to motivate your dog to chew and freshen her breath at the same time. Best of all, the irregularly shaped design produces a goofy, unpredictable bounce that will keep your dog's attention far longer than a conventional round ball. Measuring three inches in diameter, this Stuff-a-Ball is recommended for small- to medium-sized breeds like beagles, cocker spaniels, and pugs. Regularly inspect your ball for cracks or missing chunks, and replace worn or damaged toys to avoid a choking hazard. Satisfaction is guaranteed; if either you or your dog aren't happy with your purchase, return within 30 days for a full refund.<I>--Mary Park</I>"	COL title VAL "Lee's 50/65 Premium Undergravel Filter, 18-Inch by 36-Inch" COL feature VAL "The larger plate sizes reduce the number of plates required The added strength of the UGF plates makes this filter most preferred by saltwater aquarists Size: 18-inch by 36-inch" COL description VAL "Lee's Premium Undergravel Filters have a multi-level plate design made of special quality plastic which resists splitting or cracking"	0

A top-quality fence is critical to the performance of any router table system, and this system relies on the feature-loaded ProFence. Its heavy-duty, one-piece aluminum frame is fully machined on the front and bottom surfaces to ensure it's flat, true, and square. Easy-adjust sub-fences and bit guard are also included. The ProTop Contractor provides a flexible setup that can be adjusted to project-specific needs, with an aluminum miter accessory track that is adjustable to fit all standard miter gauges, plus accessory T-slots on both the table and fence that are perfect for mounting featherboards, stops, fence risers, and switches. This allows you to accommodate the full range of router applications, from cutting dadoes and slots to crafting precise joints. For work with large panels, this table also offers dual fence slots, so you can flip the fence around quickly and easily. An integrated 2-1/2-inch dust port fits standard shop vac hoses to help keep your work area clear of debris for safety, visibility, and operator comfort. <b>Dependable Construction for Tough Jobs</b><br>The non-marring laminate top is built using stress-skin construction for strength and flatness, and it measures 24 x 16 inches to provide a large work area. Exclusive twin steel rails support your router, while the enclosed birch plywood cabinet reduces dust and noise, and its solid panel construction makes it stronger than cheap plastic or stamped steel stands. The cabinet's rubber feet prevent table slippage and double as isolation mounts for dramatically reduced vibration. This table's setup will accept any router, and the included router plate is predrilled to make installation extra-easy for most popular routers from leading brands like Craftsman, DeWalt, Fein, Hitachi, Makita, Ryobi, and Skil. The 15-inch inside-cabinet height provides plenty of space for whatever router you use, plus room for Bench Dog's ProLift and other accessories (not included). This portable router table weighs just 40 pounds, and it requires assembly. It is backed by a limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Bench Dog</b><br>Bench Dog offers a growing line of router tables, safety accessories, and tools for everyone from building and woodworking professionals to schools and serious beginners. The company began in 1995 with Norston Fontaine, Karen Slatter, and the simple idea that great tools are the result of great design and solid engineering.

This 3-1/2-inch Mundial 5100 paring knife is ideal for all your small-scale cutting tasks, such as slicing petite fruits and vegetables. For many chefs, nothing beats the ergonomic comfort or classic styling of fully forged cutlery in "basic black." Mundial's 5100 Series Black is just that. The company's oldest line of fully forged knives, it exemplifies all the expertise that Mundial has acquired through its more than 70 years of crafting gourmet knives. 5100 Series Black is fully forged from high-carbon stainless steel and features a durable polyacetal handle in the traditional three-rivet style. <b> The Value of a Fully-Forged Knife </b><br> Mundial knives, with very few exceptions, are fully forged in a manufacturing process that combines innovative technology with old-world tradition and expertise. In the forging process, steel is heated to an extremely high temperature, set into a die, and hammered into the shape of the basic blade. Following a heating and cooling process, the forged blade is ground to create a full taper to the cutting edge. The result is a stronger, thicker, more resilient blade that flares smoothly at the heel to blend into the shape of the handle. Fully forged cutlery offers an array of key benefits, including greater tensile strength, increased durability, lasting sharpness, and better balance and control. <b>Construction</b><br> Mundial's computer-aided design creates the perfect shape and balance for chopping, dicing, and slicing all types of food. The knives are fully forged from high-carbon chrome molybdenum stainless steel for the best edge retention and sharpening ease. Each knife also undergoes Mundial's computerized blade grinding and polishing process to create a precise taper from tip to bolster (the quality bolster is the main feature of any truly forged knife). Busy chefs will appreciate the ergonomically crafted handles with full tangs, which deliver comfort, balance, and durability. Every Mundial knife is also hand sharpened and individually tested for ultimate performance. <b>Quality Control</b><br> How do Mundial knives compare to other premium cutlery? In addition to its extensive quality control procedures, Mundial regularly submits its products to an international independent testing facility. These standardized testing methodologies continue to show that Mundial knives are among the best in the world."	1

Near perfect in design, the pan is constructed of three layers of metal; two stainless steel outer layers with an aluminum core. The stainless steel exterior combined with the aluminum core allows the pan to be used on all types of stovetops, including induction, and heats the pan evenly to eliminate hot spots. Additionally, the pan has a non-stick coating which makes food removal and clean-up a breeze. The classically sloped sides help prevent messes, and when you're finished cooking, the pan can be hung through the handle's eyelet for convenient storage.

The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the steel. This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 10 inches in diameter, perfect for cooking tuna or tofu, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for a healthful meal. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg.

The stone is prefilled with oil to save time and eliminate the need to presoak it prior to use. The oil prevents metal from bonding with the abrasive surface by flushing away dislodged abrasive and metal chips. This oilstone is commonly used to replace a stone in the Norton IM313 sharpening system, or as a bench stone, to restore cutting edges on straight-edged tools such as chisels, knives, plane blades, and precision instruments. This silicon carbide stone is fast-cutting, and offers effective sharpening even under light pressure. It is created by grading silicon carbide to a consistent particle size and blending it with bonding agents. It is then molded and surface-finished. Unusually large dimensions of 1/2 x 11-1/2 x 2-1/2 inches (H x W x D) make this stone suitable for bench use. (H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back.) Like most oilstones, it is harder and more durable than a waterstone. It conforms to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) abrasive grit standards. Sharpening stones, or whetstones, are abrasive surfaces used to sharpen and hone the edges of steel cutting implements, such as chisels, knives, scissors, hand scrapers, and plane blades. Sharpening is the process of creating or re-establishing a cutting edge by grinding away portions of the metal to adjust the angle of the edge and reform the shape. Honing removes small imperfections. Stones can be flat, for working flat edges, or shaped, for edges that are more complex. Sharpening stones are made of natural or synthetic materials that range from softer to harder, and are categorized by the size of their abrasive particles, known as grit. A stone with a coarser grit is used when more metal needs to be removed (e.g., when sharpening a nicked or very dull blade); the stone with the finest grit produces the sharpest edge. Where numbers are assigned to specify grit, they range from coarser grit (low) to finer grit (high). Some sharpening stones are designed for use with a lubricating liquid, some can be used dry, and others can be used either wet or dry. When used with lubricating liquid, a sharpening stone can be called a waterstone or an oilstone, based on the lubricant required. Norton Abrasives manufactures sanding, grinding, and polishing abrasives, and has been located in the United States since 1885. Norton, now a brand of Saint-Gobain, meets ISO 9000 and 14001 certification for quality and environmental management standards. JM6 Medium Grit Crystolon@ IM313 Replacement Stones are Bench Oilstones made with fast cutting man-made abrasives for quick edge sharpening. Use to sharpen dull edges quickly and upgrade the finish left by a Coarse Crystolon stone. Norton Crystolon@ oilstones are manufactured using a proprietary process that impregnates them with a petroleum based product that allows the lubrication used during the sharpening process to stay on the stone's surface. As a result, the metal from the object being sharpened and small pieces of abrasive that break off the stone become suspended in the lubricant. This prevents these materials from imbedding into the sharpening stone's surface, keeping it free cutting and making it easy to keep its surface clean."	0

The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. You can use this knife for slicing vegetables, chopping meats, or cutting fruits for a healthy fruit salad. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 8-inch chef's knife is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

Jake the drake likes to splash in a puddle<br> Take him home and give him a cuddle<br> Quack, Quack, Quack, he will say<br> He's so glad you're here to play! Make no mistake about Jake; he is one proud drake. He was born April  16, 1997. This guy is fashion conscious from head to tail--both are a  cheery teal. The top of his body is light gray and the tops of his  wings are a contrasting darker gray. The underside of Jake's body,  wings, and tail are a lovely cream color, as is the ring around his  neck. His beak and feet are a golden brown, and his beautiful brown  chest is a stand out. Black button eyes and thread nostrils make this  duck the leader of the flock. Jake is fun for children and adults  alike; he is also highly collectible. Surface wash only. <i>--Peggy  Etra</i>"	0

A programmable controller allows you to customize the Shadowstrike with special features before starting on a mission, so you're as prepared as possible for what lies ahead. The Shadowstrike&#x92;s best attributes are speed and agility, having a tripodlike build, but it also offers some strength. Its signature feature is the grabbing arm protruding from the front of its body, allowing it to grasp at things in its way. Having two robots work against each other on a mission is possible if you have multiple LEGO Spybotics, or a friend with one. A computer and three each of both AA and AAA batteries are required, none of which are included. <I>--Pam Lauer</I>"	COL title VAL "Seagrave K-type Pumper - 1971 diecast 1:64 fire truck model (Amercom SF-29) by Unknown" COL feature VAL "Seagrave K-type Pumper - diecast 1:64 fire truck model" COL description VAL "Model packed in blister."	0

Includes: -Includes 40 tooth thin kerf carbide tipped blade, dust bag and elbow, flip-up crown stops, multi-purpose tool, wrench set, and vertical quick clamp. It's a small thing, we know, but our favorite feature on this gorgeous saw is the handle. That's because everybody has his or her own comfort zone: Some like a vertical grip, some a horizontal. Left-handers usually prefer a handle that tilts 45 degrees to the left. It's all here. The four-position handle features two safety lock buttonsone on each end of the handle, for right- and left-handers-and one must be pressed to allow the saw to power up. At this saw's heart is a beefy, Bosch-quality 15-amp motor with a no-load max of 3,800 rpm and peak 3 HP. Around it, you'll find one plus after another. We like the super-wide miter range of 52 degrees both left and right, because as you know, sometimes the world isn't perfect. It bevels from 0 to 47 degrees left and 0 to 46 right, with the range selector and lock knobs right up front where they should be. The 10 miter detents can all be overridden easily for micro-fine adjustments. The sliding extensions are handy, and we like the integrated workpiece clamps and especially the flip-up crown stops. Another important feature to us is that the scales are clear and legible, even for those of us who won't admit we need bifocals. One more nice touch is the option of replacing the kerf insert for different blades, creating a zero-clearance insert that will minimize tearout. We know Bosch to be fastidious about calibrating their tools before they leave the factory, but to be safe, you'll want to take the time to perform all the checks in the owner's manual. <I>--Kris Jensen-Van Heste</I>"	COL title VAL "Makita LS1221 12-inch Compound Miter saw Kit" COL feature VAL "Powerful 15.0 AMP motor delivers 4,000 RPM 4-1/2"" tall pivoting fence for cutting up to 5-1/2"" crown molding Positive miter stops at 9 settings: 15, 22.5, 31.6, 45 right or left and 0 (90 cuts) Horizontal D-handle design for easy and comfortable operation Carbide tipped blade for precision cutting Electric brake for maximum productivity Pivoting fence for supporting larger material 40T Carbide Tipped Blade (A-93706) Vertical Vise (122540-9) 2 ea.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

Mom blended the ice cream mixture; Dad filled the maker's wooden tub with ice and rock salt to achieve the below-freezing temperature needed to produce smooth confections; kids clamored to turn the crank; and everyone happily consumed big bowls of ice cream as a reward.

The experience starts with the discussion--often the kids get their pick--of what flavor ice cream your family wants to make. Vanilla with bittersweet chocolate chips or maybe peach made with orchard fresh peaches. Every delicious choice is limited only by your imagination. Just set up your White Mountain ice cream maker with ice and rock salt, and let the fun begin. Whether you&rsquo;re cooling off a hot summer picnic or warming up a homebound winter weekend, the experience is one you can&rsquo;t put a price on. <b><i>Our secret is the triple-motion dasher.</i></b> <br/>At the heart of the White Mountain ice cream maker is a uniquely designed, twin-blade "dasher." The outer canister turns clockwise and the blades turn both clockwise and counter clockwise. That triple-motion action continuously folds the ingredient mixture from the outer walls back onto itself creating the smoothest and creamiest down-home ice cream ever made. </td></tr></table>"	COL title VAL "Deluxe Ceramic Tea Set with Basket" COL feature VAL "This classic tea set helps children practice their social skills, and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor play.

COL title VAL "DEWALT DW618K 2-1/4 HP Electronic Variable Speed Fixed Base Router with So Start Kit" COL feature VAL "2-1/4 horsepower, 12-amp electronic variable-speed motor provides power to rout smoothly through toughest hardwoods Electronic variable speed with full feedback control for constant speed under load from 8,000-24,000 RPM Micro-fine depth adjustment ring provides precise depth adjustments in 1/64-inch increments and adjusts vertically Adjustable, tool-free steel motor cam lock makes depth adjustment and base changes quick and solid-locking Quick release motor latches for fast and easy motor pack removal for bit and base changes" COL description VAL "This fixed-base D-handle router from DeWalt has all the design features to make it a popular choice with woodworkers and professional carpenters for freehand routing. The tool's powerhouse is a smooth-running, 12 amp, 2-1/4-horsepower variable-speed motor with soft start and a spindle lock. It offers more than enough power to make precise, clean cuts in tough hardwood materials without bogging down. A micro-fine adjustment ring is used to dial in the height setting at 1/64-inch increments, so the motor itself doesn't need to be turned, and as a consequence, the position of the switch and cord doesn't change every time your cut-depth does. This same motor can be used with DeWalt's DW6182 plunge base or their DW6184 two-handle fixed base, and DeWalt has thoughtfully made motor removal and base changing a quick and easy, tool-free operation. As finishing touches, the toggle switch on the motor (switched on for operation and overridden by the locking trigger in the D-handle grip) is sealed against dust penetration, and the cord is fully detachable for use with other DeWalt bases and to protect it in storage. DeWalt's engineers and designers clearly spent a lot of time making sure this router package addressed every need a woodworker could have, and the result is a tool that stands with the best in its price range. This model includes a carrying case. <i>--Brian Trinen</i> DEWALT DW618K 2-1/4 HP Electronic Variable Speed Fixed Base Router with So Start Kit"	COL title VAL "GreatNeck APW24 Aluminum Pipe Wrench, 24 Inch" COL feature VAL "Heavy-duty pipe wrenches comply with federal specifications Ridgid covers its products with a lifetime warranty against defects in material This product is made of high quality material Heavy duty professional quality Light weight aluminum reduces fatigue Precision milled moveable jaws GreatNeck limited lifetime warranty Valuable addition to any craftsmen's collection <span>         <a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/sign-in.html?ie=UTF8&ref=&email=&redirectASIN=B0002YUQXU&disableCorpSignUp=&path=%2Fgp%2Fcoupon%2Fc%2APK6CRT5BVH6KFA2KWAJZXU70VKG&redirectProtocol=&mode=&useRedirectOnSuccess=1>Clip this coupon</a> to save 5% on this product when you buy from Amazon.com.                            <span class="a-declarative" data-action="a-modal" data-a-modal="{&quot;width&quot;:&quot;450&quot;,&quot;header&quot;:&quot;Promotion Details&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/gp/promotions/details/popup/APK6CRT5BVH6K&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;600&quot;}">             <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="a-popover-trigger a-declarative">               Here's how             <i class="a-icon a-icon-popover"></i></a>         </span>         (restrictions apply)              </span>" COL description VAL "Heavy Duty Professional Quality, Light Weight Aluminum Reduces Fatigue Precision Milled Moveable Jaws.

Something about this ponderous pond-dweller tells  us he might be an amphibian with an appetite. And not entirely  trustworthy, either.

Maybe it's the sheen of  those bottle-green spines along his back, gleaming with faux water  droplets. (Care for a swim?)

COL title VAL "Seachem Reef Iodide" COL feature VAL "Concentrated and stabilized Restores iodide levels Stabilized" COL description VAL "Reef Iodide is a concentrated (8,000 mg/L) stabilized potassium iodide source for reef aquaria that will restore and maintain iodide levels to those found in natural sea water. It is formulated to provide a safe source of iodide that will not convert to toxic free iodine under storage or reef conditions. Iodine is as toxic as chlorine and should never be used in a reef system. However, iodide is as safe as chloride. Most iodine supplements on the market are simply potassium iodide or a medicinal disinfectant commonly known as Lugols Solution. Lugols is a highly concentrated iodine/iodide solution that is highly toxic and intended for disinfection. Although such products are sold for use in reef aquaria, we believe the risks vastly outweigh the potential minor benefits. Potassium iodide only products are a safer alternative but not very effective alone owing to the unstable nature of iodide in the aquarium environment. When added to an aquarium environment, iodide becomes unstable converting to elemental iodine (which is biocidal), iodate (which is useless to corals, toxic at elevated levels, and can't be tested for), and iodide which is the only form of iodine available to corals for uptake. These products' inherent instability makes them potentially dangerous to coral health.Unlike competing products, Reef Iodide is complexed to a stabilizing compound in order to keep it in the iodide form when added to the aquarium. All of the product remains usable and fully bio-available."

When time is up, an opponent will flip over the card and ask the player a series of questions about the image to see how much they can recall. What was the clown holding in his left hand? What color is the girl's party hat? Guess right and advance on the game board. Kids can play individually or in teams. Great for family game night! The revised Second Edition has larger cards with all new images and questions. Includes image cards, game board, sand timer, playing pieces, die and instructions. Furrowed brows and hearty laughter are the most likely outcome of this fun but challenging game from Game Development Group. Just like its elder edition, the object of Stare! Junior is to be the first to reach the end of the game board. "Been there, done that," you're thinking? But in this game, looking hard and paying attention to detail are two things that will help players move forward. Individuals or teams stare at an image on a card for 30 seconds (more challenging games can be played by shortening the time) and then answer questions about what they saw. It's not easy--just try to remember what color socks the person next to you on the bus was wearing this morning, or how many people were reading magazines. Of course, you weren't staring... <I>--Rachel Radway</I>"	1

It should fit snugly and rest on the bottom of the work bowl. With this versatile cutting disc, you'll create 1/4-inch square strips of potatoes, zucchini, and turnips for deep frying or baking, coarsely chop tomatoes and onions for salsa, make sticks of celery and carrots and other vegetables for salads and crudit&eacute;s, and cut strips of fruits for salads and preserves. The raised shelf behind the cutting blade prevents slices from colliding with the disc itself, providing perfect, uniform strips every time.

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. This set places a lot of useful kitchen cutting edges within reach. The set consists of an 8-inch chef's knife, a 6-inch utility knife, a 5-inch serrated utility knife, a 3-inch paring knife, a pair of multipurpose kitchen shears, and a 9-inch sharpening steel to keep knife edges in order. It all fits in a heavy wood block with four extra slots for future acquisitions or old favorites. Except for the fully forged paring knife, the knives in this set--like other top-grade Henckels knives--are formed by a high-tech welding process that combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics. Traditionalists might insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are stronger than the steel. These knife handles don't have full tangs, but they're made of tough polypropylene. Hand washing is recommended. <i>--Fred Brack</i> <b>Whats in the Box</b><br> 8-inch chef's, 6-inch utility 5-inch serrated utility, and 3-inch paring, shears, 9-inch sharpening steel, storage block with four extra slots " <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines.

Appropriate application materials include copper, aluminum, brass, and plastic. <b>Produces Smooth, Quiet Cuts with Laser-Cut Kerf</b><br>The Freud D1080N's clean-cutting design means that you can enjoy the comfort of smooth performance. The thin 0.094-inch kerf between the blade's 80 TCG (triple-chip grind) teeth is laser cut to provide ease of feed, so you have more control over the blade's position. This helps maximize both the accuracy of the cut and the efficiency of your work, so you enjoy a job well done and the ability to complete more tasks in less time. An added bonus, the blade's laser-cut stabilizer vents reduce noise and vibration during operation, keeping your work environment more relaxed and your hands more in control. This feature also reduces friction and warping, helping to extend the blade's cutting life. <b>Features Shock-Resistant Carbide for Long-Lasting Precision</b><br>So you can count on it over the long term, the Freud D1080N is designed for durability. The blade's hardy teeth are protected by Freud's exclusive shock-resistant TiCo Hi-Density Carbide formula, which helps fight wear and tear and maintains blade sharpness up to four times longer than standard carbide. And protecting the blade is Perma-Shield Non-Stick Coating that provides resistance to heat and corrosion. <b>Fits Miter and Table Saws</b><br>The Freud D1080N is a great addition to your workshop because it's designed with the versatility to fit a variety of table saws and miter saws, including sliding miter saws.

Large, flat handles on the sides facilitate flipping pastry-topped dishes and permit the pan to be carried ceremoniously to the table. A recipe booklet accompanying the pan recounts the tale of Tarte Tatin's accidental invention. The pan is made of cast iron, with both exterior and interior clad in two coats of Le Creuset's famous bright enamel. As cast iron is unexcelled for heat distribution and retention and enamel is impervious to acids and odors, the pan cooks food evenly and gently without hot spots and can be used for marinating. It's also dishwasher-safe. Like all Le Creuset cast-iron cookware, the pan is hand cast in a one-of-a-kind sand mold and hand finished at the Le Creuset factory in France. It carries a lifetime warranty against defects. <i>--Fred Brack</i>"	COL title VAL "Lenox Hancock Fine China 5-Piece Place Setting, Service for 1" COL feature VAL "Includes a 10-5/8-inch dinner plate, an 8-3/8-inch salad/dessert plate, a 6-3/8-inch bread and butter plate, a 5-3/4-inch saucer, and a 6-ounce teacup Beautiful hand-enameling on every piece Ivory fine china with black accents and 24 karat gold bands Safe to use in dishwasher Covered by Lenox's lifetime replacement policy" COL description VAL "Sophisticated, elegant, unmistakably beautiful, the classic Hancock pattern by Lenox brings beauty and dignity to every dining experience in your home.

Now you can play the same beloved nursery school game in a game board version. Move the animated goose around the pond, and make its wings flap up and down. With each splash, the goose calls out "Duck" or "Goose". When you hear "Goose", pick up the adjacent duckling, and see if the color on the bottom matches one of the colors in your nest. The first player to gather three ducklings into his or her nest wins. Press the tail, and everyone gets to hear the song. In this simple game of color matching, players must gather a nest full of similar ducklings to complete a nest. The star of the board is a big hard plastic mother goose who flaps her wings and says mostly "duck" and, once in a while, "goose". On "goose" players must grab for the nearest duckling and see if the color on the bottom matches the color they're collecting. The directions are simple and well explained, which should endear the game to young players to whom board games can often be overwhelming and frustrating. But the little ducklings are made of cardboard making us worry how likely they are to endure the punishment dished out by young players. But if the set can be kept in tact, this makes for a fun and simple introduction to game playing. <i>--Charlie Williams</i>"	0

This meticulous approach resulted in a premium-quality product that is a firm favourite amongst both coffee lovers and professional chefs. <br><br> The materials and components used to manufacture the aerolatte frothers are crucial in ensuring the exceptional performance and longevity for which they are renowned. <br><br> Motor <br> All aerolatte frothers contain a motor that operates at a dry rotation speed and torque that is specific to the function of foaming milk. If a motor spins either too slowly or too quickly, the quality of the froth will be compromised. An incorrect level of torque will result in excessive demand being placed upon the motor, increasing the likelihood of premature failure. <br><br> Shaft and Spiral Whisking Head <br> Both components are made from food-approved 18/8 stainless steel. The steel used for the shaft is hardened and thickened in order to protect against bending and to increase robustness. The spiral whisking head is cut from a purpose-produced spring. The density and tightness of the coils promote effective frothing. <br><br> Handle <br> The aerolatte handles are made from moulded virgin ABS plastic. The material ensures durability and the correct adhesion factor for subsequent electroplating. <br><br> Once moulded, the handle of the chrome and satin versions is electroplated separately in both brass and chrome. The satin model is then also dipped into liquid aluminium. The finishes are polished in order to produce a handle that will not diminish over time and boasts the true cold feel of metal. <br><br> Screws and Contacts <br> The screws are made from rust-proof stainless steel that is resistant to the damp environment of the kitchen.

The batteries have the same specification as other premium-quality alkaline brands and are mercury and cadmium-free. The batteries should be replaced when the motor noticeably slows and the shaft begins to wobble (after approximately 150 uses). Any equivalent alkaline batteries will be suitable.<br><br> Uses - for Milk and Beyond! <br> Although primarily designed for whisking milk - and ideal for concocting a wide variety of hot and cold drinks - aerolatte frothers can also be used to prepare food. They are perfect for creating sauces such as vinaigrette and hollandaise in a small jug, as well as tempting desserts such as zabaglione. They can be used to make gravy and soup in a small bowl and to whisk egg whites and mixtures in order to produce mayonnaise, omelettes, custard, meringues etc. <br><br> Cleaning <br> After usage, your aerolatte frother can be easily cleaned by rinsing the whisking head and shaft under the tap/faucet. Periodically the unit should be operated in hot, soapy water in order to maintain performance. Simply switch the device on for several seconds in order to dry. <br><br> The handle can be cleaned by wiping it with a damp cloth.

The router's electronic variable-speed trigger lets you select from between 8,000 and 24,000 rpm for specific applications. And because this system employs full electronic feedback, you can trust the router to provide constant speed under load. In addition, the motor's soft start reduces start-up torque for optimum control. The router's fixed base features a micro-fine depth-adjustment ring that provides precise bit adjustments in 1/64-inch increments. Because the ring--not the motor can--turns to adjust bit depth, a constant switch/cordset location is maintained when you are using the router in a table. This minimizes difficulty in turning the unit on and off and keeps operation consistent. The plunge base features an adjustable five-position turret stop for use when making repeated plunge cuts. The easy-to-reach plunge-release lever and switch keep control at your fingertips during routing. <b>Quick, Secure Base and Bit Changes</b><br>The clear, LEXAN sub-base offers optimum bit visibility and base durability, and it accepts standard template-guide bushings to make application-specific setups easy. Also, a sub-base concentricity gauge is included. If you insert this into the collet prior to bit installation, it will help you center the sub-base relative to bit location when making your cut line off of the side of the base. Moreover, the sub-base and other included bases are designed to make both base and bit changes easy. Quick-release motor latches allow for fast and easy motor-pack removal, while a spindle-lock button allows for single-wrench bit changes. The fixed base also offers a flat top, so the router can be set upside down for easy bit and depth changes. Additionally, long, self-releasing, eight-slotted collets provide improved bit retention and prevent bits from jamming. <b>Built for Consistency and Durability</b><br>Routing applications produce a lot of dust, which can result in extra wear and tear on electronic parts. That's why this system features a dust-sealed switch that protects against dust ingestion for longer tool life. Other components that contribute to the tool's overall consistency and durability include heavy-duty metal housings, precision-machined brass bushings, and case-hardened steel guide rods on the plunge base. <b>Comfortable Operation with Integrated Dust Control</b><br>Each base features comfortable rubber over-molded handles and a low center of gravity for improved balance and control and reduced user fatigue. The base also has a patented through-the-column dust-collection system. This allows a vacuum to be attached to the router without blocking your line of sight. In addition, this router kit offers you the ability to work with the switch and cordset on either your left or right side. Also contributing to this setup's usability is a detachable cordset that can be easily serviced. A shorty cord motor pack is not required if you opt to place the motor can in a D-Handle base. The DW618PK DEWALT 2-1/4-Inch EVS Fixed Base/ Plunge Base Router Combo Kit with Soft Start is backed by a three-year limited warranty. <b>What's in the Box</b><br>DW618M motor pack, DW6184 fixed base, DW6182 plunge base, 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch collets, wrench, sub-base concentricity gauge, large-hole sub-base, vacuum adapter, and kit box. <br clear="all"><table cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="481" align="center"><tr align="center"><td><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/content_26/Q4_2010/c26-B00006JKXE-4.jpg" border="0" alt="DEWALT 2-1/4-Inch Fixed-Base/Plunge-Base Router Combo Kit"><br><font size="1"><em><b>Everything stays safe and secure in the durable kit box. </b></em></font></td></tr></table><br clear="all">"	0

The brand was designated for imperial use in the Qing Dynasty court and got a special award from Emperor Qianlong. The crafting of these scissors require processes that evolved over three centuries: high-quality steel is set into wrought iron which is then forged and hammered into cutting edges. Next the edges are finely ground with mineral rich mud bricks from the area. You'll find the action to be smooth and sure. The company has received awards for excellence at the Southern Coast Industrial Exposition in 1910, the 1915 Panama Pacific Imitational Exposition and the 1926 Expo in Philadelphia.

Includes game board with spinner, 100 plastic coins, play bills, markers, and dice. 2-4 players. What a fun way to learn about combining coins! The object of this colorful and compact board game is to earn money while winding along a cartoon path. Money is earned by landing on a square labeled with a practical chore, such as setting the table (31 cents), or an entrepreneurial endeavor, such as a lemonade stand (15 cents). In order to collect money, the spinner is used to determine which coins can or cannot be taken from the bank. If the spinner lands on "no nickels" then you collect your change with any coins except for nickels. There's an additional incentive to use critical thinking and coin combining skills. Extra money can be earned if you land on a "Bank Exchange" space and exchange your coins (for example, two nickels for a dime). As you may have suspected, the player with the most money at the end wins. <i>--Lauren Bernard</i> What a fun way to learn about combining coins!

After all, how undercover can you ever really be if it's easy to identify you the first time you talk? Thanks to this spy voice scrambler, however, an anonymous spy could vocally stay that way. Fitting neatly in the palm of your hand, it sports options for recording, playback, and a special "voice twister" meant to distort the sound. All three functions worked nicely in our informal test.

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 5-1/2-inch hand-honed blade on this knife features a sharp curve near the bolster and a straight cutting edge. The blade is slim, narrow, and flexible for ease in removing bones, particularly from chicken and other poultry. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell</i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines. Four Star knives were designed and developed in close cooperation with renowned professional chefs. The result was a fully forged knife with a unique molded handle. The Four Star line contains knives for all tasks, and includes the following open stock knife types: parer, bread, peeling, sandwich, utility, carving, chefs, granton edge slicer, santoku, and others. Four Star knives are also available in a range of block sets and gift sets. <td> </tr> </table> <P> <B>A Higher Standard in Knife Construction</B><P> Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of exclusive-formula, high-carbon, no-stain steel under the all-new Sigmaforge standard. As a result, Four Star knives have improved quality consistency, lasting sharpness, and perfect geometry. Sigmaforge one-piece construction also provides high precision and improved stability of the blade and steel structure, thus improving cutting-edge retention for lasting sharpness. In addition, Four Star knives use J.A. Henckels Friodur ice hardening for corrosion resistance, a process that also contributes to cutting-edge retention. <P> <center> <img src=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-twinselect-forging.jpg align="center"></center> <p clear=left> <B>It's All in The Grip:</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar-handle.jpg </td> <td> The Four Star series features high impact polypropylene handles that are permanently bonded to the knife blades without any gaps.

Classic three-rivet handles distinguish Pro S from the company's other quality lines: TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Pro S handles are heavier and its knives less weight-forward. The Pro S line also has handles that are smaller; however, the line's steel is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines. High-tech welding of larger knives combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so this knife's parts have distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "ZWILLING J.A.

This system works to make the sanding pad rotate and orbit gradually as pressure is applied to the work surface. Aside from being a mouthful, this system is supposed to help materials achieve a "swirl-free finish"--and it does. Several orbital sander manufacturers are promising a swirl-free finish from their sanders, but Bosch comes the closest to meeting that promise. The 3727 adjusts from 4,500 to 12,000 opm (orbits per minute), with a variable-speed dial that's convenient to adjust but positioned to prevent accidental speed changes. In testing, we found this to be an exceptionally stable sander that never felt wobbly, even at full speed. This is a performance feature that should make the Bosch especially appealing to solid-surface finishers and Coreon-top installers. And, as with all of the new Bosch tools we've tested, this sander is comfortable to use. Front and rear handles are ergonomic and seem to fit naturally to the hands. The tool runs quietly and without much vibration, all of which means less user fatigue--an important consideration for production sanding applications. Although we didn't get to crank up the 3727 on any really large jobs, we definitely got the feeling it could cover a lot of ground. This Bosch is designed with pro use in mind, and that's reflected in the price. Although it's one of the most expensive sanders in the class, pros and do-it-yourselfers alike will find that extra money well spent. <i>--Mark McDonald</i> The Bosch 3727DVS dustless random sander offers an orbit-plus-rotation feature, which duplicates natural hand-sanding action for smooth operation and a swirl-free finish. The dual-bearing pad mount system eliminates wobble. The variable-speed dial (4,500 to 12,000 orbits per minute) provides superior control, and the ergonomic handle allows for a comfortable grip. It utilizes quick-change hook-and-loop paper and efficiently collects dust with its through-the-pad bag or optional vacuum accessories.

With the flip of a lever, the sanding mode can be easily changed. The desired speed is set using a speed dial and Constant Response circuitry maintains the desired speed under load. The 1250DEVS comes with a Bosch microcellular hook-&-loop sanding pad. These soft pads deliver finer, smoother, flatter surface finishes, due to their ability to conform to the surface of the workpiece and due to the elastic support of the pads plastic inlays. (Bosch also offers two other optional microcellular pad accessories, an extra-soft pad for use in fine finishing and for use on more-contoured workpieces, and a hard pad for fastest stock removal of flat surfaces. User comfort has been addressed on the 1250DEVS in its PowerGrip, contoured head, compact 7.7 In.-diameter circumference barrel, and standard-equipment auxiliary handle. The Bosch 1250DEVS features a passive dust collection system, which maximizes its efficiency when used with a vacuum-based dust collection system. Large channels in the pads allow debris to be easily pulled through vacuum port. Bosch internal testing determined that the 1250DEVS captured an impressive 96 percent of material removed. The dust port is sized for the optional Bosch vac hoses, and an adapter is included for attachment to 1-1/4 In. and 1-1/2 In. hoses. Other Bosch accessories that can be used with the 1250DEVS turbo sander are Bosch 6 In. sanding discs and as buffing and sponge applicator pads. The 1250DEVS is built to last, with durability features that include a rugged aluminum gear housing, bearings and gears and switch that are sealed against dust, including solid surface material. <b>About Bosch Random Orbit Sanders</b><BR> In Bosch's random orbit sander family, you'll find an assortment of powerful, versatile sanders and polishers that are designed for low vibration and minimal noise.

This model is crammed with great convenience and power features, including a soft start function that tones down the start-up torque and a variable speed dial that makes it extra easy to match your working speed to the project. It also has Constant Response circuitry that maintains the pad speed under heavy loads while simultaneously protecting against overloads, and an integral pad dampening system to help prevent swirl marks -- plus a passive dust collection system (vacuum and hoses required, available by Bosch). The 1250DEVS uses 6-hole, 6-inch hook-and-loop discs. This kit includes a dust tube, soft backing pad, a left or right-hand auxiliary handle, one sanding disc, and a pad wrench (5mm) that stores on-board. <b>Applications</b><BR> The 1250DEVS removes stock and finishing material quickly, without scratching -- making it perfect for most sanding jobs, from wood floors to furniture finishing.

This compact, one-blade mowing/mulching system mows on its own within a boundary that you outline with a thin wire (included). Once you handle the initial wire setup, all you have to do is schedule a program, sit back, relax, and mow! The Robomow RM400 will depart from its Base Station on your chosen days and times, and over the course of a three-day period (of three consecutive mowing sessions), it will mow up to 4,500 square feet. When it's done mowing, the Robomow RM400 will return to the Base Station for charging until the next scheduled operation. With this mower, you can be your lawn will be maintained, even when you're busy or away from home. <b>Wallet-Friendly Choice</b><br>Unlike conventional lawn mowers that pollute as much as 40 late-model cars in just one hour of use, Robomow RM400 offers a way to keep your lawn looking great without sacrificing the environment. The Robomow RM400 doesn't simply cut your grass--it repurposes the clippings through a patented process called grasscycling. The mower cuts grass into fine clippings and disperses the cuttings over the ground. These clippings quickly decompose and release valuable nutrients and water into the soil, resulting in a better-looking lawn. Grasscycling also leads to a deeper, healthier root system that increases your lawn's resistance to disease, drought, and insects, and it reduces the amount of water your lawn needs by as much as 85&#37;. And because Robomow RM400 doesn't require gas, oil, tune-ups, or spark plugs, it will save you money. <b>Safe, Powerful Operation on Any Lawn</b><br>In addition to its environmental benefits, the Robomow RM400's blade spins at a speed of 5,800 RPM and offers a mow height of 0.80-3.15 inches. It also has knobby wheels that tackle high grass and sloping or bumpy ground, and it boasts a range of features for safe, efficient operation. Specifically, user-controlled theft protection, including an alarm system, protects against unauthorized use of the unit, while a tilt sensor stops the blade from rotating when the unit is tilted. To help guard against the elements, the Robomow RM400 is both UV protected and weatherproof. For an extra measure of assurance, it's also equipped with a rain sensor. If it starts raining when the unit is mowing, the RM400 will immediately return to its docking station. For added convenience, the Robomow RM400 comes with a perimeter switch that automatically activates the area to be mowed, and a remote control for easy transport of the mower from the garage to the lawn and between plots. The remote is also great for manually mowing very narrow areas. <b>Dimensions and Warranty Information</b><br>The Robomow RM400 measures 20.5 x 12.0 x 25.0 inches (WxHxD) and weighs just 39 pounds. It is backed by a two-year warranty on the unit and a one-year warranty on the battery. <b>What's in the Box</b><br>Robomow RM400; perimeter wire and pegs; two maintenance-free 12-AH sealed lead acid batteries and charge pack; and instruction manual. <br clear="all"> Robomow RM400 is an automatic lawnmower that cuts the grass all by itself. It comes with a base station and it will depart at the pre-set scheduled days and times. At the end of each operation Robomow returns to the base station for charging until the next scheduled operation. Your lawn will be maintained even when you are away from home. The RM400 is the new generation of Robomow to be introduced for 2008. It is designed to handle lawns with total mowed area of up to 4500 square feet  to be handled over a three days period of three consecutive mowing sessions. The RM400 includes a docking system and station for true automation. Simply set a weekly program for the days and times you want the lawn mowed and the RM400 will do it automatically for you, day after day and week after week. Truly the most efficient way to keep your lawn maintained. This unit is also equipped with a rain sensor. The rain sensor will prevent the RM400 from coming out of its docking station and mowing if it is raining. Also, if it starts raining when the unit is mowing, the RM400 will return to the docking station. The RM400 is light enough to be lifted and carried. However, a remote control is offered as an accessory, which allows driving between the plots and manual mowing for small, non wired areas. A perimeter switch is offered as an accessory as well, for activating non docking areas."	0

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for 19th-century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. The company even fabricated and erected a series of IBM "tent cities" just outside Binghamton, housing thousands of IBM salesmen during the company's annual stockholders meeting, which had outgrown its previous locale. With the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, renowned explorer Sir Edmund Hillary used Eureka's new and innovative Draw-Tite tent--with its practical, freestanding external frame--in a Himalayan expedition to Nepal (Hillary had climbed to the summit of Mt. Everest only six years earlier). In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants during the first all-American Mt. Everest Expedition, where explorers braved fierce 60-plus mph winds and temperatures reached below -20F. Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s, targeting it to backpackers and families. The first to employ the StormShield design, the lightweight, self-supporting backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents in the industry, with sales reaching over 1 million by its 10-year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as companions on other historic expeditions, including the American Women's Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. "	0

As the benefits of these lightweight, portable, and relatively inexpensive tools became more widely known, their use crossed over into the fitness arena, where they quickly became popular for core conditioning and full-body training. SPRI was instrumental in helping elevate stability balls within the club/instructor market. Through working with some of the leading industry educators, SPRI had the opportunity to really listen to instructors, learn how stability balls were being used, and develop ways to improve them  without compromising on quality. SPRI then went on to become one of the first to offer a true slow-deflate stability ball. This ensures maximum safety while sitting, lying, kneeling, or lifting light weights on the ball. SPRI works closely with its trusted manufacturing partner to make sure that all SPRI stability balls are durable, are free of harmful phthalates, maintain their shape and feel, and provide a safe, slip-resistant texture. Specialized stability balls are now available for every exercise level  for beginners and mid-level participants in semi-controlled environments, all the way up to the most advanced exercisers and the most demanding applications."

The strength comes from the ice hardening process that reaches a Rockwell degree of C-56-58. A straight edge gives this knife a perfect way to cut delicate fruit like strawberries or grapes to make wonderful designs while having complete control of the knife.

Overall Width - Side to Side: -2.2". Overall Depth - Front to Back: -0.7". Overall Product Weight: -0.2 lbs. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global's original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives, Global also makes a European-style "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty cutlery--like this 3-inch paring knife for cleaning and peeling vegetables and fruits. Global also dispensed with bolsters on most of its knives, including this one. Most Global knives have hollow handles, but the handle on this knife is solid. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a sharpening guide rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

Can you claim the Iron Throne? Designed for ages 14 and up, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second Edition is a classic game of warfare, diplomacy, and intrigue for three to six players. Taking control of the well-known characters from George R.R. Martin's beloved fantasy series, players must fight for dominance of the realm. Will you take power through force, coerce your way onto the throne with persuasive speeches, or rally the townsfolk to your side? With opportunities for strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, this game gives you a host of ways to spread your influence over Westeros. Based on the bestselling fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin (now a hit HBO series), A Game of Thrones: The Board Game draws players into a war-torn world of sun-scorched sands, lush forests, and chilling northlands. Each player takes control of one of six Great Houses of Westeros, then sets out on an epic campaign of combat and politics to secure total dominance. This board game includes clear, detailed rules to guide you through setup and gameplay. Play begins when each person receives an army of footmen, knights, siege engines and ship units as well as a set of order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique house cards, which represent important characters from <span style="font-style:italic;">A Song of Ice and Fire</span> and are used as leaders in battles against rival houses. A Game of Thrones: The Board Game captures the most memorable elements of George R.R. Martin's popular series. The detailed board represents an accurate map of Westeros, and the tokens and cards convey many of its most significant locations and characters. Attractive marbled plastic figures shaped as footmen, knights, ships, and siege engines display your military might to the realm while contributing to the game's overall medieval aesthetic. Game play proceeds over the course of ten rounds, after which the player who has claimed the most areas containing castles or strongholds is declared the winner. If at any time throughout the game a player controls seven such areas, that player may immediately claim victory. Fragile alliances will form and break over the course of each game, as players promise support to neighboring Houses only to betray them for their own selfish ends. But beware; as the war unfolds, the barbaric Wildings (which are controlled automatically by the game) work to amass their forces in the far north. Players must occasionally set aside their differences to face a common foe--or face the consequences together. A Game of Thrones: The Board Game draws you into a vibrant gaming world, bringing your favorite characters to life. The board resembles paint on distressed parchment for an old-world look, while the token and card art exhibits intricate detailing fans of the novels will recognize and enjoy. Game board, rule book, 138 plastic units, 105 cards, 6 player screens, and 266 tokens and overlays."	1

Figure Measures Approximately 4 Inches Tall. Ages 4 and up. Includes: Bowcaster Rifle & Episode 1 Flashback Photo Card. From Hasbro.  Chewbacca, like all members of the Wookiee species, was indigenous to the jungle planet of Kashyyyk. Honorable, intelligent, and friendly, though fierce and dangerous when angered, Wookiees were a proud species who once made contributions to the Galactic Republic. Wookiee senators represented Kashyyyk in the Galactic Senate. Their respectable position changed, however, when the Imperials seized power and began enslaving the extraordinarily strong Wookiees as laborers. In Chewbacca's case, he escaped slavery and death with the help of a young officer by the name of Han Solo, who destroyed his military career to save the innocent Wookiee. A life debt was established, and Chewbacca joined Han in his adventures through the galaxy. Later on, the duo played significant roles in the Rebel victory over the Empire, and the Wookiee species was restored to its position of honor in the galaxy. In <i>Star Wars</i>, Hoth Chewbacca the Wookie was Han Solo's dependable copilot and sidekick. Once respected citizens of the Galactic Republic, the strong and intelligent Wookies had been enslaved by the Imperials. The Chewbacca action figure is 4.25 inches tall and rotates at the waist, hips, shoulders, and (slightly) at the neck. Chewbacca's weapon of choice--a bowcaster rifle--fits into his right hand. In the accompanying "flashback photo," the image flashes from a scraggly-looking Hoth Chewbacca to a much sleeker Wookie senator. <i>--Louise Carter</i>"	COL title VAL "Ty Beanies Babies - Pinky" COL feature VAL "Soft, Cuddly And Fun!

Measures 3/8" with a 3.7A and 0-1,200 RPM. A remarkably compact tool, DeWalt's 3/8-inch, 3.2 amp right-angle drill is designed for electricians, plumbers, remodelers, and anyone else who works in tight places. The drill offers good speed (1,200 rpm) and weighs 3-3/4 pounds. The tool's most distinguishing feature is its paddle-type trigger, which runs nearly the length of the tool's body, allowing the user to engage the drill using all manner of inventive hand configurations. The molded neck makes the drill comfortable to grasp by the head, as well. The paddle trigger, however, does make it possible to engage the drill unintentionally while you're maneuvering or when you set the tool down. In order to make this drill so compact, DeWalt had to make a few design compromises. The tool has a keyed chuck; a keyless chuck, when you think about it, makes the drill's nose significantly longer. The drill also doesn't reverse, and depending on the materials you'll be drilling through, this is something to consider before you buy. But for anyone looking for an extremely compact drill that's built to last, this DeWalt is a smart buy. A key and a rubber key holder complete the package. <I>--Jon Groebner</I>"	COL title VAL "Makita DA3010F 4 Amp 3/8-Inch Right Angle Drill with LED Light" COL feature VAL "Powerful 4.0 AMP motor with less weight (3.5 lbs.)

COL title VAL "Othello" COL feature VAL "This classic game of strategy takes a minute to learn, a lifetime to master It's simple enough for children yet challenging for adults Great fun for the entire family For all generations Includes 64 reversible discs, one playing board, six playing board feet and instructions" COL description VAL "This internationally acclaimed game takes a minute to learn and a lifetime to master. "Othello is a game where not all is Black and White. The lead can change hands from play to play and strategy is everything. Play is simple. Players are represented by either Black or White discs on the board. On each turn, players flank the discs of the opposing player between two of their own. Once captured, the double-sided discs are turned over and become the opposite color. If you have a move, you have to take it whether you want to or not. That&#8217;s all, that&#8217;s the entire game. But more and more discs fall to the opposing side with each turn. Where will it all end? Starting from just four discs to begin the game, play moves all over the board with as many as 64 discs placed by the final move. Play can end when one player can&#8217;t make any more moves OR when the board is full. To add to the fun, if you can make a move but you&#8217;re out of discs, your opponent has to give you one of theirs. That&#8217;s like arming the enemy! As you become more and more familiar with Othello, certain strategies will begin to emerge. Owning a corner is always an advantage as that protects your discs in the immediate vicinity - your opponent can&#8217;t outflank you. But is your opponent backing you towards a corner so they can try to control it themselves? That&#8217;s the strategy of Othello. Can you see enough moves ahead to make your opponent put a disc somewhere they don&#8217;t want to? A minute to learn&#8230;a lifetime to master!""	0

A pH of 7.0 is ideal when keeping a community aquarium containing a variety of tropical fish. Goldfish and livebearers prefer a pH of 7.5.

That iMAgiNiff was developed by two brothers (in Australia) makes perfect sense, because this is a board game you'll want to share with family and friends. It's simple to play. A set of names is chosen, usually the name of every player plus those of several absent friends. When it's your turn, one name is selected as the subject of the question. You pick a card--one of hundreds--that poses a question and six possible answers (for example, "Imaginiff _____ were a crime. Which would he/she be?"). Read the question aloud, plugging in the subject's name. Then read out the six answers (in this case, they range from "homicide" to "indecent exposure"). Each player picks an answer to fit the subject; those who have picked the most popular answer move forward. But though you win by advancing, winning is obviously not the point: laughter and arguments are. The questions on the cards range from the ridiculous ("Imaginiff _____ were a body part.") to the provocative ("Imaginiff _____ had to decide which of the following values is most important."). The game is a fun cross between Scruples and True Colors. <i>--Elisa Murray</i>"	0

Not only does this sleek, highly-polished wine chiller from Namb look modern and sophisticated with its angled top, it really does keep wine chilled. The heavy, thick metal is excellent at retaining cold (or heat, if necessary), and can be placed in the freezer or fridge before use to get thoroughly cold. The oven-safe, durable metal will not crack, chip, or tarnish, but may not be used in a microwave or cleaned in a dishwasher. The wine chiller measures seven inches in height. Namb was founded in 1951 in a village of the same name in scenic northern New Mexico. From the beginning, the company focused on hand-producing high-quality, functional items such as metal bowls and trays with great attention to timeless, modern design. Still made in the USA, Namb's signature metal alloy is liquified, poured into a hand-made sand cast, and the resulting piece repeatedly polished and smoothed by hand. Exceptional gifts for the most special of occasions, Namb metal bowls and accessories are now joined by porcelain and crystal pieces, each flawlessly crafted. Namb ware has won numerous design awards, has been shown in or recognized by nearly two dozen museums worldwide, and is part of the permanent collections of many, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>"	COL title VAL "J.K.

Once complete, you set the wheels in motion, as it were, to try to capture the opposition's mice. But this is no ordinary trap. With this contraption you start by turning the crank, that rotates the gears, that push the lever, that moves the shoe, that kicks the bucket, that sends the ball down the stairs and into the gutter, that leads to the rod that releases a second ball, that falls through the bathtub and onto the springboard, that catapults the diver into the washtub, that causes the cage to fall and--whew!--hopefully, capture a mouse.

Besides Eden, a service inspired by nature, he is also the designer behind such collections as Corona, Odyssey, Neptunus, and the heart-shaped Amour and My Heart. Nature clearly inspires his art glass, too, including many grand pieces well suited to public spaces. His glass is characteristically massive and forceful, whether it be cast, mold-blown, or free-blown. He celebrated his 70th birthday and more than 30 years at Orrefors with a large retrospective exhibition at the Orrefors Exhibition Hall between May and September, 2003. <td> </tr> </table> <B> About the Kosta Boda:</B><P> With characteristic craftsmanship and good design, Kosta Boda has become one of the leading glasshouses in the world. The company's three glassworks in the villages of Kosta, Boda, and fors each have exciting individual stories of their own yet stand together under the common brand name Kosta Boda. The corps of designers currently on retainer at Kosta Boda works with both utilitarian and art glass. Glass results from a great many meetings between people--artists, craftspeople, and lovers of glass. The artists of Kosta Boda have a decisive role to play in all the creative stages of the process. The cooperation between the designers and the skilled craftspeople is very close; indeed, it is essential if the designers are to transfer their intentions to the glass. <B> The History of Kosta Boda:</B><P> Kosta, the parent glassworks of Kosta Boda and the oldest glassworks in Sweden still in operation, has a fascinating history that forms a valuable part of Swedish cultural heritage. The glassworks was founded in 1742 by the governors of the counties of Kronoberg and Kalmar, Anders Koskull and Georg Bogislaus Stael von Holstein, both former generals in the army of Karl XII and distinguished veterans of the battle of Narva, among others. The two county governors founded the glassworks upon the instructions of Fredrik I and modeled it on Continental glassworks. The works was situated deep in the spruce forests of Smland, on a site midway between the two country towns, and near a village that was then known as Dfvedshult. The main reason for choosing this location was the unlimited availability of wood. Enormous quantities of wood were naturally required to keep the glassmaking furnaces burning day and night. <td><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/kostaboda/kosta-boda-logo.gif" align="right"></td> <P> Both of the founders wanted their names to be remembered, so the works was christened Kosta, from the initial letters--Ko and Sta--of the surnames of both the Carolinian generals. After a time the entire community was renamed after the growing glassworks. <P> During the first 150 years, the glassworks in Kosta produced only utility glass, including window glass for the building of Tessin's Royal Palace, bottles and glass for the royal household, and chandeliers for churches. The first glassblowers were immigrant glass masters from Bhmen. They became the founding fathers of the glassblowing families, which passed down craft skills from generation to generation. Swedish sand was used to manufacture crystal glass, but nowadays pure silica sand is imported from Belgium, since the Swedish sand contains iron oxide that gives the glass a green tinge. <P> Under the management of glass masters from Kosta, a succession of glassworks sprang up in the forests of Smland in the regions around Vxj and Kalmar. Kosta therefore has good reason to call itself the parent works of the entire Swedish Kingdom of Crystal. <td><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/kostaboda/kosta-boda-factory-historic.gif" align="left"></td> <P> Until the end of the 19th century, the glass from Kosta was designed by the glassblowers themselves. At the Stockholm exhibition in 1897, the glassworks was criticized for the uniformity of its glass, which led to the idea of enlisting designers and artists in production. The first designer to be employed by Kosta was Gunnar Wennerberg. The year was 1898. Ever since then a large number of artists and designers have enriched the glassmaking tradition of the works with their artistic talents. Today Kosta Boda has a unique right to describe itself as an art industry, in which designers and craftspeople work closely together in the ongoing development of handmade utility glass and art glass. This diversity of individual artistic expression and the free and uninhibited creative process have become the distinguishing characteristics of the Kosta Boda brand. <P> In addition to the parent works in Kosta, Kosta Boda today includes the two "daughter works" of Boda (founded in 1864) and fors (founded in 1876), a partnership that was formed in 1964. Both Boda and fors were originally relatively simple glassworks that manufactured utility glass. Boda experienced a period of glory in the 1960s and 1970s, under the innovative and dynamic artistic leadership of Erik Hglund, a heritage carried on by Kjell Engman and Monica Backstrm. fors has been the home of the designer couple Ulrica Hydman-Vallien and Bertil Vallien, who, together with Gunnel Sahlin and Olle Brozn, brought a renaissance to the small glassworks and local community. In 1990 Kosta was acquired by its former competitor Orrefors. Orrefors/Kosta Boda was in turn acquired by the Danish company Royal Copenhagen in 1997, and the design group Royal Scandinavia was formed. The group also includes Georg Jensen, Royal Copenhagen, and Holmegaard. <P> Colorful, handmade art glass from the works in Kosta, Boda, and fors have made Kosta Boda one of Sweden's strongest brands and one of the world's leading glass companies. Glass from Kosta Boda is sold all over the world. Roughly 50 percent of production is sold outside Scandinavia, with some of the biggest markets in the U.S., Japan, Germany, and Australia. The origins of this glass, the living tradition of craftsmanship developed in the glassworks in Kosta, Boda, and fors, is a heritage that every Swede has a right to feel proud of. <P> <B> Taking Care of Kosta Boda Pieces:</B><P> Handmade and hand-painted glass (especially the latter) does not do well in the dishwasher. Wash by hand in hot water--though not too hot--with a little washing-up liquid. Washing in very hot water will eventually destroy the luster of the glass. Rinse in water of about the same temperature as you washed it in. To avoid cracking the glass, make sure you do not expose it to excessive temperature differences. To avoid lines, dry with a soft cloth that won't shed lint. The edge of the glass is its most fragile part. When you put the glass back in the cupboard, stand it on its foot and make sure the edge does not come into contact with other glasses or objects. <P> <B> The Mark or Signature on Kosta Boda Pieces:</B><P> Products are marked with the words <i>Kosta Boda</i>, the name of the artist, and the article number (seven digits). Painted pieces are signed with a painted signature with the designer's and the painter's initials. Engraved pieces also have the engraver's signature near the designer's name. <P> Besides designing glass for the regular Kosta Boda collection, our artists are also free to work with art glass--limited-edition, specially signed pieces that are often much sought after by collectors. Kosta Boda art glass is divided into two categories: unique pieces and limited editions. Unique pieces are, of course, just that. No more than one piece is made of any particular item. Limited editions are manufactured in runs of between 25 and 1,000 pieces. All art glass is marked with the product number, the name of the artist, and the size of the edition so that the purchaser will know exactly how many pieces there are in that particular series. Editions comprising less than 60 pieces are individually numbered, e.g. "25/60.""	0

The unit not only easily accommodates larger ingredients, but its functional profile also maximizes convenient side-by-side space on the stovetop. Made of heavy-duty cast iron, the cookware's colorful, long-lasting exterior enamel resists chipping and cracking, while its durable, nonreactive sand-colored interior enamel offers a smooth surface for cooking and an optimal palette for food presentation. As cast iron is unexcelled for even heat distribution and superior heat retention, and enamel is impervious to acids and odors, the oven browns and cooks food uniformly and gently without hot spots and can be used for marinating, cooking on the stovetop, or finishing in the oven. Two loop cast-iron side handles help ensure a steady grip during transport--even when wearing bulky oven mitts, and the unit's secure-fitting lid locks in heat and moisture while cooking. The lid also comes fitted with a black phenolic knob that's oven-safe up to 350 degrees F. Beautiful enough for the table yet durable enough to outlive its lifetime limited warranty, the French oven can be safely used on any stovetop, including induction, and should be hand washed for best results. Beautiful enough to bring to the table, yet durable enough to  outlive its 101-year warranty against defects, this heavy casserole is  perfect for preparing and ceremoniously serving dishes such as  choucroute garni and braised lamb shanks. The oval shape handles big  cuts of meat and big birds. Use it in the oven or on the stovetop for  soups and chili. Made of cast-iron, which is unexcelled for its heat  distribution and retention, this French oven cooks foods evenly and  gently without hot spots at low temperatures and is suitable for all  heat sources. This pan holds 5 quarts and its exterior and interior  are clad in two coats of Le Creuset's famous enamel. The plastic  knob on its heavy, tight-fitting lid is ovenproof to 450 degrees F.  Loop handles facilitate carrying, and the casserole is dishwasher-safe.  Like all Le Creuset cast-iron products, it is hand-cast in a  one-of-a-kind sand mold and hand-finished at the Le Creuset factory in  France. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Philippe Richard 16 Piece Stainless Steel 18/10 Cookware Set-Professional" COL feature VAL "All handles are riveted to the bodies for strength and durability.

Made In China" COL description VAL "16PC. Stainless Steel 18/10 Cookware Set-Professional-Philippe Richard Use and Care Instructions are as follows: Before First Use: Wash pan in warm soapy water. 'Season' Pan with a small amount of cooking oil. Wipe off any excess oil. Oven Cooking: Non-Stick Cookware is oven safe to 350F. Do not use under the boiler as it may cause damage to the non-stick coating. Always use oven mittsor pot holders when removing pots or pans from the oven as the handles will also get hot. Glass lid is not recommended for oven use above 270F. Cooking Utensils: Tabletops Unlimited Inc. uses non-stick coating on the interiors of the cookware. Though this is a premium coating and is very durable, we do not recommend using metal utensils to mix, stir or release food from our pans. Wood, plastic or nylon tools are preferred. Do not use under the broiler as it may cause damage to the non-stick coating. Cleaning: Clean-up is as simple as using a sponge and warm soapy water, or cookware is also dishwasher safe. Do not use abrasive cleaning pads. Including a comprehensive cookware collection and an inclusive set of kitchen tools, this 16-piece ensemble from Philippe Richard establishes a strong foundation for any first time kitchen owner. Attractive and durable, the pans feature 18/10 stainless-steel construction with securely riveted handles and snuggly fitting, tempered glass lids. Thanks to an encapsulated aluminum disk in the base of each vessel, heat distributes quickly and evenly allowing for the prevention of unwanted hot spots. Generously sized loop handles and finger indentations along their straighter counterparts provide comfort during use. On the downside, the steel handle material retains heat and as a result requires the use of a cloth or potholder. While the glass lid construction affords the convenience of food monitoring, its disadvantage lies in the limited ability to withstand oven temperatures above 270 degrees F. The cookware set consists of an 8-inch omelet pan and 10-inch skillet for frying and sauting; a 2-quart saucepan and 3-quart casserole pan with lids for cooking pasta and steaming vegetables; and a generous 6-quart Dutch oven with lid for making hearty stews or cooking a cluster of full-cob corn. Each item in the utensil collection features durable nylon construction for safe use with nonstick pans and stain resistance. Conveniently stored in an included ceramic holder, the kitchen tools include: 11-3/4-inch ladle, 12-inch pasta server, 12-inch serving spoon, 12-inch slotted spoon, 12-1/2-inch spatula, 13-inch slotted spatula, and a 13-inch perforated skimmer.

It has an ergonomic handle with a dimple pattern making it comfortable and slip resistant, useful for repetitive slicing. The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. This knife can be used in place of a Santoku knife so you can also cut meats and fruits. 5-1/2" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 5-1/2-inch knife for precisely slicing and chopping vegetables is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Nordic Ware Quiche and Tart Pan" COL feature VAL "Aluminum construction provides even baking and uniform results Premium non-stick interior, dishwasher use is not recommended as it may shorten the life of the nonstick coating Removable bottom makes for easy release and serving 5-cup capacity, 10-inch diameter Made in the USA" COL description VAL "A 10" large quiche pan with removable bottom for easy access.

The Freud D1080X makes this process easy, fast, and precise. To save you time, most cuts made by this blade require little to no sanding. Trim carpenters, fine cabinetmakers, and avid do-it-yourselfers will want to keep this blade on hand for those special jobs that call for making ultra-fine finish crosscuts in delicate pieces. Appropriate application materials include oak, pine, melamine, veneer plywood, and delicate molding. <b>Produces Smooth, Quiet Cuts with Laser-Cut Kerf</b><br>The Freud D1080X's clean-cutting design means that you can enjoy the comfort of smooth performance. The thin 0.98-inch kerf between the blade's 80 Hi-ATB (alternate-top bevel) teeth is laser cut to provide ease of feed, so you have more control over the blade's position. This helps maximize both the accuracy of the cut and the efficiency of your work, so you enjoy a job well done and the ability to complete more tasks in less time. An added bonus, the blade's laser-cut stabilizer vents reduce noise and vibration during operation, keeping your work environment more relaxed and your hands more in control. This feature also reduces friction and warping, helping to extend the blade's cutting life. <b>Features Shock-Resistant Carbide for Long-Lasting Precision</b><br>So you can count on it over the long term, the Freud D1080X is designed for durability. The blade's hardy teeth are protected by Freud's exclusive shock-resistant TiCo Hi-Density Carbide formula, which helps fight wear and tear and maintains blade sharpness up to four times longer than standard carbide. And protecting the blade is Perma-Shield Non-Stick Coating that provides resistance to heat and corrosion. <b>Fits Miter and Table Saws</b><br>The Freud D1080X is a great addition to your workshop because it's designed with the versatility to fit a variety of table and miter saws, including sliding miter saws. This product is covered by Freud's Limited Lifetime Warranty. <b>What's in the Box</b><br>Freud D1080X Diablo 10-Inch Ultra-Fine-Finish Saw Blade.<br clear="all">"	1

The roots of the company can be found in Oates' entrepreneurial spirit. He and his brother used to farm the mountain areas of Bat Cave in western North Carolina. They would also help their mother find materials for her crafts. The sons began to make wooden whistles, buckets and bird-houses. They would sell their wares along with her crafts to the people from Charlotte that came through in their horse-drawn buggies on the way to the mountains. Later, Thomas worked at the Ashville Postcard Company. When the Depression hit, he lost his job, but it inspired him to go into business and sell crafts, like cornhusk dolls and woven pieces, that were produced by the local women. He had learned about the wholesale business while working at Ashville. He built a waterwheel to generate electricity at a mill, began making product and opened shop. Over the years, he expanded the company. His son, Lemuel Oates, who would next manage the company, says he worked in the business from a young age. He explains the products were made from cotton scraps left over from making socks. Half-inch circles would be looped together to form a variety of products. Lemuel Oates went to college and then settled in Richmond. In December 1973, he returned to Bat Cave and took over the company. In 2007 his son Travis and his daughter, Molly Oates Sherrill, took over the business."	0
