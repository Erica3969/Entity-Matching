Brass and bronze are copper-based alloys. The yellow brass alloy used in many of Michael's designs contains 70-percent copper and produces a warm, traditional brass look. Red bronze contains almost 85-percent copper. This additional copper content gives the bronze alloy its rich, reddish undertone. The mirrored finish of polished brass and polished bronze is achieved through varying degrees of sanding and buffing. Michael uses these techniques to highlight or accent the raised areas on a piece. The Pineapple is a traditional symbol of abundant hospitality, making it an ideal image for your home's front door."	1

Stainless removable pocket clip included. Designed by Ken Onion. A handsome addition to your kitchen, this all-purpose folding knife is part of Kershaw's Ken Onion collection. The rainbow effect of this knife is caused by a titanium-oxide coating on the stainless steel. The handle underneath the coating is made of 410 stainless steel, while the plain-edge blade is made from Sandvik 14C28N stainless steel. The combination of titanium and steel is designed to make the knife stand up to wear and tear for many years. Like many of Kershaw's other Ken Onion knives, the Rainbow Leek Folding Knife features SpeedSafe, a patented, assisted-opening system that helps the user smoothly open the knife with a manual push on the blade's thumb stud. The SpeedSafe system features a torsion bar, which, when closed, helps keep the knife closed, preventing it from being opened by gravity. To open the knife, the user must apply manual pressure to the thumb stud to overcome the resistance of the torsion bar. After the blade is out of the handle, the torsion bar moves along its half-moon track and takes over. The blade opens smoothly and locks into position, ready for use. The knife comes equipped with a reversible clip that can be rotated 180 degrees for either tip-up or tip-down carry. Made in the United States, the knife measures 4 inches closed and weighs 3.1 ounces. The blade measures 3 inches. <strong>Manufacturer's Warranty</strong><br> Kershaw products are guaranteed for the lifetime of the original owner to be free of defects when received from the factory.

You hastily get ready every morning, head for work, the office, or school, just when the central heating system has finished warming the entire house. It's about as inefficient as it gets. Spot heating solves that problem. No longer will you heat an entire home when you simply need a bit of comfort in the bath or dressing room, or any other room. Even the most efficient central heating systems send heat up the chimney. But NuTone spot heaters deliver every bit of energy back into your home. There's no external venting, so the electricity you convert to heat is delivered directly where you want it. Permanently lubricated motors are quiet and require no maintenance. They can be operated by a built-in adjustable thermostat or an optional wall-mount controller. Heaters may be converted in the field to a choice of wattages/voltages. And for safety, heaters are thermal overload protected and the complete heater assembly conveniently removes from the housing for cleaning. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. NuTone ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. Today, Broan-NuTone leads the industry with forward-thinking residential ventilation products, customized climate, communications and storage solutions and superior customer service. The Broan brand focuses on range hoods, ventilation fans, heater/fan/light combination units, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) fresh air systems, built-in heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators and trash compactors, while the NuTone brand offers door chimes, central vacuum systems, stereo intercom systems, medicine cabinets, ironing centers, ceiling fans and ventilation fans."

GE incandescent lamps represents the state of the art of lamps for residential and commercial use, as well as special purpose lamps for decorative or display applications. In an incandescent lamp, light is generated by heating the filament to incandescence. The hotter the filament, the more efficient it is in converting electricity to light. However, when the filament operates hotter, its life is shortened so the design of each lamp is a balance between efficiency and life. This is why lamps of equal-Wattage may have different lumen ratings and different life ratings. Incandescent lamps of similar size are commonly available with different-Wattage ratings. The fixture-Wattage limit should not be exceeded."

This programmable timer switch can help make you feel more secure and can also save you money on energy costs. The ECONOSWITCH's three modes of operation make it easy to create a customized lighting program that fits your lifestyle. The manual mode operates via a conventional on/off switch. The automatic mode turns lights on/off at sunset and sunrise, or on at sunset and off at your own programmed time--this mode also adjusts for daylight saving. You can also choose vacation mode, which randomly activates your lights to simulate a presence when you're away from home. <b>Fast Installation and Easy Programming</b><br>Thanks to clear instructions and labeled wires, the ECONOSWITCH is quick and easy to install and program. The intuitive three-button interface makes it simple to create up to seven programs per week--the programs can apply to a single day or the entire week via a single-pole three-wire (line, load, and neutral) connection (1,800-watt maximum; 3/4 horsepower at 120 volts). Additionally, for each day of the week, you can choose sunset/sunrise programming, specific on/off times, or both. And when the seasons change, you can count on your lights turning on only when outside conditions warrant--automatic daylight saving updates mean you don't have to reprogram. <b>Versatile Unit Features Backlit Display and LED</b><br>Designed for versatility, the ECONOSWITCH works with motors and all types of lighting. It's compatible with electronic ballasts, compact fluorescent lights, and tungsten lighting up to 12 Amperes.

Now you won't have to wait for your central heating system to do what this Broan fan/heater can do instantly. <div class="aplus" ><div class="two-third-col"> You don't need to heat the entire house to have a comfortable bathroom first thing in the morning. The NuTone QT9093WH combination fan/heater/light/nightlight combines a high-output 1500-watt heater with a 110 CFM ventilation fan and 100-watt lighting, warming your bathroom at the touch of a switch. Now you won't have to wait for your central heating system to do what this Broan fan/heater can do instantly. Offering quiet operation, the QT9093WH produces 3.0 sones of noise to ensure your bathroom remains peaceful. Crafted with galvanized steel and a die-cast zinc grille in white enamel, it's a suitable match for any decor no matter how many times you change the paint color. The bright incandescent lighting uses one 100-watt A19 lamp (not included), and its nightlight function (7-watt bulb, not included) has the perfect glow to light a dark bathroom during a nighttime visit. This easy-to-install combination fan and light projects just three inches from the ceiling, and it includes detachable junction box with three wiring knockouts and a four-function wall switch. Other features include expansion-type hanger bars and mounting brackets, plus a built-in quiet, nonmetallic backdraft damper. You hastily get ready every morning, head for work, the office, or school, just when the central heating system has finished warming the entire house. It's about as inefficient as it gets. Spot heating solves that problem. No longer will you heat an entire home when you simply need a bit of comfort in the bath or dressing room, or any other room. Even the most efficient central heating systems send heat up the chimney. But NuTone spot heaters deliver every bit of energy back into your home. There's no external venting, so the electricity you convert to heat is delivered directly where you want it. Permanently lubricated motors are quiet and require no maintenance. They can be operated by a built-in adjustable thermostat or an optional wall-mount controller. Heaters may be converted in the field to a choice of wattages/voltages. And for safety, heaters are thermal overload protected and the complete heater assembly conveniently removes from the housing for cleaning. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. NuTone ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. Today, Broan-NuTone leads the industry with forward-thinking residential ventilation products, customized climate, communications and storage solutions and superior customer service. The Broan brand focuses on range hoods, ventilation fans, heater/fan/light combination units, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) fresh air systems, built-in heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators and trash compactors, while the NuTone brand offers door chimes, central vacuum systems, stereo intercom systems, medicine cabinets, ironing centers, ceiling fans and ventilation fans."

This subtle approach showcases the showering environment, while adding a touch of a contemporary aesthetic to the space. Levity features a low -inch-profile bottom frame that when paired with a low-threshold shower base creates easy entry and exit to the showering space. The shower door is available with either blade handles (vertical) or gently curved towel bar handles (horizontal), Crystal Clear or Frosted glass on the -inch panels and Crystal Clear on the 3/8-inch panels.

Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. Broan ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation.

Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation.

Bosch is so confident that users will get up to 50-percent longer battery life, that it is offering a 2-year battery guarantee with ProVantage. Bluecore Batteries were engineered with internal cooling rods placed between the battery cells to absorb damaging heat. That way, the battery cells stay cooler during operation and charging as compared with standard batteries which heat up quickly, speeding up chemical breakdown and shortening battery life. Bluecore batteries can charge in 30 minutes while other batteries take up to three hours to charge when hot. And best of all, all Bluecore batteries are compatible with current Bosch cordless tools. This particular combo kit comes with the four major tools, plus two of these Bluecore batteries -- and a magnetic bit holder, side handle, 18-tooth carbide blade, two reciprocating saw blades, a double-ended bit, and a carrying bag to keep everything together."

They are Energy Star qualified, featuring 6" ducting for superior performance. Fits in 2" x 8" ceiling construction. <div class="aplus" ><div class="two-third-col"> Offering a rare combination of high power and low noise, the very quiet Broan QT Series Fan/Light (model QTXE110FLT) moves air at 110 cubic feet per minute (CFM) while producing an ultra-quiet 0.7 sones of sound. The QTXE110FLT comes with two energy efficient 18-watt GU24 fluorescent bulbs for 36 total watts of illumination, and its nightlight function (4-watt bulb not included) has the perfect glow to light a dark bathroom during a nighttime visit. This fan's motor is engineered for continuous operation, and it is UL Listed for use over tub or shower with a GFCI circuit, meaning you can optimize ventilation effectiveness by locating your fan exactly where you need it the most. Other features include 6-inch ducting for superior performance and an adjustable hanger bar system for fast and flexible installation to fit all types of construction (anywhere between 16- to 24-inch on-center joists). The grille measures 13-3/8 x 14-1/4 inches, while the housing measures 10-1/2 x 11-3/8 x 7-5/8 inches. Thanks to its quiet operation, you'll barely notice this fan... except, of course, when you need just the right amount of ventilation and light at the touch of a switch. You can control this fan's operation through a choice of Broan wall control models (available separately): The Broan QT Series provides very low operating noise levels&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;most under one sone. However, quiet operation doesn't mean you have to sacrifice powerful operation. The QT Series is one of Broan's best when it comes to maintaining strong airflow in real world installations. Whether you choose a bath fan, a fan/light, or a combination heater/fan/light, Broan has a perfect solution for every room. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. Broan ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. Today, Broan-NuTone leads the industry with forward-thinking residential ventilation products, customized climate, communications and storage solutions and superior customer service. The Broan brand focuses on range hoods, ventilation fans, heater/fan/light combination units, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) fresh air systems, built-in heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators and trash compactors, while the NuTone brand offers door chimes, central vacuum systems, stereo intercom systems, medicine cabinets, ironing centers, ceiling fans and ventilation fans."	0

Nylon lasts four to five times longer than natural fibers because it is resistant to rot, abrasion, mildew, petroleum products, and most chemicals. It is a strong, soft, lightweight cord. Like manila, nylon has good resistance to ultraviolet deterioration from sunlight (referred to as "UV stability"). The solid braid construction is very firm, round and tightly woven with a special lock-stitch construction which prevents unraveling when cut or torn. solid braided rope stays round, and stands up especially well to chafing of blocks and pulleys. It doesn't rotate under load. The solid braid construction cannot be spliced."

The fan operates at only 6.0 sones. Offering either wall or ceiling installation, its compact polymer housing fits easily between ceiling joists or wall studs. Double-strength steel mounting flanges have keyhole slots for easy installation, and torsion spring grille mounting means that no tools are necessary. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. Broan ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. Today, Broan-NuTone leads the industry with forward-thinking residential ventilation products, customized climate, communications and storage solutions and superior customer service. The Broan brand focuses on range hoods, ventilation fans, heater/fan/light combination units, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) fresh air systems, built-in heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators and trash compactors, while the NuTone brand offers door chimes, central vacuum systems, stereo intercom systems, medicine cabinets, ironing centers, ceiling fans and ventilation fans."

The adjustable design also allows you to secure your patio door in an open position, so you can safely allow fresh air into your home. When not in use, simply swing the patio door security bar up and out of the way. When the unit is in use, it must be properly secured into the saddle. The saddle consists of a metal component along with a plastic component and both must be used together. The metal saddle provides primary support and prevents the door from being forced open. The plastic saddle, which sits in the metal saddle, provides secondary support and features a "one-way" operation mechanism that allows the bar to swing into place easily, but prevents the bar from swinging out of place without user intervention. Potential intruders may try to insert a wire between the stationary panel and the sliding panel to swing the door bar out of place, but the dual saddle system can prevent that from happening. This item can be used on metal, vinyl or wood sliding doors & windows. Note that a properly functioning sliding door handle with a reliable latching/locking mechanism is the primary and most important way to secure your sliding patio door.

It has a space-saving lower tank profile that fits nicely under many bathroom countertops and helps make a bathroom feel more spacious without sacrificing any toilet functionality. The one-piece design also gives the toilet a quieter flush. <b>Tested for Performance</b><br>This toilet, like all Kohler toilets, has been tested to ensure it has sufficient power to flush consistently. In addition, it&rsquo;s been tested to ensure complete flushing (including light waste removal), and goes beyond industry standard testing to verify that it thoroughly rinses the bowl with every single flush. Don&rsquo;t let the compact one-piece design fool you--this is a powerful, tested, toilet. Its flow profile was mapped using computers to track the speed and strength of water as it moves through the toilet when flushing. This testing was then used to optimize flushing power and performance. To further help with a smooth and consistent flush it has a fully-glazed trapway. Finally, the seat has been tested for stain resistance, load bearing, and opening and closing durability to make sure the seat won&rsquo;t wear down from daily usage. <b>WaterSense Certified</b><br>This toilet meets strict flushing performance guidelines established by the EPA's WaterSense program. The WaterSense label is a great place to start when you&rsquo;re looking for water-saving products that perform. Toilets bearing the WaterSense label use at least 20% less water than standard 1.6-gallon toilets while still meeting strict flushing performance standards. Kohler offers a wide array of WaterSense labeled toilets that can save up to 16,500 gallons of water in just one year. <b>Warranty and Dimensions</b><br>This Kohler toilet carries a one-year limited warranty. The toilet measures 27-3/4 inches by 18-3/4 inches by 28-3/16 inches. <b>About Kohler</b><br>Gracious living is marked by qualities of charm, good taste, and generosity of spirit. It is further characterized by self-fulfillment and the enhancement of nature. The Kohler mission is to improve your sense of gracious living in every experience you have with a Kohler product or service. To make this happen, Kohler tries to operate on the leading edge in the design and technology of product and process, maintaining a single level of quality regardless of price point across many product and service categories. <b>What's in the Box</b><br>One Kohler Santa Rosa comfort height one-piece, compact, elongated toilet and one seat. <br clear="all"><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" border="0" align="center" width="700"><tr align="center"><td><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/kohler/Kohler-K-3810-seamless.jpg" onClick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=635,height=561'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/kohler/Kohler-K-3810-seamless-web.jpg" border="0" alt="Kohler Santa Rosa one-piece toilet"></a></td><td><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/kohler/Kohler-K-3810-footprint.jpg" onClick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=700,height=448'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/kohler/Kohler-K-3810-footprint-web.jpg" border="0" alt="Kohler Santa Rosa one-piece toilet"></a></td><td><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/kohler/Kohler-K-3810-comfort.jpg" onClick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=836,height=688'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/aplus/kohler/Kohler-K-3810-comfort-web.jpg" border="0" alt="Kohler Santa Rosa one-piece toilet"></a></td></tr><tr align="center"><td colspan="4"><font size="1"><em><b>The Kohler Santa Rosa one-piece toilet has a seamless design, lower footprint, and comfortable profile (click each to enlarge).</b></em></font></td></tr></table>"	COL title VAL "Wall Decal Decor Decals Art Mermaid Girl Fish Tail Sea Ocean Story Design Mural Bedroom (M1005)" COL feature VAL "ATTENTION!!!!
