It has an elegant gold filligree band on each piece, for a very formal look to any table. Choosing fine china can be daunting, but Mikasa's Palatial Platinum is a classic pattern at an affordable price, so you won't have to wait years to pull off an elegant dinner for eight. The understated design allows for versatile table settings: this pattern looks great on a simple cream tablecloth or is equally as smashing when set on a more vibrantly colored cloth. The place setting consists of a 10-inch dinner plate, a salad plate, a rimmed soup bowl, and a cup and saucer. The platinum design on the rim of each piece looks delicate and has a rich texture; however, the platinum edge is sturdy and will hold up well if you choose to use this as your everyday pattern. The set is dishwasher-safe, but--as with all fine china--it's worth the extra effort to wash it by hand and store it carefully. This pattern is a wonderful choice for a bridal registry. <i>--C.

These three, must have, knives are a perfect starter collection in any kitchen. The sandwich, 8inch cooks knife and a paring knife are the most versitile kitchen knives and are used for a variety of tasks. The Wusthof Culinar brush stainless handle design is combined with a contoured shape to add comfort and control. Located in The Cutlery Capital of the World, Solingen Germany, the Wusthof factory history goes back as far as 1814 when the company was listed with the Duchy of Berg. To this day, the company remains family owned. Throughout it&#8217;s history, Wusthof has focused almost solely on the manufacturing of forged knives for the professional chef and home cooking enthusiast. Wusthof uses a special blend of German steel through out the whole length of the knife. The ingredients of this steel are proudly etched on each blade. Wusthof not only uses the best materials to make a fine knife, but it is also crucial that each blade is precisely tempered. This tempering allows the knife to hold its edge for an extremely long time, yet still be able to be maintained in your home kitchen with out the need to be sent away for maintenance. Our unique compound angle is not seen in many knives. This angle tapers from the spine of the knife to the edge to allow for a sturdy, yet extremely sharp edge while it also tapers from the bolster to the tip to give the knife strength as well as flexibility. Elegant satin-finish handles sculpted from 18/10 stainless steel distinguish Culinar cutlery from W&uuml;sthof's other cutlery lines. Otherwise Culinar knives embody all the virtues of other W&uuml;sthof knives that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. The three knives in this set exemplify that control while providing a cook with the essentials: an 8-inch cook's knife (chef's knife) for rocking through chopping and mincing tasks, a 6-inch sandwich knife for myriad slicing and cutting needs, and a 3-1/2-inch paring knife for fruits and vegetables. Like all fine cutlery, these knives should be hand washed. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Wusthof Culinar 2-Piece Starter Set" COL feature VAL "2-piece starter set includes 8-inch cook's knife and 3-1/2-inch paring knife; handsome gift box Blade, bolster, tang forged from single piece of high-carbon stainless steel Compound tapered blade is laser tested for sharpness and the correct cutting angle Handle sculpted from 18/10 stainless steel with elegant satin finish Hand washing recommended; backed by limited lifetime warranty; made in Germany" COL description VAL "The two must have knives in any kitchen are a cooks knife and a paring knife.

A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity. When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: <b>Grinding mechanism: </b>Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features. <b>Design and appearance: </b>Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table decor. <b>Ease of Use: </b>A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand. Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty. Peugeot's <b>Pepper Grinding Mechanism</b> is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available Peugeot's <b>Salt Crushing Mechanism</b> features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill. Peugeot's <b>Spice Mechanism</b> is made of ceramic, and is specially designed to grind dried spices and flat leafy herbs to release their essential oils. It is particularly effective with dried aromatic herbs such as thyme, parsley, basil, oregano, and herbs de Provence, as well as dried seeds such as cumin. Peugeot's <b>Chili Pepper Mechanism</b> is made of case hardened steel for optimal hardness and resilience. This patented mechanism features a pre-cutting system and dual chamber reservoir. For use with dry, hot chilis such as birds tongue, African devils and Piri Piri. The <b>Nutmeg Shaving Mechanism</b> is made of treated stainless steel which is corrosion resistant, and offers superior edge retention. The Peugeot nutmeg shaver is equipped with a double stainless steel grater blade and a strong claw which enables the whole nutmeg to be very finely shaved, while keeping fingers safe. Intended for use with whole nutmeg nuts. Peugeot's <b>Wet Salt mechanism</b> has been specially designed for wet sea salt: a spiral guides the salt, ensuring that it does not stick together. The mechanism is made of ceramic because wet salt crystals are soft (wear is not an issue) but corrosive. Intended for use with damp sea salts such as Sel de Guerande. The <b>Coffee Grinding Mechanism</b> found in all Peugeot coffee mills is the foundation of Peugeot's grinding legacy. The case-hardened steel mechanism efficiently cracks and grinds coffee beans to the desired consistency:from espresso fine to coffee- press coarse. For best results, hold mill and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only To adjust the Grind on manual mills not equipped with u'Select, turn the adjustment nut located on the top of the mill. - clockwise to obtain a finer grind - counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind Electric mills permit single-handed use, leaving you free to cook at the same time. Just press the button to start grinding. To adjust the grind on an electric mill, turn the thumbwheel grind adjustment (found below the grinding mechanism on electric mills that are not equipped with the u'Select system). - Clockwise to obtain a finer grind, - Counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind. Classic Electric Salt Mills (not fitted with the u'Select grind adjustment system) are pre-set to medium and cannot be adjusted.

Girth Measurements: Girth M 27"-35" Girth L 30"-37" Girth XL 32"-39" How To Measure Your Dog Find your dog's girth, which is the widest point of your dog's chest and rib cage area. Harness size measurements are based on girth, which can vary according to breed. Some dogs, like Boxers, are more deep-chested than others. It is important to accurately measure your dog's girth for the best size possible. 1) Stand over your dog and place one end of the tape measure on his spine, just above the widest part of his rib cage. 2) With your other hand, wrap the tape measure behind his front legs and around his body, going underneath the widest part of his rib cage. Place this end next to the beginning of the tape. Put your thumb on the number that meets up with the beginning of the tape measure. The higher number is the girth measurement. 3) Order the proper harness size based on your dog's girth measurement. If your dog's measurement falls between two different sizes, order the larger size if want to allow room to grow."	0

Now you won't have to wait for your central heating system to do what this Broan fan/heater can do instantly. <div class="aplus" ><div class="two-third-col"> You don't need to heat the entire house to have a comfortable bathroom first thing in the morning. The NuTone QT9093WH combination fan/heater/light/nightlight combines a high-output 1500-watt heater with a 110 CFM ventilation fan and 100-watt lighting, warming your bathroom at the touch of a switch. Now you won't have to wait for your central heating system to do what this Broan fan/heater can do instantly. Offering quiet operation, the QT9093WH produces 3.0 sones of noise to ensure your bathroom remains peaceful. Crafted with galvanized steel and a die-cast zinc grille in white enamel, it's a suitable match for any decor no matter how many times you change the paint color. The bright incandescent lighting uses one 100-watt A19 lamp (not included), and its nightlight function (7-watt bulb, not included) has the perfect glow to light a dark bathroom during a nighttime visit. This easy-to-install combination fan and light projects just three inches from the ceiling, and it includes detachable junction box with three wiring knockouts and a four-function wall switch. Other features include expansion-type hanger bars and mounting brackets, plus a built-in quiet, nonmetallic backdraft damper. You hastily get ready every morning, head for work, the office, or school, just when the central heating system has finished warming the entire house. It's about as inefficient as it gets. Spot heating solves that problem. No longer will you heat an entire home when you simply need a bit of comfort in the bath or dressing room, or any other room. Even the most efficient central heating systems send heat up the chimney. But NuTone spot heaters deliver every bit of energy back into your home. There's no external venting, so the electricity you convert to heat is delivered directly where you want it. Permanently lubricated motors are quiet and require no maintenance. They can be operated by a built-in adjustable thermostat or an optional wall-mount controller. Heaters may be converted in the field to a choice of wattages/voltages. And for safety, heaters are thermal overload protected and the complete heater assembly conveniently removes from the housing for cleaning. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. NuTone ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. Today, Broan-NuTone leads the industry with forward-thinking residential ventilation products, customized climate, communications and storage solutions and superior customer service. The Broan brand focuses on range hoods, ventilation fans, heater/fan/light combination units, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) fresh air systems, built-in heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators and trash compactors, while the NuTone brand offers door chimes, central vacuum systems, stereo intercom systems, medicine cabinets, ironing centers, ceiling fans and ventilation fans."

There's no reason you can't add them to your landscape. The beautiful sweet autumn clematis is a vigorous semievergreen (or deciduous) vine than can climb up to 30 feet.

The seed heads are pretty, too, with their silvery-gray featherlike styles. It is hardy in zones 4-9. There is an old saying with Clematis; "Tops in the sun and feet in the shade." In other words the vine blooms best in the sun and benefits from a cluster of small plants, planted around the base of the plant. Many people simply plant a ground cover like ivy, myrtle, or pachysandra around the plant to shade the base. Clematis does best in fertile, humus rich, well-drained soil.

This knife is made from a single piece of high quality CROMOVA 18 stainless steel with a square tip and an ultra sharp blade. The ice tempered, convex edge can hold a sharper edge for a longer time so you can slice vegetables and make a delicious bowl of pasta primavera. It has an ergonomic handle with a dimple pattern making it comfortable and slip resistant, useful for repetitive slicing. The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. This knife can be used in place of a Santoku knife so you can also cut meats and fruits. 5-1/2" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 5-1/2-inch knife for precisely slicing and chopping vegetables is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Global GS-14-6 inch, 15cm Serrated Utility, Scallop Knife" COL feature VAL "Razor sharp Stays sharper longer Perfectly balanced Stainless steel seamless construction Sure-grip handles" COL description VAL "Slice sausage and vegetables to make delicious jambalaya with the Global serrated utility knife.

Even when exhausted as an organic adsorbent, de*nitrate continues to be an excellent support for the biological filter and does not have to be removed. This product is sold by volume. Cited weight is minimal weight.DIRECTIONS: For best results, de*nitrate should be placed to assure the flow of water through it, such as in a canister filter, chemical filtration module, or box filter.  Flow rate should not exceed 200 L (50 gallons*) per hour. If higher flow rates are unavoidable, use Matrix or Pond Matrix. It is best to rinse off dust before use. Once de*nitrate  has been in use for several days, nitrate concentrations should start to fall and level off gradually at a concentration of about 45 mg/L as nitrate. As long as nitrate concentrations remain under control, the product is not exhausted. Each 1 L of de*nitrate  treats about 200400 L (50100 gallons*), depending on initial nitrate concentration and the current biological load.

The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder? In addition to the Host Guide, eight player's books, and the tape, the package contains a map of the crime scene, secret clues, guest invitations, and nametags. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>"	1

It's still hard to get a triple word score, the tiles are still made of wood, there's only one "X" in the whole box, and family feuds are increasing exponentially. But after 50 years, Scrabble has had a face-lift: a swivel base allows the board to turn so players don't have to work upside down, a plastic grid helps keep tiles in line, and a handy bag stores the letters when they're not in use. The premise hasn't changed at all--two to four players battle it out to make high-scoring words from seven little letters--so choose a dictionary before play begins to avoid ugly confrontations. <i>--Lynne Sampson</i>"	1

Each player tends a small garden composed of four different types of vegetables. The object is for all players to harvest all the vegetables before winter arrives. If one of the four colors comes up when the color-coded die is thrown, then each player may harvest one vegetable of that color from his or her own garden or from any of the other gardens. If the die comes up black, each player may choose which color vegetable to pick. If the die shows a white dot, then a Winter piece must be placed on the board. The game ends when all players harvest all vegetables, or when all six Winter pieces are filled in. Cooperation is encouraged with a few special rules: if a player's garden has been completely harvested and he or she rolls the white dot, then a winter piece is <i>removed</i>. Players are thus subtly encouraged to concentrate on one garden at a time, instead of each tending only to their own gardens. <I>--Michael Fehlauer</I>"	COL title VAL "Family Pastimes Princess - A Co-operative Game" COL feature VAL "Players work together helping to rescue the sturdy little princess from the guarded castle We'll do some sharing, help each other to remember where special things are hidden, and together think our way past the obstacles Awarded the Canadian Toy Testing Top Rating For 2 to 4 players ages 4 through 7 years Hand-made in Canada using recycled boards and papers, soy-based inks, water based glues and safe paints" COL description VAL "An exciting fantasy game offering a thoughtful and imaginative play experience!

As players move their pieces around the board, they uncover tools such as a boat, key, or magic potion. These are used to get past six obstacles that guard the princess: a moat, a guard dog, a sentry, a locked door, a dark tunnel, and a magic spell. It's a race against time, because in addition to objects, the board contains spaces that advance the coming of the night and the end of the game. Cooperation comes into play when players help each other come up with creative uses for the various objects. The horse, for example, might be used to swim the moat or run past the dog, or might be traded to the guard as a bribe. Since all players are working toward a common goal, everyone wins or loses as a team."	1

The birds are still hand-crafted in the U.S. and the flock has increased from one to over one hundred. The birds, critters, dogs and cats are made from recycled materials; scrap and rejected garden tools, farm machinery, bicycle and auto parts. Buying a Yardbird reduces solid waste destined for a landfill. If everyone bought two or three, we could save the earth! Seriously, so far over 2 million pounds of scrap has been recycled into these lovable critters. Each critter has its own personality. No two are exactly alike. Whether its a turn of the head, the placement of the eyes, or the variation in the hand painted finish, each one has a delightful disposition all its own. Painted critters are coated by hand with water-based low bake enamel paints. The colors are bright and cheery. Unpainted critters are rusty and will continue to rust-thats their natural beauty. Since they are made from recycled materials, each critter is slightly imperfect and unique, but lovable all the same. These collectable critters, leave our hands as fast as they're created. Full of charm, a little mischievous, we know these pets will guard your garden, front door, hallway, or deck with real attitude."

As players move their pieces around the board, they uncover tools such as a boat, key, or magic potion. These are used to get past six obstacles that guard the princess: a moat, a guard dog, a sentry, a locked door, a dark tunnel, and a magic spell. It's a race against time, because in addition to objects, the board contains spaces that advance the coming of the night and the end of the game. Cooperation comes into play when players help each other come up with creative uses for the various objects. The horse, for example, might be used to swim the moat or run past the dog, or might be traded to the guard as a bribe. Since all players are working toward a common goal, everyone wins or loses as a team."	1

Rodin's goal, as he put it, was "to render inner feelings through muscular movement." He achieved this aim by joining his profound knowledge of anatomy and movement with special attention to the body's surfaces, saying, "The sculptor must learn to reproduce the surface, which means all that vibrates on the surface, soul, love, passion, life...Sculpture is thus the art of hollows and mounds, not of smoothness, or even polished planes." <BR><BR> Features:<BR><BR><BR>"	COL title VAL "J.A.

The Forged line gets its name from the construction of the knives' blades, which are hot-drop forged in Germany from high-carbon stainless steel. High-carbon steel provides maximum sharpness and edge retention. The knives are finished in Switzerland and ice tempered to sustain sharpness longer, even after resharpening. They feature a single-piece full-tang construction for stability and balance, as well as bolsterless edges for use of their entire blades and ease of sharpening. Triple-riveted for durability and ergonomically designed to provide optimum weight, balance, and comfort, the Plastic-Over-Molded (POM) handles will hold their shape and not crack or separate from blades. The Victorinox Forged collection is an extensive range with open-stock pieces as well as handy and versatile sets. With its "S" shaped edge and thin, flexible blade, the boning knife is ideal for separating meat, poultry, or fish from the bone with precise control. It makes a great gift for the home chef who already has everything else, or anyone looking to round out a collection. All Forged cutlery should be washed by hand for best care, and Victorinox covers each piece with a lifetime warranty against manufacturer defects. <b>From the Manufacturer</b> <div class="leftImage" style="width:80px"> <img src=" https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/Victorinox_Logo.jpg" width="80" height="30" alt="Victorinox" /></div> <div class="rightImage" style="width:200px"> <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/Victorinox_Forged_Cutlery-s.jpg" title="Victorinox Forged Cutlery"> <img src=" https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/Victorinox_Forged_Cutlery-s.jpg&rdquo; width="200" height="230" alt=" Victorinox Forged Cutlery" /></a> <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/Victorinox_Forged_Cutlery.jpg">View larger.</a></div> </div> <b>Who is Victorinox?</b><br> Although Victorinox is known the world over as the creator of the Original Swiss Army Knife, the company started out in 1884 as a cutlery workshop. By the time company creator Karl Elsener delivered his first pocket knife to the Swiss Army, his cutlery business was already booming. Over the next century, Victorinox cutlery became a top-rated choice among professionals worldwide, with over 300 blades to offer. Victorinox knives have regularly appeared as highly ranked and recommended kitchen tools in <i>Cook&rsquo;s Illustrated</i>, <i>Men&rsquo;s Health</i>, <i>The Cincinnati Enquirer</i>, <i>New York Magazine</i>, and <i>Natural Health</i>, just to name a few. In 2009, the company announced a partnership with professional chef, Daniel Humm, of Eleven Madison Park in New York City. In addition, building on the success of its cutlery business, Victorinox has brought all the same quality and expertise to a wider range of products and accessories, including other kitchen tools, pocket tools, watches, luggage, and clothing. <b>What is a forged blade?</b><br> <div class="leftImage" style="width:350px"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/Victorinox_Forged_Knives.jpg&rdquo; alt="Victorinox Forged Knives"> </div> Forging is the process by which metal is transformed into a knife&rsquo;s shape. A forged knife requires more metal to make it, so it&rsquo;s usually heavier and thicker than a stamped knife and, in many cases, is considered the stronger and superior blade. Forged knives usually have a steel bolster at the beginning of the handle and a tang that runs through the handle&rsquo;s center. All Victorinox forged cutlery is hot-drop forged, which is a high-quality, time-tested method of manufacturing. Steel is super heated and placed under a multi-ton forging hammer, where it is hammered into the shape of the die. The hot metal is placed on the bottom part of the die and the top part of the die drops onto it with great force, causing the metal to spread into the shape of the die. This is only the first of many steps required by expert craftsmen. Additional processing, tempering, grinding, heat treating, polishing, and more, are the reasons why forged knives cost a bit more. Much more effort goes into their creation than in the creation of stamped blades. <b>What knives do I need to own?</b><br> Knife choice or selection is determined by many factors--size, function, style, and preference. The most important factor is function. Different knives have different uses. It is important to use the proper knife for a specific task, since proper knife selection and the use of a proper-sized, sharp knife make for safe cutting. General kitchen tasks and the knife to use for them are as follows: <b>Paring:</b> The most common to own and use, a paring knife is generally for small cutting jobs and peeling of vegetables or fruit. The blade size is usually from three to four inches. Choose the shape and size to fit your hand. Since this is one of the more versatile knives, owning more than one is recommended. <b>Chef's:</b> The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef&lsquo;s knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef&rsquo;s best friend. <b>Slicer:</b> Most commonly used to slice meats, poultry, and seafood, the slicer is an important companion to any host or hostess. <b>Boning:</b> As its name suggests, a boning knife is used to trim or remove meat and fish from the bone. <b>Bread:</b> Designed with a special edge, a bread knife makes easy work of cutting through crusty bread, pastries, or any item with a crust and a soft interior. <b>Fillet:</b> Most often used by pros and seasoned home chefs, the fillet knife is used to fillet meat and fish. <b>Cleaver:</b> An important addition to any collection, a cleaver is often used to cut or chop through bones. <b>Santoku:</b> This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts. <b>Utility:</b> An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats. <b>Shaping:</b> With its curved blade, a shaping knife is great for small precision cuts where control is essential, such as peeling, trimming, or garnishing. <b>What are the different knife edges and what do they do?</b><br> <b>Straight:</b> The vast majority of Victorinox knives come with a straight or fine edge. This means it has a perfect taper along the blade and no serrations. It is designed to cut without tearing or shredding. <b>Serrated:</b> An edge designed with small, jagged teeth along the edge. <b>Scalloped:</b> A blade with waves along the edge generally used to cut breads with a hard crust and soft interior, as well as tougher-skinned fruits and vegetables. <b>Granton:</b> This edge has hollowed-out grooves or dimples on the sides of the blade. These grooves fill with the fat and juices of the product being cut, allowing for thin, even cuts without tearing. Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel. <b>How should I care for my cutlery?</b> <br> After use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment. Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher&rsquo;s agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade. <b>How do I keep my knives sharp?</b><br> All quality knives require proper maintenance to keep them in perfect cutting shape. The best of edges will quickly dull if it strikes metal, glass, or formica. A wooden cutting board makes the best cutting surface. And, if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user. Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges. <div class="rightImage" style="width:300px"> <img src=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/How_To_Steel_A_Knife.jpg width="300" height="203" alt="How to steel a knife"></div> <b>How to Steel a Knife</b><br> 1. Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip.<br> 2. Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown.<br> 3. Raise back of blade one-eighth inch.<br> 4. Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down.<br> 5. Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel.<br> 6. Repeat five or six times. When a sharpening steel no longer does the job, it&rsquo;s time to take the knife to a qualified knife sharpener who will place a new edge on it. This, along with use of the sharpening steel, will give you many years of sharp, safe blades. Please note that electric knife sharpeners can be harmful. They have to be used carefully as they remove too much metal, can harm the temper of the blade, and most important can change the factory-applied edge angle. <b>How should I store my knives?</b> <br> Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.</div>"	COL title VAL "Vinotemp VT-SHOTCHILLER Liquor Chiller and Dispenser" COL feature VAL "Chills liquor to as low as an ice 5-degree fahrenheit Thermoelectric cooling system for energy-efficient, ultra-quiet operation Contains a 750 ml reservoir and easy-pour faucet NSF certified Molded tray top allows for simple storage of shot glasses" COL description VAL "Get your shot glasses ready for the Vinotemp Shot Chiller liquor shot chiller and dispenser.

The filament inside an incandescent lamp must be protected so that oxygen does not reach it and cause it to evaporate on contact. Most incandescent lamps are either vacuum-sealed or gas-filled. Incandescent lamp filaments are made of tungsten. Tungsten is a metal that can operate at very high temperatures without evaporating too quickly an resulting in early lamp failure. Incandescent filaments only convert about 10 percent of the energy used into visible light, so it is necessary to use a material that can withstand extremely high temperatures. Most lamps use a coiled filament design, which has been found to be stronger and deliver better performance."	0

COL title VAL "Global G-38-10 inch, 26cm Diamond Sharpening Steel" COL feature VAL "Solid-core rod hones as well as realigns knife edges Made of chrome/vanadium stainless-steel coated with diamond particles Plated with hard chrome for additional resistance to abrasion 3/4-inch oval exposes more surface for quicker work Stainless-steel handle molded for comfort, dimpled for safe grip" COL description VAL "<ul><li>Dimensions: 4.5 IN x 20.2 IN x 14.2 IN</ul> Although steels often are touted as sharpening tools, few actually sharpen knife blades, but they do perform the vital task of realigning, or resetting, edges, which bend when contacting a cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool's chrome/vanadium stainless-steel rod contains hundreds of thousands of diamond particles, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. Using this steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles. However, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings better than a steel without diamonds because it accomplishes the final task of a professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine point. Exceptionally well made, this tool's rod has a solid core and has been plated with hard chrome for additional resistance to abrasion and to extend its life. Because the rod is a 3/4-inch-wide oval, it exposes more surface and works quicker than a cylindrical rod. Like Global's signature knife handles, the steel's handle is molded for comfort and dimpled for a safe grip. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it, and this steel's 10-inch rod is long enough for most household knives. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Global G-74 8.5&quot; Knife-sharpeners, Stainless Steel" COL feature VAL "Model: G-74 Manufacturer: Global Ceramic Sharpener" COL description VAL "The best way to sharpen any knives, not just Global is by whetstone.

Henckels Twin Pro S 6-Inch High Carbon Stainless-Steel Chef's Knife Cooks with small hands find this version of the classic French chef's knife fits. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish Pro S from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Pro S handles are heavier and its knives less weight-forward. The steel used in the Pro S line is identical to that of the Five and Four Star lines. High-tech welding of knives this size and larger combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel.

All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary."	1

COL title VAL "Jafco Black Plastic Muzzle" COL feature VAL "Please refer to sizing chart photo & instructions below Designed to be worn for extended periods Prevents wound licking, eating rocks, garbage, poison, etc Helps with dominant and aggressive dog training" COL description VAL "The Jafco Muzzle has been around for years. It is a plastic basket muzzle that offers a great deal of security, and they go on a lot easier than most muzzles. They come in different sizes, please refer to sizing chart and instructions below. If you are looking for a good utility muzzle that will last for years and years, this is your best choice. All are made with polyethylene plastic with three reinforced rubber straps. The clear plastic muzzle is softer and more flexible than the white or black style plastic muzzles. These muzzles are not designed for muzzle fighting training. DESIGN & USES Can be worn for extended periods without inhibiting the dogs breathing, barking, and panting. Dogs can drink with the muzzle on, using a water bowl or bucket. It is best to "teach" your dog that it is okay to put the muzzle into the water before leaving the dog unattended for any period of time. Prevents wound licking, and eating rocks, garbage, poison, etc. Prevents injuries from dog fights. Allows dogs to use some modes of transportation when properly muzzled, which some transportation companies require. FITTING THE DOG The vinyl nose piece should be just below the dogs stop with the end of the muzzle touching the dogs nose. When on the dog: pull the muzzle out and down; pull the muzzle out and up. If at some point the muzzle comes off, its either too loose or too big. The muzzle should fit comfortably and allow the dog to pant and bark. SIZING TIPS & CHART There are a few things you need to know about sizing a muzzle for your dog: The muzzle cannot be longer than your dogs actual "nose length". If the muzzle is longer than your dog's nose length, the muzzle will be in the dog's line of vision. The muzzle's circumference must be larger than your dog's "nose circumference." We recommend between one and three inches larger than your dog's measurement. If the muzzle is the exact same size as your dog's nose, the dog won't be able to pant."

While the basic form has stayed the same, the advent of electricity has allowed for more creativity in both design and placement. Chandeliers are a great source of general illumination, and the use of a dimmer switch can create just the mood and atmosphere you are looking for -- whether it's a gentle cascade of light over a romantic dinner party or a bright and lively glow for a family dinner.

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000.

It is very saturated with color and the color remains very true even with high heat. The color of the rods are commonly the colors you will receive in your bead. Devardi is a stiffer glass than other COE 104 glasses, which can be very beneficial for decorations, encasing or sculptures. With different heat settings, most Devardi glass colors provide different effects. The opaques tend to mottle with high heat, resembling a marbled look, or remain the color of the rod with cooler flames. Different oxygen/propane mixes also can give different appearances. Devardi is generally a lower heat COE 104 glass. Once you become accustom to it, you will find it to be a great glass. Devardi glass rods are hand pulled, and therefore are not perfectly straight or uniform. And the rods will vary in width and length. But this does not affect the quality."

The D-9's, with their incredible acceleration and climbing ability, proved to be more than a match for the powerful P-51's they opposed.

The experimental X-15 built by North American Aviation was an astonishing craft. It was both an aircraft and a spaceplane, setting speed and altitude records at the edge of outer space in the 1960s. Such was its performance that some pilots could also hold claim to being astronauts. Even today, the hypersonic X-15 holds the record for the fastest ever manned rocket-powered aircraft at a top speed of Mach 6.32 (a staggering 7,274km/h). It was powered by either two XLR11 or one XLR99 jet engines made by Reaction Motors Inc. To begin its flights, a NASA B-52 would carry the experimental craft aloft before releasing it at an altitude of approximately 14km. Three X-15 aircraft were manufactured and test-flown 199 times. Dragon has previously produced an X-15 model (Item No.51022), but this new 1/144 scale item represents the second X-15 prototype.

Every plate, bowl and mug is designed to complement any collection of stoneware, and is finished with Le Creuset's signature three-ring accent along the exterior. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2 1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary."	0

Once complete, you set the wheels in motion, as it were, to try to capture the opposition's mice. But this is no ordinary trap. With this contraption you start by turning the crank, that rotates the gears, that push the lever, that moves the shoe, that kicks the bucket, that sends the ball down the stairs and into the gutter, that leads to the rod that releases a second ball, that falls through the bathtub and onto the springboard, that catapults the diver into the washtub, that causes the cage to fall and--whew!--hopefully, capture a mouse.

A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity. When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: <b>Grinding mechanism: </b>Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features. <b>Design and appearance: </b>Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table decor. <b>Ease of Use: </b>A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand. Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty. Peugeot's <b>Pepper Grinding Mechanism</b> is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available Peugeot's <b>Salt Crushing Mechanism</b> features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill. Peugeot's <b>Spice Mechanism</b> is made of ceramic, and is specially designed to grind dried spices and flat leafy herbs to release their essential oils. It is particularly effective with dried aromatic herbs such as thyme, parsley, basil, oregano, and herbs de Provence, as well as dried seeds such as cumin. Peugeot's <b>Chili Pepper Mechanism</b> is made of case hardened steel for optimal hardness and resilience. This patented mechanism features a pre-cutting system and dual chamber reservoir. For use with dry, hot chilis such as birds tongue, African devils and Piri Piri. The <b>Nutmeg Shaving Mechanism</b> is made of treated stainless steel which is corrosion resistant, and offers superior edge retention. The Peugeot nutmeg shaver is equipped with a double stainless steel grater blade and a strong claw which enables the whole nutmeg to be very finely shaved, while keeping fingers safe. Intended for use with whole nutmeg nuts. Peugeot's <b>Wet Salt mechanism</b> has been specially designed for wet sea salt: a spiral guides the salt, ensuring that it does not stick together. The mechanism is made of ceramic because wet salt crystals are soft (wear is not an issue) but corrosive. Intended for use with damp sea salts such as Sel de Guerande. The <b>Coffee Grinding Mechanism</b> found in all Peugeot coffee mills is the foundation of Peugeot's grinding legacy. The case-hardened steel mechanism efficiently cracks and grinds coffee beans to the desired consistency:from espresso fine to coffee- press coarse. For best results, hold mill and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only To adjust the Grind on manual mills not equipped with u'Select, turn the adjustment nut located on the top of the mill. - clockwise to obtain a finer grind - counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind Electric mills permit single-handed use, leaving you free to cook at the same time. Just press the button to start grinding. To adjust the grind on an electric mill, turn the thumbwheel grind adjustment (found below the grinding mechanism on electric mills that are not equipped with the u'Select system). - Clockwise to obtain a finer grind, - Counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind. Classic Electric Salt Mills (not fitted with the u'Select grind adjustment system) are pre-set to medium and cannot be adjusted.  Peugeot has been pumping out peppermills since the mid 19th century, when the company first created its unique channeling and grinding mechanism, and the Bistro peppermill is one of its finest representatives. Constructed in a classic caf shape with a natural finish, the mill features channeling grooves that line up and crack the peppercorns, and grinding grooves that perform the fine grinding process. The result is pepper ground finer than with other mills. In addition, Peugeot mills are more durable because the teeth in the grinding mechanism never lock together, resulting in less wear over their lifetime (and yours, as the company offers a lifetime guarantee on the mechanism). Users will also appreciate the dual grinding modes--if you crank the unit one direction, you receive a fine pepper grind, whereas the other direction produces a coarse grind. To fill, simply unscrew the top knob and add peppercorns. <I>--Rivers Janssen</I>"	COL title VAL "Peugeot 22594 Bistro 4 Inch Pepper Mill, Chocolate" COL feature VAL "Made in France Mechanism specifically designed to grind whole peppercorns. Mechanism is equipped with a helix-shaped double row of teeth that guide and hold the peppercorns for a perfect grind. Wipe with damp cloth." COL description VAL "<div class="aplus"> <h5> Advantage of Freshly Ground Spices </h5> There are many benefits to freshly grinding pepper, salt, herbs and spices for cooking and seasoning. A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity. When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: <b>Grinding mechanism: </b>Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features. <b>Design and appearance: </b>Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table decor. <b>Ease of Use: </b>A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand. Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty. Peugeot's <b>Pepper Grinding Mechanism</b> is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available Peugeot's <b>Salt Crushing Mechanism</b> features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill. Peugeot's <b>Spice Mechanism</b> is made of ceramic, and is specially designed to grind dried spices and flat leafy herbs to release their essential oils. It is particularly effective with dried aromatic herbs such as thyme, parsley, basil, oregano, and herbs de Provence, as well as dried seeds such as cumin. Peugeot's <b>Chili Pepper Mechanism</b> is made of case hardened steel for optimal hardness and resilience. This patented mechanism features a pre-cutting system and dual chamber reservoir. For use with dry, hot chilis such as birds tongue, African devils and Piri Piri. The <b>Nutmeg Shaving Mechanism</b> is made of treated stainless steel which is corrosion resistant, and offers superior edge retention. The Peugeot nutmeg shaver is equipped with a double stainless steel grater blade and a strong claw which enables the whole nutmeg to be very finely shaved, while keeping fingers safe. Intended for use with whole nutmeg nuts. Peugeot's <b>Wet Salt mechanism</b> has been specially designed for wet sea salt: a spiral guides the salt, ensuring that it does not stick together. The mechanism is made of ceramic because wet salt crystals are soft (wear is not an issue) but corrosive. Intended for use with damp sea salts such as Sel de Guerande. The <b>Coffee Grinding Mechanism</b> found in all Peugeot coffee mills is the foundation of Peugeot's grinding legacy. The case-hardened steel mechanism efficiently cracks and grinds coffee beans to the desired consistency:from espresso fine to coffee- press coarse. For best results, hold mill and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only To adjust the Grind on manual mills not equipped with u'Select, turn the adjustment nut located on the top of the mill. - clockwise to obtain a finer grind - counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind Electric mills permit single-handed use, leaving you free to cook at the same time. Just press the button to start grinding. To adjust the grind on an electric mill, turn the thumbwheel grind adjustment (found below the grinding mechanism on electric mills that are not equipped with the u'Select system). - Clockwise to obtain a finer grind, - Counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind. Classic Electric Salt Mills (not fitted with the u'Select grind adjustment system) are pre-set to medium and cannot be adjusted. "	1

To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track&#039;. Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;In&#039;. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case,  Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do Not Use Steel Wool To Clean Your Track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition.   Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended."

The high quality carbon provides a large porous area to trap minute particles. Besides providing a small sieve for mechanical trapping of organic wastes, carbon also removes liquid wastes from water. These include urine, dyes or impurities in solution. This action provides sparkling clear water in the aquarium. The large internal surface area also provides numerous points for important bacterial colonies to form and thrive. Carbon should always be removed during medication. It has also been recently noted that carbon will adsorb a large percentage of many of the nutrients in plant fertilizer products. As such, it should be used carefully when keeping live plants. Carbon loses its activity without outward sign. In general, carbon should be replaced on a monthly basis to ensure that active adsorption is maintained. <div class="aplus"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> <h5>Fluval Carbon</h5> Fluval Carbon Filter Media Insert is capable of adsorbing most liquified impurities and dyes present in aquarium water.

The figures are detailed, colorful, and convincing -- certain to charm fans of the movie.<P> Players begin by arranging 24 tiles in a six by four grid at the center of the board. Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play. If they're struggling with the written instructions, they can watch the easy-to-follow video tutorial on the DVD. <P> <b>Interactive DVD Keeps Game Exciting </b><br> The entire game is played alongside the interactive DVD. With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers. For this reason, it's recommended for ages 6 and up.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, game board, 24 double-sided board tiles, 5 game movers, instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL title VAL "Imagination Entertainment Family Feud 2 Edition DVD Game" COL feature VAL "Hours of fun the whole family can play Double and triple money rounds Hundreds of questions Just like the actual game show" COL description VAL "It's the same family with an all-new feud.

The 5.17i CrossRamp angle adjusts from 12 to 25 degrees, altering the height of the elliptical path.

In addition, crosstrainers minimize the impact on your joints and lower back, inviting you to exercise more vigorously and burn more calories. <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="200"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/B001L5TL30-console.jpg" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/B001L5TL30-ramp.jpg" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The EFX 5.17i features an intuitive membrane console and adjustable CrossRamp (12 to 25 percent) technology.</strong></em></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> The EFX 5.17i is a breeze to use thanks to the comprehensive membrane console, which offers intuitive keystroke sequencing, multiple feedback options, large LED displays, and accompanying graphics.

This was adequate to deal with the then perceived threat of such NATO tanks as the American M-48 and later models of the British Centurion.

Just ask Lex Parker, Dragon Master of Dragon Chess Inc., which is releasing a new chess game that incorporates a powerful new player on an expanded board."Dragon Chess changes moves that have been practiced and remembered for hundreds of years," says Parker. "It puts the novice and the master on equal terms. Everyone starts fresh so it's your brain working, not just your memory."The new player - called the Dragon - is second in power to the Queen and sits on the far side of each Castle. Like the Queen, the Dragon may move in any direction but advances up to three squares at a time in line. All other players remain in their traditional positions with their normal powers.The extra piece expands the traditional chessboard from 64 to 100 squares, with additional fields of 12 squares flanking each side. Four extra pawns guard the Dragons at the set-up."The beauty of Dragon Chess, which uses the same rules of historical chess, is that it keeps it simple," says Parker, who says Dragon Chess has been in development for over four years. "It's not a whole new learning experience but it is an entirely new game."According to Parker, Dragon Chess represents the next evolution of chess, which has undergone numerous changes since its birth in India in the 6th century. The modern chess played today was invented just 500 years ago, when more power was allotted to the Queen and Bishop."Since the 15th century, inventors have been trying to come up with the next variation on chess that preserves the balance of all the existing players," Parker says. "We believe Dragon Chess is able to accomplish that goal while improving the complexity, dynamics and strategy of the game. We predict a wave of enthusiasm by millions of chess players, young and old.""	0

Basically, the color enhancement concept works by selectively positioning transmission in the blue, green, and red spectral regions whereby one can improve the color discrimination between different color objects. These are the same colors used to produce a color television picture. They optimize the readability of such displays under high ambient light conditions. Phillips 202 Glass utilizes rare earth oxides in its composition to provide the same filtration. This glass is very efficient in filtering sodium flare in addition to providing ultraviolet protection to 390 mm. The Phillips 202 glass is becoming a preferable choice of lamp workers. It is very comfortable for viewing under high ambient light conditions such as when working with glowing heat sources for a duration of time. Also, although it has a relatively low luminous transmission of 38%, it is not recommended for sun protection use unless UV filtering coatings are applied."	0

The game comes with three levels of play, so kids can learn and grow with the game. With more than 55 million units sold, Mastermind is a great strategy game . . . and one of the worlds most popular games ever. Its easy to learn and fast to play, and its different every time. The Codemaker sets a secret code, then the Codebreaker tries to match the code using logic, deduction, and maybe even a little bit of luck. After each move, the Codemaker gives clues to the Codebreaker. With lots of possible code combinations, every game is guaranteed to be a brainteaser. All of this mind game's components can be stored in the game board. For 2 players ages 6 and up; the winner will be a true master mind. Includes game console with built-in storage tray and code peg shield, 72 jungle animal pegs in 6 colors, 30 scoring pegs in two colors, and complete instructions. Younger kids can develop their powers of logic and deduction in this game of code-cracking fun. This version is simplified for younger children and comes with colorful animal pegs, a jungle-and-mountain-theme board, and fewer code options. The point is the same: one player duplicates the other's code in as few turns as possible. The code maker sets a code of 3 colored animals (choosing from 72 in six colors), and conceals it beneath a "rocky mountain" tray at his or her side of the board. In each of nine rows (of large holes), the code breaker attempts to replicate the pattern. After each row (or turn), the code maker places red or white creature pieces in the adjacent row of small holes, which gives the code breaker clues on how he or she doing. Complete instructions include rules for younger players (based on colors only), older players (color and position), and expert players (a blank-space option adds complexity). This challenging and fun game is for two players. <i>--Ava Natov</i>"	COL title VAL "Scientific Toys RC Tarantula" COL feature VAL "Radio Control Spider with real spider like creeping and crawling Looks so real- it might scare your friends!

Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track&#039;. Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;In&#039;. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case,  Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do Not Use Steel Wool To Clean Your Track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition.   Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended. Bachmann hopes you enjoy your train for many years to come!"

COL description VAL "The Perfect-a-Flow Undergravel Filter is a biological filtration system for fresh or saltwater aquariums. The filter circulates water through the gravel bed and oxygenates it for beneficial bacteria growth. The slots on the filter plate have been designed to draw water evenly over the entire plate from front to back and left to right. The high tube connectors are molded into the filter plates to offer a secure grip onto the one-inch diameter lift tubes to keep the tubes from being knocked out by fish and preventing gravel from falling under the filter plate. There are three tube holders and caps. The Perfect-A-Flo air stoneprovides a  flow of fine bubbles. A 3/16 inch ridged tube connects to the air diffuser inside the uplift tube and will attach to airline tubing at the top of the uplift tube. When using an airpump and airstones use two uplift tubes per plate.  The fish protector is molded right into each elbow to prevent fish from entering the uplift tubes.  The Perfect-A-Flo Carbon Cartridge (not included) will fit into the fish protector.  These cartridges contain top-quality activated carbon to remove harmful gases, odors, and unsightly discoloration.For powerhead attachment place the one-inch uplift tube on the outside tube holder. The powerhead should have a flow rate of 100-140gph. Use one uplift tube per plate when using a powerhead. Using a powerhead provides a higher flow rate which cuts down on algae growth and requires less maintenance, however, powerheads are harder to conceal."

High-rate breathers like artichokes and spinach need both vents open. Medium-rate breathers like cabbage and citrus require one open vent. Low-rate breathers like asparagus and berries stay prime with both vents closed. (A chart of various items' needs is included.) The rugged plastic containers are also terrific for ripening tomatoes, apples, pears, and bananas on the counter. The set consists of a rectangular 19-1/2-cup container (14-3/4 inches long, 4-3/4 inches wide, 5 inches high), a rectangular 7-cup container (8-3/4 inches long, 5-3/4 inches wide, 3-1/2 inches high), and a square 4-1/2-cup container (5-3/4 inches square, 3-1/4 inches high). They fit together compactly, have textured seals to resist sliding when stacked, and are translucent so contents can be identified. Virtually unbreakable and dishwasher-safe, Tupperware carries a lifetime warranty against chipping, cracking, breaking, and peeling. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

The challenge is that the board game spins, and the fish open and close their mouths. With 21 fish and 4 fishing rods, there's plenty of fishing fun in this fast-paced competition, and these fish are as hungry as hungry hippos. Let's Go Fishin' is a fishing toy that's great for playing at home or as a travel game--it will lure kids into playing over and over again. For 1-4 players ages 4 and up. Requires 1C battery (not included)."	1

You regulate the airflow within the container thanks to a completely unique, new venting system. Different fruits and vegetables require different amounts of airflow to stay fresh - FridgeSmart Containers know that and create optimal storage conditions for different produce right in your refrigerator. Special built-in grid lifts food away from condensation. Result? No more yellow broccoli and wasted celery - just delicious, healthy fruits and vegetables for the whole family to enjoy all week long! Say goodbye to soggy lettuce and vegetables with this Fridgesmart storage container. Tupperwares unique ACE (Atmosphere Controlled Environment) venting system allows just the right amount of air into the container by means of two vents on the end of the box. Flip open one or both vents, depending on whats inside--a handy guide gives venting recommendations. For instance, broccoli likes a lot of air, zucchini very little. Raised ridges on the bottom of the container allow condensation to drain away from produce, maintaining freshness. Decorated with a wavy line pattern, the textured lid reduces sliding when another container is stacked on top. While the lid creates a tight seal, some effort is required to remove it. The container and lid are dishwasher-safe but should not be used in a microwave. This storage container measures 9 by 6 by 3-1/2 inches and, like all Tupperware products, carries a lifetime warranty against chipping, cracking, breaking, and peeling. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>"	COL title VAL "Tupperware 3-Piece FridgeSmart Set From Tupperware" COL feature VAL "Containers control air supply of refrigerated fruits and vegetables Produce "breathes" and needs varying amounts of air to stay fresh Two vents in each container open and shut according to contents' needs Raised grids on containers' bottoms elevate food out of its own moisture Set comprises three containers: 19-1/2-cup, 7-cup, 4-1/2-cup" COL description VAL "Containers control air supply of refrigerated fruits and vegetables;Produce breathes and needs varying amounts of air to stay fresh;Two vents in each container open and shut according to contents' needs;Raised grids on containers' bottoms elevate food out of its own moisture;Set comprises three containers: 19-1/2-cup, 7-cup, 4-1/2-cup Thanks to Tupperware's ingenious ACE (Atmosphere Controlled Environment) system, the three containers in this set keep produce fresher in the refrigerator. Because fruits and vegetables "breathe" and require varying amounts of air each container has two vents. The containers' bottoms also have raised grids to elevate produce above its own moisture and prevent spoilage. The vents open and shut with the touch of a finger. High-rate breathers like artichokes and spinach need both vents open. Medium-rate breathers like cabbage and citrus require one open vent. Low-rate breathers like asparagus and berries stay prime with both vents closed. (A chart of various items' needs is included.) The rugged plastic containers are also terrific for ripening tomatoes, apples, pears, and bananas on the counter. The set consists of a rectangular 19-1/2-cup container (14-3/4 inches long, 4-3/4 inches wide, 5 inches high), a rectangular 7-cup container (8-3/4 inches long, 5-3/4 inches wide, 3-1/2 inches high), and a square 4-1/2-cup container (5-3/4 inches square, 3-1/4 inches high).

COL title VAL "Bachmann Industries New York, Susquehanna And Western #3018 EMD SD40-2 DCC Equipped Diesel Locomotive" COL feature VAL "DCC Equipped for speed, direction and lighting Dual-mode digital command control decoder enabling operation with a standard DC analog power pack or any NMRA-compliant Digital Command Control system Performs best on 18" radius curves or greater E-Z Mate Couplers HO Scale 1:87 Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended." COL description VAL "EMD SD40-2 DCC Equipped Diesel Locomotive - NEW YORK, SUSQUEHANNA & WESTERN #3018 - HO Scale.

Meridian Elit knives are handcrafted and polished one at a time using the same techniques that have been the hallmark of fine Solingen-made cutlery that have stood the test of time. Meridian Elit knives are the authentically superior, forged and triple-riveted knives manufactured in Solingen, Germany.Crafted from 3rd generation craftsmen in the historical cutlery city of Solingen, Germany.The Messermeister Meridian Elit 8" Carving Knife, has a narrow spear-point, fine-edge blade that is used for small to medium carving chores. It separates meat from the bone and slices it into thin serving portions. This knife's narrow, thin blade makes any carving job a breeze. The 8-inch blade, long enough for most slicing tasks, neatly carves slices--thick or thin--from roast beef, ham, and turkey. One of Messermeister's top-of-the-line Elite knives, which are distinguished from the company's first-rate San Moritz knives by a three-step hand sharpening process blades undergo and classic three-rivet, full-tang, seamless polymer handles, the knife is forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel. The blade has a shortened bolster so it's sharp from tip to heel and a cook's forefinger rests comfortably on it. Made in Germany, the knife comes in a padded gift box. To keep the blade sharp, it's best to hand wash this knife in soapy water. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Messermeister Meridian Elite 8-Inch Kullenschliff Carving Knife and Park Plaza 7-Inch Fork" COL feature VAL "Ergonomic balance.

In addition, unlike rubber liners, there are eight Standard colors available - Black, Clear, Competition Blue, Sky Blue, White, Gray, Tan and Forest Green and Designer Accent Colors are available in three colors - Gold, Copper and Silver. Pond Shield is used for waterproofing structured surfaces found in water features such as Koi ponds, pools, fountains, aquariums, salt water tanks, hydroponics, streams, waterfalls, reflecting pools, mini lakes, holding tanks, etc. Easily applied and easy to maintain, for most applications, a single coat application is all that is needed for proper coverage. In addition, your pond will be virtually maintenance free with a surface that algae can be easily wiped off of and is safe for fish and plants. Pond Shield offers both strength and flexibility in a coating, strength and flexibility that is tested from -78 Degree F to 140 Degree F. Pond Shield is an epoxy pond liner that has been specifically designed to bond to porous or abraded materials such as concrete, wood, stone, most metals (treated and non-treated), brick, most ridged plastics, tile and many more. With a tensile bond strength stronger than the internal strength of the concrete, your single coat of Pond Shield epoxy will stick to what you apply it to. Over time, hairline cracks can form in concrete, mortar or grout joints. Being flexible, Pond Shield resists mimic cracking and provides the best protection possible in a coating."

Dental Fresh is the only clinically-proven formula for cat oral health providing multiple benefits: cleans and whitens teeth, freshens breath, protects gums while treating gingivitis, prevents periodontal disease, and improves overall dental health.<br /> <br /> When cats develop dental disease, it can lead to additional problems throughout their body. That is why it is so important to recognize the signs of dental issues in your cat &ndash; bad breath, yellow or brown teeth, swollen, inflamed, red, puffy gums, weight loss, and poor appetite &ndash; and prioritize oral health. Dental Fresh makes that incredibly easy. <br /> <br /> Our clinically-proven water additive features a unique self-regulating formula that activates, releases and destroys bad breath causing germs and bacteria microorganisms only when exposed to bacteria, periodontal pathogens, and acidic areas where plaque has formed. The more &ldquo;issues&rdquo; present, the stronger the formula works for your cat. And, in turn, the less &ldquo;issues&rdquo; present, the less the formula targets those areas. All of the cats (and dogs!) in your household can safely drink from the same water bowl because each pet will receive a different dosage of the active ingredient, depending on their individual dental needs. And unlike many water bowl additives on the market, Dental Fresh contains no alcohol, no sugar, no surfactants or detergents, and no pungent mint flavors. It does not cause staining, has no taste or artificial flavorings, and can be safely used long-term. Dental Fresh Original Formula for Cats is available in an 8-fluid ounce bottle.<br /> <br /> We know that your cats are more than just pets - they are part of the family - so Dental Fresh designs premium oral health products that pet parents can actually afford.

Each player tends a small garden composed of four different types of vegetables. The object is for all players to harvest all the vegetables before winter arrives. If one of the four colors comes up when the color-coded die is thrown, then each player may harvest one vegetable of that color from his or her own garden or from any of the other gardens. If the die comes up black, each player may choose which color vegetable to pick. If the die shows a white dot, then a Winter piece must be placed on the board. The game ends when all players harvest all vegetables, or when all six Winter pieces are filled in. Cooperation is encouraged with a few special rules: if a player's garden has been completely harvested and he or she rolls the white dot, then a winter piece is <i>removed</i>. Players are thus subtly encouraged to concentrate on one garden at a time, instead of each tending only to their own gardens. <I>--Michael Fehlauer</I>"	COL title VAL "Family Pastimes Home Builders - A Multi-Cultural Co-operative Game" COL feature VAL "A real-life theme where players help to build as many homes as we can The homes are from different cultures, past and present, so we learn a bit about other kinds of shelter, too Enjoy family game time more by playing with one another rather than against each other For 1 to 8 players ages 5 through 9 Hand-made in Canada using recycled boards and papers, soy-based inks, water based glues and safe paints" COL description VAL "A real-life theme where players help to build as many homes as we can.

COL title VAL "Bachmann Industries Alco S4 DCC Sound Value Equipped HO Scale #816 Milwaukee Road Locomotive" COL feature VAL "DCC Sound Value Equipped Locomotive Locomotive backed by Bachmann's exclusive Limited Lifetime Warrantee Preforms best on 18" radius curves or greater HO Scale  1:87 - Conforms with NMRA (National Model Railroad Association) Standards Operating Headlight Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended."

All Harrisville products are 100% Made in the USA. Introduce children to the joys of weaving with this sturdy wooden peg loom, made just for beginners. Easy-to-read instructions with big diagrams make learning a snap. Weavers begin by looping heavy cotton string between the loom's slanted nylon pegs, forming the "warp" of their design. Then, using the long, plastic needle and brightly colored yarn provided, they weave the "weft"--the filling that goes over and under the string--creating designs and holding the piece together. In addition to a sense of accomplishment, children get the chance to practice math and fine-motor skills. They can use this 7.5-by-10-inch loom to create wall hangings, doll blankets, coasters, bookmarks, and more. Winner of the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio's Gold Seal Award. <i>--Joan DeClaire</i>"	1

Here at KFS Industries, we believe our products can only be as good as the materials used in the build. While it may cost more to use better materials, the end result is a solid product built to pass down for generations to come. Our competitors use Sheet metal construction, which will allow the bipods to flex and possibly bend with heavier recoiling weapons. Versa-Pod bipod legs are machined from solid billets (aluminum or steel depending on model) and include positive locking notches eliminating movement. With other manufactures, the legs have radial grooves which are lathe turned -simple and cheap. The groove all the way around weakens the entire bipod leg. Our locking notches are individually machined ONLY where the latch locks the leg  more expensive, but much stronger. Solid milled materials eliminate bipod flex, allowing for more consistent precision and a stable platform to shoot from. These are very important points to consider when you are choosing you next bipod. Try the Versa-Pod and you will feel the difference!"

Helps tenderize economical cuts of meat. Works on regular and smooth-top ranges. Cover lock indicator shows when there is pressure inside the cooker and prevents the cover from being removed until pressure is safely reduced. Includes a special rack for cooking several foods at once with no intermingling of flavors. Dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. Liquid capacity: 4 quarts (3.8 liters). Pressure cookers have experienced renewed popularity over the last several years because cooks have rediscovered what some cooks (particularly grandmas) have known for a long time--they're really fast. And it's easy to cook healthfully with pressure cookers, since the food retains so much more of its nutrients and flavor. Presto's 4-quart aluminum pressure cooker is a multi-purpose pot that can stand in as a conventional soup pot as well as perform the kitchen magic that pressure cookers are famous for. Chicken Cacciatore cooks in 8 minutes! This durable, polished-aluminum pressure cooker is an economical addition to any well-rounded set of kitchen tools. The heavy-duty lid locks down during cooking; an inner sealing ring keeps the steam in. In addition to a pop-up pressure indicator and a simple steam release mechanism, there is an overpressure plug that will let off steam if it builds up excessively. This pressure cooker is useful for weeknight dinners or for any meal that needs to come together quickly. An accompanying booklet contains more than 65 recipes, ranging from basic soup stocks to stews and pot roast--even desserts like Oatmeal-Apple Crisp! Tenderize lean cuts of beef or pork; or cook chicken, fish, or vegetables faster than you can in a microwave, and without losing moisture. Nonabrasive cleansers are best for cleaning this polished aluminum pressure cooker, though occasional use of a fine metal polish will help the exterior keep its shine. The Presto 4-quart aluminum pressure cooker is fully immersible; in addition, the sealing ring should be removed after each use to allow cleaning of the inside rim of the lid. The vent pipe is simple to keep clean with a small brush or pipe cleaner, and both the air vent/cover lock and the overpressure plug are removable. The pressure cooker measures 9 inches in diameter (14 inches including handle) and 7 inches tall (including lid). Presto guarantees this pressure cooker with an extended 12-year warranty. A detailed instruction and recipe booklet is included; special safety issues that pertain to pressure cookers are clearly explained. <i>--Garland Withers</i>"	0

COL description VAL "Encore Deluxe Clear your throat and drink that honey-lemon tea: It's time to play Encore, the game of dueling larynxes. The goal is to come up with a song that contains particular words--and then sing lines from the song that contains those words. Here's how it works: The first team turns up a card featuring five words; the two teams then take turns singing at least six words of any song that contains one of those five. The round continues until one team is stumped, which, if the word is "love," could take a while. But repetition is not allowed, and for every "said" and "moon," there's a "highway" or "piano"--whaddya do when you've exhausted the Billy Joel songbook? And it's great to draw a lyric that's in a song title, but if you don't know five others that come after, you'll be like the player who drew "nice"; he spent the entire run of the sand timer with his shoulders hunched like Sinatra because he couldn't connect "and let's make all the stops along the way" with the song's title, "Nice 'N' Easy." Oh, and don't play Encore with Renaissance Faire actors--when they draw the word "lady," they'll come up with an inexhaustible supply of 15th-century madrigals. Only after they've won will you discover that they were all bogus. <I>--Tony Mason</I>"	1

Cardomom is a unique herb and it is used in many different dishes, from desserts, to meats, to flavor coffee. Start the seed indoors. Press the seed into soil; cover it with  -  inch of soil and keep the seed moist. Cardamom seed needs both cold temperatures and warm temperatures to germinate. Keep the seed at 75F or warmer for 4 weeks and at 36F for 2  3 weeks. Germination can take up to 8 weeks. Transplant the young plant outdoors after danger of frost has passed. Cardamom prefers a position in full sun to partial shade and rich soil. Space the plant 36 - 60 inches apart."

The purpose of mechanical filtration is to trap and accumulate debris and waste material coming from the pond. The purpose of biological filtration is to convert toxic by-products of fish metabolism and other organic waste into much less harmful substances. The purpose of UV-C filtration is to inhibit single-celled algae growth. <div class="centerImage"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PetSafe/LagunaPressureFloDetails._SL500_.jpg" alt="Laguna Pressure-Flo" height="201" width="500"></div> All ponds will benefit from the addition of a filtration system. A good filtration system, such as the Laguna Pressure Flo ensures that the water quality of the pond will remain clear of impurities which can accumulate and create a cloudy or toxic environment for pond plants and fish. The Laguna Pressure Flo will provide your fish with a clean and clear environment to live a healthy life in.</div> <div class="half-col last"> <h4>How Pressure-Flo Filters Work</h4> Pressure-Flo filters are designed to provide three important water filtration operations that are essential for keeping pond water clear and healthy: mechanical and biological filtration, and UVC sterilization. The filters are designed to work in tandem with a solids handling pump. For best results, use a Laguna Max-Flo circulating pump. With the filter connected to the outlet of a pump, water enters the unit through the water inlet. It is then forced to pass through the mechanical filtration stage, consisting of foam filters that intercept and trap dirt and debris. Next, water reaches the biological filtration* chamber where it comes into contact with beneficial bacteria. Finally, dirt-free water passes along the UV-C lamp unit, where it is exposed to ultraviolet rays that inhibit algae growth and green water. Water then returns to the pond through the outlet.<br><br><b>Backwash-Cleaning System</b><br> During operation, coarse debris is captured at the surface of the foam filters. As a result, sooner or later depending on pond conditions, the external surface of the foam filters will clog and hinder proper filtration, because of reduced water flow. The limited water flow through the foam filters reduces the effectiveness of both the biological and UV-C filtration. This condition can easily be detected thanks to the cleaning indicator on top of the filter unit.<br><br><div class="rightImage"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PetSafe/LagunaPressureFloKeepHandsClean._SL300_.jpg" alt="Laguna Pressure-Flo" height="300" width="222"></div> Pressure-Flo filters feature a unique Backwash-Cleaning System that completely cleans the entire surface of the mechanical foam filters without opening the filter or shutting off the pond&rsquo;s pump. The Backwash-Cleaning is performed by two foam filter scrapers, which are operated by using the plungers located on top of the filter unit&rsquo;s lid. While the pond pump is running, simply turn the backwash valve to the backwash position and begin pulling the plungers one at a time up and down until the water being discharged is clean. After cleaning the filter will perform at optimal levels for many days. The Backwash-Cleaning System prolongs the time between filter breakdown maintenance sessions and in most cases only end of season breakdown cleaning will be necessary.<br><br><b>Pond Tip:</b><br><br> When backwashing or performing maintenance, use the backwash water in your garden - it's an excellent natural fertilizer! Unlike other pressurized filters, water travels through mechanical filtration (where large particles are filtered out) before entering the UV chamber, making the UV sterilization process much more efficient.<br><br><b>Cleaning Indicator</b><br> This unit features a cleaning indicator, which lets you know when the filter needs backwashing or cleaning. The red indicator height is approximately proportional to the filter clogging level. When the red indicator is low, the filter is clean, when the red indicator is at the top of its stroke, the filter needs cleaning.<br><br> The cleaning indicator may be affected by many variables, such as waterfall height and pump performance. Its operating characteristics have been calibrated according to specific application conditions. Different application conditions may lead to different results.<br><br><h4>Breakdown of Filters</h4><br><div class="centerImage"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PetSafe/LagunaPressureFloChart._SL750_.jpg" alt="Laguna Pressure-Flo" height="439" width="628"></div></div>"	COL title VAL "Aqueon 13 LED Widescreen Aquarium Kit" COL feature VAL "Unique aquarium design improves the view of fish Significantly larger front glass area compared to a size 10 aquarium Low profile, energy efficient LED hood Dimensions: 25.88" x 10" x 18.25" Kit Includes: Glass Aquarium, Low Profile LED Full Hood, QuietFlow 10 Power Filter, Medium Filter Cartridge, 50W Submersible Heater, Premium Fish Food Sample, Water Conditioner Sample, Fish Net, Thermometer, Set-up Guide" COL description VAL "The LED Widescreen aquariums are taller, wider and sleeker than traditional aquariums, providing an optimized viewing experience.

COL title VAL "TOPS Knives B.O.B. Brothers of Bushcraft Knife w/Black Handle" COL feature VAL "Overall Length: 10" Blade Length: 4 1/2" Blade Material: 1095 High Carbon RC 56-58 Black Canvas Micarta Handle Sheath: Black Kydex" COL description VAL "The Fieldcraft Knife was designed by The Brothers of Bushcraft, a coalition of men across North America focusing on sharing wilderness living skills of all categories. From tracking, to building shelters, the Brothers of Bushcraft make it a point to show the skills to all people, of all ages, from all over. The Fieldcraft Knife is the culmination of their knowledge, combining experiences from; the broad and humid rain forests, the arid and scorpion-littered deserts, and the frigid northern lands that span the Americas. The handle is one of the most ergonomic ones on the market, sporting several useful additions. Although knives with a lot of frills often end up lacking, the additional items found on the Fieldcraft knife were selected from experience and critiqued in every step of design, development and production. Being made of canvas micarta, the handle will never let you down. The bow drill divot on the handle is frictionless and makes starting those primitive fires almost effortless. The &quot;Thumb Scallops&quot;, formed on the hilt of the handle offer more comfort and control when using specialized carving and skinning grips. The pommel of the blade is simply the tang of the knife exposed enough to allow impact from a baton to not effect the handle (though the micarta is definitely tough enough to take such abuse). On the exposed pommel, you will find a scraper specially designed by one of The Brothers of Bushcraft, for striking Ferro rods in a safe and efficient manner. The Fieldcraft knife has had heavy duty abuse, and testing done in the wilderness of Canada, where local survival experts Mors Kochanski, Dr. Gino Ferri, and many others have deemed her a &quot;Serviceable Field Knife&quot;. These words are exactly what she is meant to be. The TOPS Knives/Brothers of Bushcraft Fieldcraft Knife will do just about any chore that you can throw at her in a wilderness survival scenario."

COL title VAL "Global G 45 Ceramic Sharpener" COL feature VAL "Maintain the razor-sharp edges of your knives between sharpenings with this easy-to-use ceramic honing rod Lightweight design features ergonomic handle with Globals signature dimple pattern, which provides a stronger grip Oversized hand guard helps ensure your safety 10" length accommodates a wide variety of cutlery, large or small Not for use with serrated or hollow-edged knives" COL description VAL "Also called a Honing Steel. The Global G 45 Ceramic Sharpener is used to hone the blade of kitchen knives. It will maintain a sharp edge with daily use. Despite the name, sharpening steels don't actually sharpen  knives--unless they're diamond steels. Instead, they perform the vital  task of realigning, or resetting, edges, which bend when contacting a  cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool is made of  harder-than-steel ceramic it performs better and quicker than most  steels. Using the sharpener often--before each time a knife is employed  is ideal--prevents a blade from becoming dull and prolongs intervals  between professional sharpenings, or the need of a whetstone or other  true sharpening device. Like Global's signature knife handles, the  ceramic sharpener's handle is molded for comfort and dimpled for a safe  grip. The rule is that a realigning tool should be at least as long as  the knife blade being drawn across it, and this sharpener's 9-1/2-inch  rod is long enough for most household knives. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Global G-38-10 inch, 26cm Diamond Sharpening Steel" COL feature VAL "Solid-core rod hones as well as realigns knife edges Made of chrome/vanadium stainless-steel coated with diamond particles Plated with hard chrome for additional resistance to abrasion 3/4-inch oval exposes more surface for quicker work Stainless-steel handle molded for comfort, dimpled for safe grip" COL description VAL "<ul><li>Dimensions: 4.5 IN x 20.2 IN x 14.2 IN</ul> Although steels often are touted as sharpening tools, few actually sharpen knife blades, but they do perform the vital task of realigning, or resetting, edges, which bend when contacting a cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool's chrome/vanadium stainless-steel rod contains hundreds of thousands of diamond particles, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. Using this steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles. However, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings better than a steel without diamonds because it accomplishes the final task of a professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine point. Exceptionally well made, this tool's rod has a solid core and has been plated with hard chrome for additional resistance to abrasion and to extend its life. Because the rod is a 3/4-inch-wide oval, it exposes more surface and works quicker than a cylindrical rod. Like Global's signature knife handles, the steel's handle is molded for comfort and dimpled for a safe grip. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it, and this steel's 10-inch rod is long enough for most household knives. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

The Harrisville peg Loom kit includes: hardwood 7" X 10" Loom with nylon pegs, cotton warp string, 100% pure wool yarn, plastic needle, and illustrated instructions. Suitable for ages 6 and up. <Br><br>established in 1971, Harrisville is a small, family-owned and operated business. We believe that quality should not be compromised for even the smallest product. Our goal is to preserve and share the textile heritage of our small new Hampshire village, by providing the highest quality materials for easy projects you and your children can make at home. All Harrisville products are 100% Made in the USA. Introduce children to the joys of weaving with this sturdy wooden peg loom, made just for beginners. Easy-to-read instructions with big diagrams make learning a snap. Weavers begin by looping heavy cotton string between the loom's slanted nylon pegs, forming the "warp" of their design. Then, using the long, plastic needle and brightly colored yarn provided, they weave the "weft"--the filling that goes over and under the string--creating designs and holding the piece together. In addition to a sense of accomplishment, children get the chance to practice math and fine-motor skills. They can use this 7.5-by-10-inch loom to create wall hangings, doll blankets, coasters, bookmarks, and more. Winner of the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio's Gold Seal Award. <i>--Joan DeClaire</i>"	1

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

Made from CROMOVA 18 stainless steel, this light knife was created for optimum performance. It was made from a single piece of steel, and has a convex edge for easier slicing. The strength comes from the ice hardening process that reaches a Rockwell degree of C-56-58. It has a wide blade with a thick edge to give you ultimate control. Using this knife feels good on the hands thanks to the hollowed handle and compact design, making it ergonomic for repetitive use. The iconic Global dimple design is on the traditional handle for a nonslip grip. 7" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who like hefty knives, its original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. This knife, however, is relatively heavy. Thick at the back, the broad, 7-inch blade, designed for butchering fish and chopping hard vegetables, carries enough weight to chop through fish bones. For clean, low-friction cutting, the blade is tapered to an edge on only one side so it's even sharper than other Global knives. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Kai Seki Magoroku Kinju ST Japanese Deba Knife 165mm (AK-1102)" COL feature VAL "Material: blade body / molybdenum vanadium stainless steel cutlery, cap / nylon (heat-resistant temperature 90 degrees), handle / laminated wood strengthening Country of origin: Japan Specifications: nylon cap Blade length: 165mm" COL description VAL "Sharp sharpness features.

Although she is dressed in the garb of her deity, a Cretan Earth Mother, she is a personification of Earth from which all life springs and returns. She carries the snakes, symbols of death and rebirth. Crouching on her crown is a lion cub, usually associated with royal houses. In her crown are poppy pods, indicating the use of opium in her worship. The ancient Greek civilization at Crete has provided some of the earliest examples of ancient Greek art.

The pressure exerted by a dogs jaw is considerable, and when directed straight down can put tremendous stress on the teeth. It is recommended that non-edible chews be large enough to encourage chewing from the side rather than the top and bottom. If your dog is between sizes, choose the larger size. If you have more than one dog in your household, select chews appropriate for the largest, strongest chewer. If your dog is an especially strong chewer, a larger chew may provide more of a challenge. Remember to supervise the use of all chews and toys! Nylabone makes both Chew Toy and Edible Chew Products <b>Chew Toy (Non-Edible) Products (Plastic, Rubber and Nylon)</b> are NOT intended for consumption. During normal chewing, tiny bristle-like projections are raised, which help clean teeth. If these tiny pieces (no larger than a small grain of rice) are ingested, they should pass through. A dog should not be able to break off larger piece of any Nylabone chew Toy (Non-Edible). If you think your dog swallowed a large piece of a Chew Toy (Non-Edible), take the chew away and contact your veterinarian for advice. No dog toy or chew is totally indestructible. Frequently inspect any chew before giving it to your dog to make sure its whole and intact, with no missing pieces. Replace a chew Toy when protruding ends are worn down, or if it becomes too small to chew safely. Nylabone Chews and Toys should not be boiled, placed in a dishwasher, washing machine, convection or microwave oven. <b>Edible Chew Products</b> are treats. Their lifespan depends on how determined a chewer your dog is. These all-natural chews are edible and highly digestible. Supervise the use of all Edible chews to ensure that your dog does not bite off pieces too large to swallow. Natural color may stain light-colored surfaces. They are best enjoyed by a dog with all of its permanent teeth (usually around 6 months). Exceptions: Healthy Edibles and Nutri Dent for Puppies 3 months and older. <b>Rawhide</b> is a natural product. It is important that the chew is large and thick enough that a dog cannot easily chew off and swallow a large piece or the whole chew. We recommend discarding rawhide when it has been enjoyed down to a small portion or if it requires more than 5 days to consume. Natural color may stain light-colored surfaces. <b>Edible Puppy Chew Products</b> are designed for puppies 3 months of age and older. Please consult your veterinarian for the right time to start your puppy on edible chews. <b>Puppy Chew Toy (Non-Edible) Products</b> are specially designed for young teething puppies. They should not be given to a dog with ANY permanent teeth, regardless of age."	0

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high- carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge.

With its long, narrow blade, this 9-inch carving knife neatly slices a roast, ham, or turkey into serving portions.

Lamson was established in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts in 1837. As one of the oldest cutlery manufacturers in the United States, Lamson has been the choice of home and professional cooks as well as US Presidents for the last 179 years because of its high standard of craftsmanship. These traditions are true today not only in our cutlery and kitchen tools but in our barbeque equipment, TreeSpirit (Handcrafted North American Hardwood Kitchen Utensils and Wood Care Products) and HotSpot ( Professional Grade Silicone Potholders, Trivets, HotHandles) products. This comprehensive set contains the knives most frequently used in any kitchen, including an 8-inch chef's knife, two 3-1/4-inch parers, and a 6-inch utility, along with several special-use knives that any cook would be relieved to own, such as the 4-inch fruit knife and the 10-inch bread and roast slicer. Each knife features a sturdy high-carbon stainless-steel blade that is hand forged for strength and then brass riveted to its traditional rosewood handle. <P>Blades on LamsonSharp knives are hand honed for extra sharpness, and each has a full tang, which means the blade extends all the way through the handle. This adds heft and balance to the knives. Although the rosewood handles are dishwasher-safe, it is best to hand wash fine cutlery like this in warm, soapy water. The block in this set will protect both the knife blades and the cook's hands, and having one's knives in a block provides an attractive unity to the well-appointed kitchen. <I>--Jill Marquis</I>"	COL title VAL "Bon Home DDR100WH Heat &amp; Dry Dish Rack" COL feature VAL "Heated dish rack dries dishes in about 10 minutes with the touch of a button Whisper-quiet heated airflow for fast results; bacteria-free alternative to towel-drying Accommodates up to 20 wine glasses or 12 dinner plates or a place setting for 6 Slotted 45-degree knife holder; removable drip tray; rubber feet; collapsible design Measures 16 by 20 by 7 inches; 1-year limited warranty" COL description VAL " Quickly dry dishes in about 10 minutes with the touch of a button thanks to this innovative dish rack by Bon Home.

Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you.

The material, design, and construction, are simply the best on the market. Outdoor furniture covers need to breathe so that moisture can escape, keeping mold and mildew from developing under the cover. Koverroos use technologically advanced materials that are one-way breathable - so moisture can evaporate right through the fabric, but water, dust and dirt can-feett get in. Koverroos covers are stronger than most vinyl covers, yet light weight. This means our covers are easy to use - no struggling to get them on and off. Also, these patio furniture covers are able to handle temperatures from -100 degrees Fahrenheit up to +240 degrees. The KoverRoos III 4-feet Garden Seat Cover is appropriate for most weather conditions as it maintains all of the great features of Dupont Tyvek; however, KoverRoos III offers better durability, good for slightly harsher or windier climates. Lightweight and easy to put on and remove, these covers have a soft inner layer that is gentle on your furniture-feets finish. KoverRoos III patio furniture covers score 4 out of 5 in breathability, 5 out of 5 in dirt and dust protection, 5 out of 5 in mold and mildew protection, 4 out of 5 in rain protection, 3 out of 5 in durability, 4 out of 5 in ease of storage, and 4 out of 5 in color retention.

This particular cover comes with a u shaped hook/bungee system (set of 4) attachment system in order to secure the cover in harsher weather conditions and is fitted for an bench or glider less than 51-inch W x 28-inch D x 18-inch H."	0

Professional chefs worldwide trust the tradition and quality of these impressive knives.

Overall Depth - Front to Back: -10.5 Inches. Overall Product Weight: -2 Pounds. The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder? In addition to the Host Guide, eight player's books, and the tape, the package contains a map of the crime scene, secret clues, guest invitations, and nametags. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>"	1

These stoneware pieces features Le Creuset's legendary raised rings and a perfectly matched pallete of signature shades.</h5> <div class="leftImage"><img alt="Dinnerware Stack" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/aplusdiy/B00566OBDA/BandT_20110922_0480.jpg" /><div class="imageCaption"></div></div> Each piece of Le Creuset dinnerware is crafted in the same careful process as all Le Creuset stoneware - with a colorful, durable exterior enamel that matches other stoneware flawlessly while protecting from utensil marks and scratches. Every plate, bowl and mug is designed to complement any collection of stoneware, and is finished with Le Creuset's signature three-ring accent along the exterior. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2 1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary."

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. <strong>About Horizon Fitness</strong><br> Horizon is part of Johnson Health Tech, one of the largest manufacturers of fitness equipment in the world.

The game pieces have been modeled after the main characters from the film: Manny and Ellie (both mammoths), Diego the saber-toothed tiger, and Sid the sloth. The figures are detailed, colorful, and convincing -- certain to charm fans of the movie.<P> Players begin by arranging 24 tiles in a six by four grid at the center of the board. Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play. If they're struggling with the written instructions, they can watch the easy-to-follow video tutorial on the DVD. <P> <b>Interactive DVD Keeps Game Exciting </b><br> The entire game is played alongside the interactive DVD. With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers. For this reason, it's recommended for ages 6 and up.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, game board, 24 double-sided board tiles, 5 game movers, instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL title VAL "Planet Earth DVD Board Game" COL feature VAL "Challenge your family and friends with the unique co-operative game-play.

Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. "Once upon a time, King Kandy, the Imperial Head Bonbon and Grand Jujube of Candy Land disappeared." Thus begins the magical journey of Milton Bradley's classic Candy Land board game. Captivated by the story of a kidnapped king and eager to help find him, little ones move their gingerbread pawns along a rainbow path and through a land of candy characters, all subjects of King Kandy's realm. <P> Playing cards thoughtfully designed for non-readers are coded with colorful squares matching the jeweled stepping-stone path or an occasional token matching one of the characters' symbols: draw a blue card, move to the nearest blue stepping-stone; draw a snowflake and earn a visit to Queen Frostine's iceberg. There are occasional pitfalls, too: land on the wrong square and you might be stuck in Molasses Swamp until a red card is drawn. With all these enticing, sugarcoated images (and King Kandy plainly visible at path's end), children can't help but be delighted by Candy Land. It's delicious!

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

Stainless removable pocket clip included. Designed by Ken Onion. A handsome addition to your kitchen, this all-purpose folding knife is part of Kershaw's Ken Onion collection. The rainbow effect of this knife is caused by a titanium-oxide coating on the stainless steel. The handle underneath the coating is made of 410 stainless steel, while the plain-edge blade is made from Sandvik 14C28N stainless steel. The combination of titanium and steel is designed to make the knife stand up to wear and tear for many years.

The SpeedSafe system features a torsion bar, which, when closed, helps keep the knife closed, preventing it from being opened by gravity. To open the knife, the user must apply manual pressure to the thumb stud to overcome the resistance of the torsion bar. After the blade is out of the handle, the torsion bar moves along its half-moon track and takes over. The blade opens smoothly and locks into position, ready for use. The knife comes equipped with a reversible clip that can be rotated 180 degrees for either tip-up or tip-down carry. Made in the United States, the knife measures 4 inches closed and weighs 3.1 ounces. The blade measures 3 inches. <strong>Manufacturer's Warranty</strong><br> Kershaw products are guaranteed for the lifetime of the original owner to be free of defects when received from the factory.

Figure is based on the charactor from the episode of the Series "When in Rome". Highly detailed removeable cloth outfit and a great likeness of Lucy Lawless. Made by ToyBiz in 1999 and long out of production. Roman Xena from episode "When in Rome". After capturing the ruthless Roman warlord Crassus, Xena and Gabrielle go to Rome to strike a deal with Caesar: Crassus in exchange for freedom fighter Vercinix. Though Caesar purports to accept the trade, Xena knows full well that he will never honor his bargain. Xena realizes that she has put herself in the middle of a political struggle between Caesar and his Roman rival Pompey the Magnus. She devises a plan to free Vercinix by using Caesar's own ruthlessness and political agenda against him. In the meantime, Pompey attempts to enlist Xena's aid in assassinating Caesar, a prospect that the Warrior Princess finds intriguing, for Caesar has caused her nothing but pain and misery, even going so far as to crucify her many years ago. After a brutal round of hand-to-hand combat in the Coliseum, Xena liberates Vercinix and tricks Caesar into executing his ally, Crassus. Ever since actress Lucy Lawless hit television fame in <I>Xena, Warrior Princess</I>, she has attracted twin followings. Some youngsters appreciate her as just another superhero. Feminists find her campy character a rallying point. This collectable Xena may satisfy both audiences. Wearing a long, red gown inspired by the styles worn in ancient Rome, Xena is feminine but fierce. Gold bracelets adorn each movable arm, and a golden crown with a full-length, red veil trails majestically behind her. Tiny, removable gold slippers have gold ribbons that twine up to her knees.

The player with the highest total score at the end of the game WINS! IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Contents: * Folding Game Board * One Die * 49 Polygon Tiles * Game Instructions * 50 Score Cards There's good news and bad news about this board game for two to four players. It's fun to play. It provides useful practice of addition and multiplication facts. It requires strategizing to decide how to play on each turn. That's the good news. The bad news is that the rules are rather difficult to figure out, even for an adult. But keep trying--it's a rewarding and educational game after all. Polygon uses numbered tiles that are placed on the game board in ways that achieve a score for each turn. You can play tiles in several ways so you have to add (and sometimes multiply, too) on each turn, as well as at the end of the game. Polygon is a subtle way to practice those math facts painlessly, so it's a good choice for elementary age kids from third through fifth grades. <I>--Marcie Bovetz</I>"	COL title VAL "The Game Of Chips" COL feature VAL "Fast paced and portable strategy game Makes learning addition facts a blast Designed for 4 to 10 players Comes with easy to follow instructions Recommended for ages 7 and up" COL description VAL "<P><STRONG>From the Makers of the Sequence Game.</STRONG></P> <P>A fun strategy game for the whole family and a great adding game for kids!</P> <P>Roll the dice, then take out any chip combination that matches the total roll of the dice.

Ideal for coaches who want to put their lacrosse players through passing or shooting drills, the STX double-sided training rebounder is versatile and long lasting. The rebounder is equipped with a sturdy A-frame that adjusts to several angles, making it appropriate for single or double-sided use. Just set up the net at the preferred angle and fire away, or put a player on either side of the net to maximize efficiency. The rebounder's nylon surface area--which measures 5 by 3 feet--can also be used for such sports as softball or baseball. The rebounder is an excellent training device for all skill levels. <b>About STX</b><br> STX is the world's leading manufacturer of men's and women's lacrosse sticks and protective gear, including gloves, padding, and women's eyegear. No matter what the product, STX is driven by the same philosophy that spurs every innovation: to create the highest-quality, most-cutting-edge lacrosse equipment available and enable players to reach peak performance on the playing field. This, in turn, raises the standard of play and the specter of America's oldest game and fastest-growing team sport. STX's history traces back to the early 1960s, when the STX founders--lacrosse players themselves--began experimenting with synthetic materials to create a lighter and more resilient stick. Traditional wooden lacrosse sticks were difficult to manufacture, poorly balanced, and hard to maneuver, and often broke due to the physical demands of the game. STX's earliest sticks, by contrast, had a solid double-walled head made of Dupont Adiprene urethane rubber affixed to a hickory shaft. Although crude by today's standards, STX's first synthetic stick went a long way in solving the biggest problems facing the sport. Each stick was now the same weight, balance, and flexibility, because they were made from the same material and same mold every time. In the years since, STX has pioneered nearly every equipment innovation in the game, including such head advancements as the straight double-wall head, the mesh pocket, the pinched sidewall head, and the forward canted head; such gear improvements as the aluminum handle, the composite handle, and the offset handle; and a host of glove and goggle enhancements.

Nao's extensive collection of more than 300 sculptures captures the unforgettable moments of life including motherhood, weddings, childhood, falling in love, the joy of pets, the beauty of nature, religion and much more. Both gift-givers and discriminating collectors alike will appreciate the quality and attention to detail that signifies each and every Nao sculpture. Nao, part of the Lladro group, is sold in more than 122 countries around the world. The demure attitude of the young girl in the Nao So Shy figurine creates a quiet sweetness on a child's dresser or at the front of a china hutch. Though her eyes are downcast, the girl's face and hands are expressive of a charming personality. Her dress flows prettily, and its trim is elaborately sculpted. Moderately weighty yet light in form, the piece is handmade from porcelain in the famous Lladro studios of Spain. Handpainting gives it a delicate palette and a glossy overglaze catches the light for a subtle gleam. A lovely gift or addition to an ongoing collection, the figurine bears the Nao stamp on its underside and stands approximately 7-3/4 inches high. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>"	0

Plug in the transmitter somewhere inconspicuous in your home. The transmitter emits a unique radio signal around your home. Your pet wears a lightweight receiver collar that "listens" for the signal. While the collar is receiving the signal your dog is free to run and play in your yard. When he approaches the boundary of the signal area he will hear a warning tone. If your dog does not return he receives a static correction which is startling but not harmful. With simple training your dog will quickly learn his boundaries - typically within approximately 2 weeks. The training of your pet is a key element with the PetSafe Wireless Fence. Follow the easy instruction and training manual that is included. For use in the U.S. only. This unit is compatible with all US 120V outlets and are not to be used with 220V international voltage. REMINDER: The Wireless Transmitter will be located in the center of the circular containment area. The containment area CANNOT be changed into a square or rectangle shape. A variety of factors, including terrain, topography and metal objects such as automobiles may affect operating range. Contact PetSafe Customer Care if you have any questions before or after your purchase. Spend less time fussing over installation and more time playing with your pup! Short training sessions will have your pets aware of their limits quickly. Plus, our waterproof collars offer 5 levels of static correction (and a tone-only mode) for customized reinforcement based on your dogs temperament. And for trips, the unit is easily portable  just plug it into an outlet! Cover a maximum of 180 feet in diameter or 90 feet in radius, with a minimum of 10 feet in diameter or 5 feet in radius. Plus, you can combine it with additional transmitters to expand your pets play area. Automatic safety shut-off."

Construction: -Seamless construction for easy cleaning. Dimensions: -Dimensions: 8 1/4'' D. Warranty: -Lifetime limited warranty against defects and breakage. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 8-1/4-inch knife for carving meat and poultry is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Global GF-37-8 1/2 inch, 22cm Heavyweight Carving Knife" COL feature VAL "Unique Global GF series for those that want a heavier Japanese knife Face-ground with long taper so edge remains sharp longer Blades made of high-tech CROMOVA stainless steel Face-ground with long taper so edge remains sharp longer Stainless-steel handles are molded for comfort and dimpled for safe grip" COL description VAL "Global heavy weight 8-1/2-inch carving knife This heavy weight Global knife has more heft and a thicker blade than the knives in our classic G series.

The thin and razor sharp Global blade allows the cook to cleanly slice through foods, preserving the integrity of the ingredient and maximizing its flavor.

To balance their knives Global uses a hollow handle that is filled with just the right amount of sand to create the correct balance. The handle has its own unique darkened dimples for a non-slip grip. Global knives have a smooth contour and seamless, all stainless construction that eliminates food and dirt traps. Global knifes are forged in Japan from CROMOVA 18 Stainless Steel, a blend of 18-percent chromium for good stain resistance plus molybdenum and vanadium which gives excellent edge retention."	1

Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings. One player takes the role of Sauron, who is attempting to dominate Middle-earth with his nefarious plots and evil minions. Up to three other players take the roles of heroes who must hold the darkness at bay until Gandalf's plans have matured. To do so, the heroes must embark on dangerous quests and consult with the famous characters of Middle-earth to gain favor and knowledge. Will you play as Sauron and claim Middle-earth as your own? Or will you play as a hero and stand against the Dark Lord? The fate of Middle-earth rests in your hands! It is time of growing darkness and despair. Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord of Mordor, has returned to his ancient fastness of Barad-dur. From there, his evil and corruption has spread across the lands once more. Alas, in the West, there is little strength left. The Elves have all but abandoned Middle-earth, and the blood of Numenor has run thin; that which remains now dwells in Minas Tirith, or with the lonely rangers that haunt the ruins and wild country of Arnor.Yet, there is still hope. Gandalf the Grey has learned that the One Ring, the master-ring which Sauron desires and fears above all, is with the hobbit Frodo in the Shire. And there are heroes! Heroes to aid Gandalf in his hunt for the creature Gollum, and in his quest for the lost knowledge of Isildur's Bane. Heroes, whose strong arms guard the Shire from the enemy. Heroes, who venture into the forests of Ithilien, or even into the Land of Shadow itself, there to disrupt the schemes of Sauron, wherever they may be found.Middle-earth Quest is set in the seventeen-year period between Bilbo's birthday party and the Ring's departure from the Shire, as described in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings.One player takes the role of Sauron, who is attempting to dominate Middle-earth with his nefarious plots and evil minions. Up to three other players take the roles of heroes who must hold the darkness at bay until Gandalf's plans have matured. To do so, the heroes must embark on dangerous quests and consult with the famous characters of Middle-earth to gain favor and knowledge.Will you play as Sauron and claim Middle-earth as your own? Or will you play as hero and stand against the Dark Lord?The fate of Middle-earth rests in your hands!Middle-earth"	COL title VAL "The Lord of the Rings Collector's Chess Set" COL feature VAL "The 32 playing pieces are precise miniature sculptures in fine pewter of the actual cast members and each likeness is so realistic-they were personally approved by the individual actor.

COL title VAL "Electronic Interactive Whac-A-Mole Game" COL feature VAL "Fun for the whole family." COL description VAL ""Come on, slowpoke!" Nine mocking, mining moles peek out of their  holes just begging to get clobbered. A great game for lively little people (and for getting  shy types out of their shells), Whac-A-Mole is just like the arcade  game minus the quarters. A 17-by-25-inch vinyl mat mimics a mole-infested lawn. A  fallen log conceals the controls at one end. You select solo or two-player mode,  choose from three different games and five levels of speed, and you're off! Red and  yellow lights on the moles' hardhats flash randomly; rodents cheer and jeer as you race  to see who can rack up the most direct hits with the plastic mallets. The controller announces the winner after about 30 seconds of play. Whack!--"That smarts! Get me  an icepack!"--it's every gardener's dream. But with those mallets going in all directions,  younger players will need to be careful of each other's fingers. Three AA batteries (not included) required for operation. <i>--Julie Ubben</i>"	COL title VAL "Hasbro Whac a Mole Tower" COL feature VAL "Ring in the fun when you grab your mallet and give the mole a whack!

Featuring goofy mole cartoons, electronic lights, bell sounds, and automatic scoring, this toy is just as enticing as the real thing. Kids can choose from four different games and multiple players can join in the fun. Once the three-piece hinged tower is built, kids press the yellow arrow key until they reach the game they want to play, then press the green check mark.  When the game is announced, it's time to grab the mallet and whack that mole! Although the Whac-A-Mole Tower is easy to set up and loads of fun, there are a few minor design flaws. The tower is constructed out of plastic and our testers weren't completely sure it could hold out against relentless mallet pounding. Also, the cardboard sign on the bell comes tumbling to the ground at the slightest touch. But unless your child is a pint-sized version of Thor, the Whac-A-Mole Tower should withstand rough child play. <P>  <b>Play It</b><br> With four different games to choose from, the Whac-A-Mole Tower offers endless mole-whacking amusement. When playing hammer time, kids try to light up all nine zones in the fastest time. In lights out, players send the mole up the tower to turn off the lights and the game ends when all five areas light up at once. Hit 100 is a game of a different sort, where players must score 100 points in the fastest time, and sometimes players have to send the sliding mole all the way to the top. In 0 to 60, kids compete in a head-to-head challenge and try to be the first to score 60 points. All games can be played with more than one player, so no one will be left out of the group. <P>  <b>Testing the Tower</b><br> Our testers decided to give the mole a whack and see if this toy is as fun as it looks. After a couple minutes spent taking out aggression on the bucktooth mole, it became obvious that this is the ideal kid's toy. Not only do the four games ignite friendly competition, simply trying to get the rodent all the way up the tower is a challenge. Once the tower is turned on, a fast-paced, distracting song plays through the game selection process and during game play. Despite a few minor design flaws, the Whac-A-Mole Tower gives kids the excitement they would find at a carnival, making this toy a great choice for families.

If your pet is out of its cage during the day to play and exercise, the cage can be smaller to accommodate just a sleeping place, food and water. <BR><BR><B>Why we need a sleeping hut</B><BR>A nestbox or sleeping hut is often appreciated although not always absolutely necessary. Many small animals are nocturnal. That means they like to sleep during the day and run around at night. A hut can help your pet feel more comfortable during the sunlight hours while it is sleeping. <BR><BR><B>What kind of decors should I get</B><BR>Scampering around is a favorite activity for most small animals, especially hamsters and mice. An exercise wheel or a variation of the wheel, a spinning disc, is a great choice for smaller pets. Another variation of the exercise wheel is an exercise ball. Your pet can climb into the ball and roll around the floor or on specially made tracks. Your pet can overexert itself; so don't keep it in the ball for more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time. Some small animals, such as ferrets, sugar gliders and rats like to climb on limbs. Climbing branches, bird perches and bird swings work well. They may get chewed up, but that's part of your pet's play, too! <BR><BR><B>Others caring tips</B><BR>Check it's cage for chewed or damaged areas.

COL description VAL "The Messermeister Four Seasons knife collection stands up to the daily challenges and high volume of commercial kitchens. They are die-cut from a single billet of fine German stainless stamping steel alloy and outfitted with colorful, over-sized, molded hygienic handles.

Assembled in Santa Catarina, Portugal by competent craftsmen. You will find yourself using the Messermeister Four Seasons 4 Spear Point Paring Knife daily for a variety of tasks requiring accuracy. This knife has a stamped fine edge blade that tapers to a point and is designed to be an all-purpose knife, similar to a chef's knife, except smaller. The compact blade and molded handle will facilitate trimming, peeling and slicing of produce. For peeling and slicing just about any fruit or vegetable, a good paring knife is one of the most indispensable kitchen tools. This Messermeister Four Seasons 4-inch spear-point paring knife is an especially good choice for those new to the culinary arts who want quality but don't want to spend a bundle. It is made in Germany of a high-carbon stainless steel that combines chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium for tensile strength, hardness, and resistance to corrosion. The full-length tang (meaning the metal blade continues all the way through to the end of the handle) gives you a stronger and better balanced knife. The hygienic polyoxymethelene handle is molded to the tang and will not warp or crack. Although this knife is dishwasher-safe, it's best to hand wash it to keep its steel blade scratch-free. <I>--Doree Armstrong</I>"	COL title VAL "Victorinox Swiss Classic 4-Inch Paring Knife, Spear Tip, Green" COL feature VAL "Made in switzerland by master cutlers Lifetime warranty Dishwasher safe Ergonomic handles are slip resistant The choice of professionals, nsf (national sanitary foundation) approved" COL description VAL "Victorinox Swiss Classic 4-Inch Paring Knife, Spear Tip, Green"	1

Thinner blades for lighter weight giving you more agility with less fatigue. Perfect balance using a weighted hollow handle. No bolster design allowing for full edge use and full-blade sharpening. All stainless steel construction with slip free handle. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges are also ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 10-inch Sashimi slicer is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. And unlike the traditional one-sided sharpened Sashimi knives, this two-side knife, which is ideal for thinly slicing fish and sushi rolls, can be used for both right and left handed chefs. Global also did away with bolsters on its original knives to reduce the weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as the blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between the blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges, and they carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <i>--Fred Brack</i>"	1

It will not raise pH above 8.3 even if inadvertently overdosed. Marine Buffer is a blended product and is not just sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate, commonly sold as a substitute. Such products can raise pH to dangerous levels if not used properly. Marine Buffer contains sodium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and potassium salts of carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, sulfate, and borate."	COL title VAL "Seachem Reef Buffer, 500 grams" COL feature VAL "Raises pH to 8.3 Raises pH and carbonate alkalinity together pK (8.6) allows for greater pH stability in a reef system where the bio load is significantly more than in a fish only system" COL description VAL "Reef Buffer is specifically designed to meet the needs and requirements of the closed reef environment. The principal difference between Reef Buffer and Marine Buffer is that the pK of Reef Buffer is slightly higher than that of Marine Buffer. The pK of a buffering agent is equivalent to the pH around which that buffer most strongly buffers. One would presume, then, that the pK of a saltwater buffer should be 8.3; however, the multitude of organic acids produced by the inhabitants of a reef system forces pH downward to a much greater degree than in a non-reef, marine system. A buffer with a pK of 8.3 would end up yielding a pH more in the range of 8.0-8.2. Reef Buffer's higher pK (8.6) allows for greater pH stability in a reef system where the bioload is significantly more than in a fish only system."	1

COL title VAL "Bachmann Industries McKinley Explorer Ready To Run Electric Train Set Train Car N Scale" COL feature VAL "Complete Ready To Run Train Set Powered by a EMD GP40 locomotive with operating headlight 34" x 24" oval of nickel silver E-Z Track Power pack and speed controller N Scale Train Set Complete Ready to Run Electric N Scale Train Set Everything you need to start your own N Scale railroad EMD GP40 diesel locomotive with operating headlight E-Z Mate Mark II coupler on Tender N Scale 1:160 Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;In.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case,   Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do Not Use Steel Wool To Clean Your Track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition.  Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains.Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended."

The deep drip tray collects the fat so that it doesn't coat your oven, although putting a baking sheet under the roaster is advisable for larger birds. The vertical roaster promotes even cooking, since all sides are exposed to the oven's heat.

It will be the most flavorful and moist chicken you've ever had! Made of quality stainless steel, this roaster begins with a vertical roasting stand that attaches to a large, round drip tray (the stand collapses for easy storage). In the center of the drip tray sits a round dish with cone shaped top. Fill the round dish with herbs, spices, cider, juices or beer; as your chicken rests on the stand, the aromas and flavors from the liquids and herbs pass through the perforations on the cone shaped top, filling the cavity of the bird and adding moisture to the meat as it roasts. Instructions on using the vertical roaster are included. If your last experiment with a vertical roaster led to the bird tipping on its tripod base and landing in the grease pouring out of its cavity, here's a chance to get it right. This Norpro model is versatile enough to serve as a horizontal 13-by-8-1/2-inch rack for roasts. And it easily but sturdily converts to vertical roasting by anchoring up to four hooked pieces to the slats of the flat rack, enabling two birds to roast on this roost, cooking evenly inside and out, with no danger of capon cartwheel. Flipping the bird, so to speak, is a thing of the past--there's no need to pull the rack out of the oven halfway through cooking--and you may as well roast two while you have the heat cranked up (put one in the freezer for next week). Cleanup is fairly easy, too; just be sure to use a nonabrasive sponge or squeegee to preserve the nonstick coating. <i>--Tony Mason</i>"	1

Each knife features a full-tang blade fastened to the handle in the classic three rivet style. Blades are 4.5 inch long, micro-serrated, stamped stainless steel. The micro-serrated edge stays sharp for a long time. Great for slicing steak, chicken or other meats.  Size: 4.5 inch blade length Materials: Stainless steel blades, polypropylene handles Cleaning and Care: Dishwasher safe The eight large, sturdy knives in this knife-and-block set easily slice a thick sirloin steak, a lamb chop, or a pork roast into bite-size pieces and provide the hefty feel suitable for diners with hearty appetites. The 4-1/2-inch blades have serrated edges, so they tend to tear meat fibers rather than slice precisely through them, although their microserrations are finer than most serrated steak knives. Fine serrations mean they stay sharper longer. The handles on these knives are classic three-rivet style with full tangs. Henckels International knife lines are made in countries outside Henckels's home of Germany. These knives come from Japan, don't have bolsters, and are stamped, not forged, from stainless steel that is of lesser quality than Henckels's premier lines. The knives are dishwasher-safe (though they should be hand washed to protect their edges) and carry a lifetime warranty against defects. The wood block is 6-1/2 inches high. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Zwilling J.A.

Gourmet is one of Henckels's inexpensive cutlery lines. These knives don't have bolsters, but that feature isn't vital when confronting a rib eye. The high-carbon, stainless-steel 4-1/2-inch blades are stamped, not forged, and because they are serrated on the upper halves, they tend to tear meat fibers rather than slice precisely through them the way straight-edge knives do.

With a patented reversible blade for sharp or blunt processing, and two speeds of operation, it is well equipped to handle a variety of jobs. <P>Though it has a high-speed motor and durable stainless-steel motor shaft, keep in mind that the Mini-Mate is designed for small amounts of food: 2 tablespoons is the maximum recommended for one batch, and food pieces should be no larger than 1/2 inch.

An instruction book that accompanies the processor details how to process many common foods and troubleshoot problems so you know how to best use and care for your Mini Mate. <P>Cleanup and completion of small jobs is quicker and more efficient because of the small size, though the many parts of the Mini Mate require disassembly, careful cleaning, and reassembly, which does add to total cleaning time.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

From the talents and tastes of three of Europe's Michelin starred chefs comes a new level of stainless cookware. Created in 5-ply stainless, a standard in the world's finest restaurants, the French Chefs fry pan maintains even heat and features riveted handles. Crafted of 5-ply stainless steel. Diameter: 10" The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks with all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between the exterior and an 18/10 stainless-steel interior is a thick aluminum core that spreads heat evenly across the bottom of the pan and all the way up its sides. The interior is 18/10 stainless steel, highly polished so it's stick- as well as stain- and corrosion-resistant. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. This classic, slope-sided frying pan makes clear why All-Clad Stainless is so popular. It's 10 inches in diameter, perfect for searing a hunk of halibut or a hangar steak. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's highest heat. Although Stainless cookware is dishwasher-safe, hand washing is recommended. <i>--Fred Brack</i> <b>From the Manufacturer</b> <br> <b>All-Clad Stainless Construction</b> <br> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cookware/allclad.stainless.gif" width="244" height="129" align="left"> Each piece of All-Clad cookware features a unique metal bonding construction. All-Clad Stainless cookware sandwiches a thick core of three separate layers of aluminum between an easy-to-clean, highly polished 18/10 stainless-steel cooking surface and a magnetic stainless-steel exterior. The aluminum core retains heat and evenly distributes it along the bottom and up the sidewalls of the cookware. The stainless interior is stick-resistant and cleans easily. The magnetic stainless-steel exterior gives the cookware a gleaming finish. All-Clad Stainless also features the companys signature "stay-cool" long handles, lids fashioned from gleaming 18/10 stainless steel, and highly durable stainless-steel rivets. All-Clad Stainless cookware is one of five collections from All-Clad Metalcrafters. Designed to work on conventional gas and electric ranges, as well as induction cooktops, All-Clad Stainless cookware is the best-selling collection in a full line that includes All-Clad LTD, Cop-R-Chef, Master Chef 2, and Copper Core. <b>Features and Benefits</b> <br> All-Clad pans with a stainless interior cooking surface are oven-safe up to 500 degrees. All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include: <ul> <li>Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer. <li>Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you wont have "hot spots" when cooking. <li>Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface. <li>Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles. <li>Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods. <li>Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pans edges to seal in flavor of your foods. <li>The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops. <li>The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface. </ul> <b>Warranty</b> <br> From date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keepers Friend. To use the Bar Keepers Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keepers Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keepers Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

A specially designed sound selector lets you choose ultrasonic frequencies which can only be heard by dogs and cats, or lower sound tones audible to human ears. Bark Free uses an old age principle of "Negative Reforcement using Sound" to help train dogs to stop annoyance barking. Bark Free doesn't attach to the dog and or shock the animal. Bark Free sits on the counter or mounts outdoors. It uses a specially designed speaker that picks up a dog's bark and then sends out a corrective tone to keep Fido from waking you up or the neighbors. Persistent barking and bad behavior in dogs is often difficult to cure. Bark Free is developed by veterinary technicians in the U.S.A. and is a humane and effective way to help address your pet's behavioral problems. When placed near the neighbor's or your own dog, Bark Free is designed to turn on automatically when barking occurs. Bark Free uses a unique "Bark Pickup Sensitivity Adjustment Selector" which allows the user to set the microphone to activate to the dog's bark. This eliminates the chance of any false sound readings and automatically turns off when barking stops.

COL title VAL "Bachmann Trains Village Street Car Set Ready-to-Run On30 Scale Set" COL feature VAL "Street car with headlights and lighted interior 7 Pieces of auto-reversing E-Z Track and 1 Hayes bumper 1 Piece of straight E-Z Track with attached station house Variable speed control Illustrated instruction manual Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;In.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case,   Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do Not Use Steel Wool To Clean Your Track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition.  Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains.Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended."
