Made in Italy, this 1,250-watt machine eliminates the fuss of creating espresso and espresso drinks at home by automating the entire process. With the push of a button, the machine grinds coffee beans without burning them, tamps the ground coffee into the brew group, brews a cup of espresso, and then dumps the spent grounds into a container--all in about 30 seconds. For creating a cappuccino or latte, there's a hot water/steam wand with a milk-frothing attachment. (With this model, there's a 35-second delay from brewing to steaming, and 15 seconds from steaming to brewing.) A button selects one or two cups, and a knob adjusts cup size up to 10 ounces. For safety, the machine shuts off if the grinder runs out of beans or the water tank is empty (control-panel lights indicate specific problems).<P> The machine measures 15 inches high, 13 inches wide, and 13 inches deep; weighs 19 pounds; and, with a gleaming, marble-gray plastic exterior, looks great on the counter.

Optional Miter Slot Adapter (sold separately) allows you to secure Feather-Loc to any 3/8 x 3/4 miter slot. A featherboard is undoubtedly the most underrated router-table accessory of all time. When properly installed, its flexible fingers keep the workpiece pressed tightly against the router tabletop or router fence throughout the routing operation. The result is a dramatic increase in the accuracy, quality and safety of the cuts. Now many woodworkers make their own featherboards from scrap lumber, but heres a better, safer option: the Bench Dog 40-011 Feather-Loc Double Featherboard. This popular router-table accessory consists of not one, but two industrial-quality featherboards. The featherboards are made from a high-tech polymer and each one has 13 angled fingers that apply steady pressure that consistently produces cleaner cuts with less chance of kickback, chattering or lifting. The featherboards slide into miter-gauge slots in the router table or fence, and are locked in place by tightening a pair of knobs. Note that Feather-Loc Featherboards can also be used on a table saw, shaper, bandsaw or any other woodworking machine with a miter gauge slot. -- <i>Joseph Truini</i>\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9996302611296279}

It takes 17 monks to ring the 74-ton bell, 16 of them to raise the giant wooden hammer by pulling it away from the bell with hanging ropes, while the 17th monk rides the hammer, pushing off with his legs in the split second before impact. Ringing the massive bell is an important New Years event and the chiming lasts for 20 minutes. It only takes a gentle breeze to play the Woodstock Chimes of Kyoto and you will have years of pleasurable sounds reminiscent of the Japanese Koto, the musical instrument from which it gets its beautiful tuning.Over 30 years ago, Grammy award-winning musician and instrument designer Garry Kvistad created the first Woodstock Chime from an aluminum lawn chair he found in a landfill. Fascinated by the Scale of Olympos, a 7th century pentatonic scale that cant be played on a modern piano, Garry cut and tuned the lawn chair tubes to the exact frequency of the ancient scale. The resulting Chimes of Olympos was the first Woodstock Chime and is still one of our best selling, musically-tuned windchimes.

Just how does it work? Well, a powerful piston pump removes the air from the patented storage bags and custom containers, then seals them tight. FoodSaver bags have 3 layers of material and special channels so that all the air is suctioned out and can't get trapped in pockets. The bag's outer layer of nylon keeps air from re-entering and spoiling your food. This machine is easy to use and you're certain to find it is a great way to maximize your food's freshness as well as helping your prepare meals ahead, pack for trips and so on. Even first-time users will quickly get the hang of this nifty device. By vacuuming air out of food storage bags, the food inside stays fresher longer--years longer, in many cases. After food is placed in a bag, the edge is laid along the Teflon coated sealing strip and the lid closed. Two hands are required to press down on the top. A choice of two seal times, long and short, ensure that the FoodSavers nylon piston pump vacuums out as much air as desired: longer for wet foods, such as meats, and shorter for dry foods, such as pasta. The machine then creates a wide, tight seal. <P> FoodSavers patented dual-layer bags, made of UV-protective and FDA-approved materials, can be frozen (and prevent freezer burn on foods), microwaved, and boiled. The kit includes three quart-size and two gallon-size bags, along with an 11-inch-by-10-foot roll that can be cut with the built-in cutter to customized lengths and sealed with the Seal Only setting. An accessory port allows the included 30-inch hose to be attached in order to vacuum seal homemade foods in jars, cans, and bottles, or in the kits round, 3/4-quart canister.

The vent pipe is simple to keep clean with a small brush or pipe cleaner, and both the air vent/cover lock and the overpressure plug are removable. The pressure cooker measures 9 inches in diameter (14 inches including handle) and 7 inches tall (including lid). Presto guarantees this pressure cooker with an extended 12-year warranty. A detailed instruction and recipe booklet is included; special safety issues that pertain to pressure cookers are clearly explained. <i>--Garland Withers</i>\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9995635185591677}

This means it provides you with smoother cuts, and it can handle fast feed rates. It's ideal for crosscutting hard- or softwoods that are 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thick, and it also provides good results when cutting plywood and chipboard or when ripping wood. The blade can also handle laminate, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.090 kerf. Plus, because this thin-kerf blade removes less material than standard carbide blades, it wastes less material and requires less horsepower to produce smooth, clean results. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This crosscutting saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide \"crosscut blend.\" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo. With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money. <b>Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat Buildup</b><br>Built to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp. As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or \"pitch\" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and \"face-ground\" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global's original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives, Global also makes a \"heavyweight\" line for cooks who prefer hefty cutlery--like this 6-1/4-inch boning knife, whose stiff blade is as thick as a traditional European knife's and ideal for meat and poultry and cutting through joints. Global also dispensed with bolsters on most of its knives, although this knife has one. Most Global knives have hollow handles, but the handle on this knife is solid. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation.

From the classic \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode of The Simpsons comes the ultimate in possessed playthings: Evil Krusty! Standing 14\" tall, the otherwise well-mannered and beloved TV clown actually has two sides: one good, one evil! Throw the switch hidden in his back, and Krusty switches his five friendly phrases, to five fearful phrases! Krusty features a roto-cast head and plush body, and comes packaged in a window box. Stamped with the Krusty Brand Seal of Approval (so you know it's not just good--it's good enough), this talking Krusty the Clown doll is a fine  re-creation of <I>The Simpsons</I>'s pugnacious Punchinello. Though the box touts him as the one seen in the \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode, this Krusty comes with a surprisingly soft side, along with the uptight demeanor exhibited by his TV counterpart. Three settings on Krusty's back allow you to choose his evil side, good side, or a combination of the two. All in all he has eight sayings, including \"Shut your hole!\" \"You, sir, are an idiot,\" \"What have you done for me lately?\" and \"I'm Krusty the Clown and I love you very much,\" in a voice incredibly similar to the cartoon character. He's dressed in his customary purple shirt, blue bow tie, lime green pants, white gloves, and garishly oversized red shoes. Standing approximately 17.5 inches tall, Krusty has a plush body with a hard plastic head that sports his frightful green 'do, bulging white eyes, and, perhaps the only evil-looking part of him, a wide, toothy grin full of sharp incisors.

The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. You can use this knife for slicing vegetables, chopping meats, or cutting fruits for a healthy fruit salad. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and \"face-ground\" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a \"heavyweight\" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 8-inch chef's knife is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges.

Includes fascimiles of real U.S. money plus tips that parents and teachers can use to connect Moneywise play with the real world. For two players. Created by a volunteer math aide in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Moneywise Kids contains two simple, fun games that will help kids understand how money works, in terms of dollar value and spending power. In the first game, Bill Maker, kids take turns rolling the dice and earning dollars that are commensurate with the numbers that come up: roll a 2 and a 6, for instance, and you get $8. As they accrue wealth with each turn, players exchange smaller bills for larger ones until someone winds up with $100. In the second game, Bill Breaker, each player starts with $100 and earns more money with each turn, but players must also draw \"moneywise markers\"--bills for such real-life expenses as food, medical care, and taxes--and make payments along the way. And watch out for those hard-luck chips that mean big bills. The player who collects all six markers and still has $100 in savings is the winner. The game is lively and only lightly competitive, with an accent on grasping the mysteries of dollars and cents. <I>--Tom Keogh</I>\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9994766243086605}

Show your skills as you dunk over your opponents. Made of lightweight foam, the multi-colored basketball measures 4in. in diameter and is safe to use indoors.

If your little hoopsters have the indoor blues, help them play their favorite sport--and expend some of their boundless energy--with the Poof Breakaway Hoop Set.

This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes it clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 12 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep, which is large enough for a professional kitchen but fully functional in a home kitchen, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for healthful meals. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's heat.

All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include: <ul> <li>Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer. <li>Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides.

Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keepers Friend. To use the Bar Keepers Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keepers Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration.

A revolutionairy combination of advanced filter media and an encapsulated ion particle charging chamber makes it possible for the Blueaur air purification system to achieve better results than either technology alone. Our patented HEPASilent filter technology is proven effective at capturing 99.97% of the tiniest 0.1 micron particles. The quietest unit in the industry, Blueair's low-density filter clean larger volumes of air more quietly than any other unit in the industry. Hence the name HEPASilent(r) a Blueair Exclusive. Bacteria-resistant filters, Blueair's filters are made of bacteria-resistant polypropylene. Because polypropylene is waterproof, the filters naturally reist contamination from bacteria, viruses and mold without chemical additives or washes. And the filters only need replacement every six months, a process that takes under 30 seconds. The Blueair 501 is for room sizes up to 679 square feet.10 year limted warranty, Award-winning Swedish design For rooms up to 679 square feet, this air purification system features two-stage HEPASilent technology that captures 99.97-percent of 0.1 micron particles, including allergy-provoking pollen grains, dust mites, mold spores, and pet dander particles. The unit is ideal for people living with allergies, asthma, or other respiratory conditions, or for anyone who wants cleaner, more breathable air. Particles that a HEPA filter alone might miss are captured with an electrostatic charge. HEPASilent technology moves particles through an enclosed ion chamber, which attaches a charge to the particle itself. Charged particles cling more easily to the filter media, resulting in higher filter efficiency overall. Because most electrostatic air cleaners charge the filter media itself, the charge dissipates over time and renders the filter less efficient. By constantly charging incoming particles, instead of the filter, HEPASilent technology keeps on working effectively. The air purifier's nontoxic polypropylene filter contains millions of ultra-thin fibers that trap tiny particles as they pass through the pleats. One of the least harmful plastics for human health and the environment, polypropylene works without outgassing or shedding irritating microscopic fibers into the air. Because polypropylene is waterproof, the filter resists contamination from bacteria, viruses, and mold naturally, without chemical additives. And as used filters are discarded and decompose, the filter media converts into harmless carbon dioxide and water. Not only does the unit clean air with filters, it&#146;s HEPASilent filter technology also allows for extremely quiet operation. On the lowest setting, the unit emits no more sound than a desktop computer. With its HEPASilent filter technology, particles are trapped with both mechanical and electrostatic filters so that in combination, the two filters create a filter system through which air flows freely and the fan doesn't have to work so hard. The unit's design is also geared towards quiet operation with its noise-muffling steel housing. Not only quiet, but the air purifier is energy efficient as well, costing about the same amount to clean indoor air as it does to power a light bulb--15 watts on low to 95 watts on high. The air purifier operates efficiently, quietly, as well as inoffensively. Instead of discharging a windy stream of filtered air, the unit diffuses air gently through an area six times greater than the average air cleaner. Its SurroundAir system achieves peak performance without annoying drafts by drawing in dirty air from the sides and bottom, moving it through a less dense filter media, and releasing clean, filtered air from the sides and top. Operating on its lowest setting, the system produces virtually no noticeable draft, while still providing an exceptional air exchange rate. The air purifier features a sleek, contemporary, Swedish design and is easy to use and maintain. Simply plug it in, select the speed setting, and it is ready to go, with a bright blue power \"on\" light to show that it's working. The grilles and powder-coated steel exterior are easy to wipe clean, and when the filter needs to be replaced (twice yearly), just open the lid, lift out the old filters, and drop the new ones in. This quiet, efficient, easy-to-use air purifier measures 26 by 20 by 13 inches and carries a 10-year warranty. <i>--Catie Unger</i>\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9996886304750546}

Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

From colonial hearth fires to the campfires of Lewis and Clark, cast iron camp ovens fed the colonists, helped tame the wilderness, and did their share in settling the American West. Cast iron cookware has long been treasures as sought after heirlooms, so much so that, when Lewis and Clark returned from their journey west, their trusted cast iron pots were among the few items making it back to civilization. Like whiskey and tall tales, Lodge Cast Iron improved with age. There are few companies who can boast that products they made over 100 years ago remain in use today, and are still in high demand. You just won't find anyone who knows camp oven cooking like Lodge. Our camp ovens have proven themselves with avid outdoorsmen and patio pioneers from Tennessee to Tokyo. When you create a meal in Lodge Cast Iron, you create a memory that lasts a lifetime. Many of the pieces of cast iron cookware made in the Lodge Foundry over a century ago remain in use today. The Lodge Cast Iron Dutch Oven is a multi-functional cookware that works wonders with slow-cooking recipes. It comes with a tight-fitting lid that helps lock in nutrition and flavor. This pre-seasoned Dutch Oven works like a charm right out of the box. Made of cast iron, this Dutch Oven evenly distributes heat from the bottom through the sidewalls. Also, it retains heat better so your delicious meal remains warm for a long time. Sporting a stylish black color, the cast iron Dutch Oven looks good in most kitchens and it doubles up as an excellent source of nutritional iron. It features loop handles for convenient handling and the oven is easy to clean and maintain. A simple Cast-Iron Dutch Oven, like the one your grandmother used, still ranks as one of the best cooking utensils ever made. It gives you a nearly non-stick surface, without the possible harmful fumes generated by preheating chemically treated nonstick cookware. Many of the pieces of cast iron cookware made in the Lodge Foundry over a century ago remain in use today. Tightly controlled metal chemistry and exacting mold tolerances deliver consistent quality for even heating and superior cooking performance. Heavy gauge wire bale can be used for hanging the oven over the hearth or campfire. Three integral legs allow the oven to be perfectly spaced over hot coals. Flanged to contain hot coals on top so the oven can be used for baking, stewing, and roasting. The versatile lid can be inverted for use as a griddle. The right tool for searing, sauteing, simmering, braising, baking, roasting, and frying. Cast-Iron is a form of cookware developed over a millennia ago remains as popular today as when it was used to prepare meals hundreds of years ago. Cast Iron is one of only two metals compatible with induction stovetops. Unparalleled in heat retention and even heating. At home in the oven, on the stove, on the grill or over the campfire. Skillet may be used on various heat sources including gas, electric and induction. Seasoned cast iron can also be used on the grill or open fire and coals for camp cooking. Begin heating cookware on low and slowly bring heat up to medium or medium/high. Always remove cookware from the stovetop after cooking. Seasoned for a natural, easy-release finish that improves with use. Seasoning is a necessary step in using cast iron cookware. Oil is baked into the pores of the iron at the foundry to prevent rusting and to eventually provide a natural, non-stick cooking surface. Unlike synthetically coated cookware, it is possible to restore the cooking surface of cast iron. Lodge uses a proprietary soy-based vegetable oil to season our cookware. The oil contains no animal fat or peanut oil. The seasoning is functional application and slight inconsistencies may appear in the seasoning finish. The inconsistencies will not affect cooking performance. Easy: hand wash, dry, rub with cooking oil. It is very important to replenish the seasoning of your cast iron cookware by applying a thin layer of oil after each cleaning. Seasoning is an on-going process. The more you use cast iron, the seasoning is improved. Rinse with hot water (do not use soap), and dry thoroughly. Before cooking, apply vegetable oil to the cooking surface of your pan and pre-heat the pan slowly (always start on low heat, increasing the temperature slowly). Once the utensil is properly pre-heated, you are ready to cook. TIP: Avoid cooking very cold food in the pan, as this can promote sticking. PLEASE REMEMBER: Handles will become very hot in the oven, and on the stovetop. Always use an oven mitt to prevent burns when removing pans from oven or stovetop. After cooking, clean utensil with a stiff nylon brush and hot water. Using soap is not recommended, and harsh detergents should never be used. (Avoid putting a hot utensil into cold water. Thermal shock can occur causing the metal to warp or crack). If you are having trouble removing stuck-on food, boil some water in your pan for a few minutes to loosen residue, making it easier to remove. Towel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to the utensil while it is still warm. TIP: Do not let your cast iron air dry, as this can promote rust. Store in a cool, dry place. If you have a cover, or lid, for your utensil, place a folded paper towel in between lid and utensil allowing air to circulate. This prevents moisture from collecting inside the utensil, which can cause rust. TIP: The oven is a great place to store your cast iron; just remember to remove it before turning on the oven. NEVER wash in dishwasher. If for some reason your utensil develops a metallic smell or taste, or perhaps rust spots (maybe a well-meaning relative washed your utensil in the dishwasher or with soap thinking they were being helpful), never fear. Simply scour off the rust using a very fine grade of sandpaper or steel wool and refer to our section on re-seasoning. While maintaining the seasoning should keep your Cast Iron in good condition, at some point you may need to repeat the seasoning process. If food sticks to the surface, or you notice a dull, gray color, repeat the seasoning process: Wash the cookware with hot, soapy water and a stiff brush. (It is okay to use soap this time because you are preparing to re-season the cookware). Rinse and dry completely. Apply a thin, even coating of MELTED solid vegetable shortening (or cooking oil of your choice) to the cookware (inside and out). Place aluminum foil on the bottom rack of the oven to catch any dripping. Set oven temperature to 350 &#xFFFD; 400 degrees F. Place cookware upside down on the top rack of the oven. Bake the cookware for at least one hour. After the hour, turn the oven off and let the cookware cool in the oven. Store the cookware uncovered, in a dry place when cooled. For over 112 years, Lodge has provided quality cast iron cookware and accessories, with a broad and innovative assortment. Our continued commitment to quality enables Lodge to offer a superior product line. We measure from outside rim to outside rim across the top of the cookware, not the bottom. We recommend using wood or silicone utensils to avoid scratching. Soap and detergent are used to break down and remove oils. Since the seasoning of your cast iron consists of oil, cleaning with soap will strip or remove the seasoning from cookware. Foods which are very acidic (i.e. beans, tomatoes, citrus juices, etc.) should not be cooked in a cast iron utensil until the cookware is highly seasoned. The high acidity of these foods will strip the seasoning and result in discoloration and metallic tasting food. Wait until cast iron is better seasoned to cook these types of foods. Lodge is a zero hazardous waste stream foundry. Lodge designed a vegetable oil recycler for the seasoning process to reduce waste and unusable oil is recycled and used as biodiesel generator. Lodge uses recycled and biodegradable packing materials. Reuse of foundry sand used in the casting process is recycled and unusable sand, working to purify the water of the local streams and planting trees to improve air quality and beautification. Lodge is the oldest family-owned cookware foundry in America. Since 1896, the Lodge family has been casting premium iron cookware at their Tennessee foundry. Starting with raw materials and finishing with their seasoning process, they continue to improve on the highest quality standards that go into every piece we make. As the sole American manufacturer of cast iron cookware, they are proud to carry on the legacy started by founder Joseph Lodge. Lodge doesn't just make cast iron; they make heirlooms that bring people together for generations.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Camp Chef Deluxe 9 1/3-Quart Dutch Oven\" COL feature VAL \"Seasoned Cast Iron is ready to cook and easy to maintain Deep Dish Lid increases air flow for even cooking;doubles as a skillet or serving trivet Thermometer Channel,Check temperature without removing lid.

The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. To ensure an ideal cutting angle, the laser-controlled edge is incredibly sharp and is honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans. The three-rivet handle embedded with the ZWILLING J.A. Henckels logo provides optimum durability. This knife block set carries a useful assortment of standard knives for outfitting a kitchen. The set includes a 2-1/2-inch peeling knife, a 4-inch paring knife, a 5-inch serrated utility knife, a 6-inch utility knife, and an 8-inch chef's knife, as well as a 7-inch hollow-edge santoku, an 8-inch bread knife, and a 4-1/2-inch steak knife. A 9-inch sharpening steel keeps their edges in order, and a pair of kitchen shears to snip herbs, flowers, or string is also included. Everything stores neatly in the attractive natural hardwood block. The knives feature high-carbon, stainless-steel blades that have been stamped from one piece of metal. The edge is cut by laser for a more consistent angle on the blade and hand-honed for sharpness. Blades have also undergone Henckels's Friodur ice-hardening process, which further strengthens them and protects from discoloration. The ergonomically designed traditional-style polymer handles are securely fastened to the balanced full tangs with three rivets. Handles seamlessly encase the tangs on these knives so no food particles can ever become trapped in a gap.

This set capitalizes on the popularity of the \"breakaway rim\" concept and can be bent when a player dunks a basketball and it instantly snaps back into position once released. Show your skills as you dunk over your opponents. Made of lightweight foam, the multi-colored basketball measures 4in. in diameter and is safe to use indoors. Since the hoop is lightweight and uses a screwless door mount, this set can be moved from door-to-door, stored when needed or taken anywhere you go. All you need is a door to experience great basketball action. Includes a breakaway rim, backboard, net and 4in. foam basketball. Recommended for children 5 years of age and older. Don't let a little rainy weather break up those backyard basketball games. If your little hoopsters have the indoor blues, help them play their favorite sport--and expend some of their boundless energy--with the Poof Breakaway Hoop Set. The easy-to-assemble basketball hoop attaches to a bracket that hangs over a door without damaging it; or, if you prefer, mount the hoop on a wall using four half-inch screws (not included). True to its name, the hoop snaps down when weight is applied, so young NBA imitators won't be tempted to try and shatter the (cardboard) backboard during a dramatic slam dunk. Includes a red, white, and blue net and a 4-inch mini basketball in soft foam. <I>--Lisa Whipple</I>\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9915215980653226}

B models have three burners, and C models have three burners and a side burner. All models feature a unique, patented Flavorizer bar cooking system, patented hanging LP fuel scale (LP models only), two granite-style thermoset work surfaces, Crossover ignition system, solid robot-welded carts, and a double-walled stainless steel hood. Stainless steel is a very durable choice of materials, but intense heat will cause it to discolor. Weber engineers solved this problem with a double-walled design. Air trapped between the walls insulates the handsome brushed stainless exterior maintaining its showroom condition. All Genesis Gold models also feature Weber's Stop Watch Engineering because the last thing you want is a hassle putting your grill together. Now all it takes to get your grill together is ten minutes, no more than eight fasteners, and a single tool. We even throw in the tool. All propane models include a 20-pound propane tank. All models also feature a limited lifetime warranty. At first glance, Weber gas grills look like something that might be shot into space or driven in a Formula 1 race rather than the sleek cooking machines they really are. This is an understandable mistake, because with its Genesis series of grills, Weber has made the time-honored tradition of outdoor cooking state-of-the-art, virtually putting an entire kitchen at your fingertips and on your patio. The Genesis Gold C features a generous 611 square inches of total cooking area, which includes the primary cooking area, a warming rack, and a warm-up basket. Its three stainless-steel burners supply an input of 39,000 Btu's per hour and provide 550-degree broiling temperatures without wasting fuel. The Genesis Gold C also features a side burner, rated at 10,000 Btu's per hour, that is perfect for creating a side dish to accompany your perfectly cooked main course. In place of the lava rock, pumice stone, or flat metal plates found in most common gas grills, Weber grills feature the company's patented Flavorizer bars, which do not retain dripped fats. Instead, juices sizzle and smoke when they hit the Flavorizers, eliminating potentially disastrous flare-ups and imparting a delectable smoky flavor to your feast. Getting the grill ready to cook that feast doesn't take long, either. Weber's Crossover ignition system enables you to effortlessly start all three burners, which have been positioned to heat your food evenly. A dual-purpose thermometer included in the front of the grill unit measures the temperature under the double-walled stainless-steel hood; it can also be removed and used as a meat thermometer to ensure a thoroughly cooked meal every time. And you won't need to scramble for seasonings (or recipes--Weber provides a cookbook) or use a separate table while cooking, thanks to several convenient features. In addition to the handy work surface on one side of the unit, a wire condiment basket hangs along the front of the grill, keeping condiments, spices, marinades, or other barbecue necessities close at hand. A wire shelf is situated beneath the grill and stretches the length of the unit, and three wire tool hooks hang below the work surface, ready for your spatula, meat fork, and basting brush. Weber natural gas grills also come with a 12-foot quick-disconnect hose. With its lid open, the Genesis Gold C measures 61-1/2 inches tall, 69-1/2 inches wide, and 33 inches deep. This powerful cooking machine is easily moved, however, thanks to its crackproof all-weather wheels and locking casters, which prevent it from moving when you're cooking. While a grill cover is recommended to protect your grill from the elements, Weber's engineers did take outdoor storage into consideration and, with the help of entomologists, added special spiderproof screens to prevent the burner tubes from being clogged by cobwebs or nests. This grill features Weber's Stop Watch engineering. Now it takes approximately 10 minutes to assemble your grill with no more than eight fasteners and a single tool. Weber even throws in the tool.

From Kenner.   Nicknamed \"Sir Charles\" and \"The Round Mound of Rebound\", Barkley established himself as one of the National Basketball Association's (NBA's) most dominating power forwards. He was selected to the All-NBA First Team five times, the All-NBA Second Team five times, and once to the All-NBA Third Team. He earned eleven NBA All-Star Game appearances and was named the All-Star MVP in 1991. In 1993, he was voted the league's Most Valuable Player and during the NBA's 50th anniversary, named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. He competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States' Dream Team. In 2006, Barkley was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.  Barkley competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States men's basketball team. International rules which had previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed in 1992, allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The result was the legendary Dream Team, which went 60 in the Olympic qualifying tournament and 80 against Olympic opponents. The team averaged an Olympic record 117.3 points a game and won games by an average of 43.8 points. Barkley led the team with 18.0 points on 71.1% field goal shooting and set a then-Olympic single game scoring record with 30 points in a 12783 victory over Brazil. He also set a U.S. Men's Olympic record for highest three point field goal percentage with 87.5% and added 4.1 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Gizmo Supply 10 Person Dome Camping Tent\" COL feature VAL \"10-person family dome tent with extra-spacious interior Sewn-in divider creates 2 distinct living areas 2 side rooms with divider curtains for extra storage Pin-and-ring system for easy setup; full mesh ceiling 4 windows; measures 17.5 x 7 x 14 feet (W x H x D)\" COL description VAL \"Measuring 17.5 by 14 feet, the large Swiss Gear Montreaux Family Dome Tent will sleep up to ten people.

Bacterial diseases are caused mostly by dirty aquarium conditions and the addition of infected fish. Fish that are injured and have open wounds are especially susceptible, even in seemingly clean tanks. Bacterial infections, like fin and tail rot, eye cloud, pop eye, body slime and mouth fungus destroy tissue and other organs, and if left untreated, can cause death.

Just add 5 ml per 10 gallons of aquarium water. It will not adversely affect the biological filter, alter the pH or discolor the water. For effective treatment, dose infected fish daily for 7 days, and continue afterward if necessary. Dose new fish daily for 3 days. Remove activated carbon from filter before use, if possible.

Radio-controlled by the national atomic clock in Colorado, the clock resets daily to the hour, minute, and second for continued accuracy. Additionally, the clock adjusts automatically for daylight savings time. Equipped with a thermometer and a hygrometer, the clock also assesses and relates temperature and humidity levels to help users protect seedlings from frost, avoid over-watering finicky plants, and take precautions against an icy walkway. Surrounded by a sleek pewter metal frame, the clock face features black 1-1/6-inch-high numbers for easy visibility. Elegant, black metal hands tick off the hours and minutes. For temperature and humidity readings, the clock face displays two small analog gauges. The hygrometer gauge measures from 1 to 99 percent relative humidity, while the temperature gauge gives readings for temperatures from -10 to +130 degrees Fahrenheit, or -30 to +60 degrees Celsius. On the backside of the clock, the user selects the appropriate US time zone; the clock accommodates Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific times. A manual reset button is provided. To ensure accurate readings, hang the clock in a dry area out of direct sunlight. This clock requires the separate purchase of one AA battery for operation with an optional compartment (2 additional) to extend life of power. Whether mounted indoors or outdoors, this 18-inch round analog wall clock reports the time, temperature, and humidity at a glance. This clocks claim to fame is its precision time-keeping and the fact that it never needs to be set. A built-in antenna system receives signals from the WWVB radio transmitter in Fort Collins, Colorado, which is in turn regulated by the atomic clock. Once you install the battery and choose one of four U.S. time zones, the clock automatically sets to the accurate time in hours, minutes, and secods, and continues to adjust itself six times daily. This low-maintenance clock even automatically adjusts for daylight savings time, so you never need to remember to spring ahead or fall back. As an additional perk, the clock features in the lower left area of the face a hygrometer that measures the percentage of relative humidity in the air. The lower right has an analog thermometer that reports the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. This radio-controlled clock is covered by a 1-year warranty and runs on one AA battery (not included). <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>\"", "match": "0", "match_confidence": 0.9987005725342086}

Otherwise Grand Prix knives are identical to other W&uuml;sthof knives, embodying all the virtues that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. The blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as on some knives. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. The four knives in this set exemplify control while providing a cook with the essentials: an 8-inch cook's knife (chef's knife) for rocking through chopping and mincing tasks; a 6-inch sandwich knife for myriad slicing and cutting needs; a 7-inch serrated bread knife for crusty loaves; and a 3-1/2-inch paring knife for fruits and vegetables.

The three-pronged base provides stability equal to models with center posts, but instead of one central handle there are two ring-style side handles.

Olson</i> <strong><font color=\"#cc6600\"><big>Five Tips for Buying Door Hardware</big></font></strong><br>Theres nothing that enhances style and function quite like new door hardware. Its the first thing that catches the eye at the front door, and it feels good in hand throughout the home. Here are five tips to simplify the buying process. <font color=\"434242\"><b>What are the different types of door hardware?</b></font color=\"434242\"><br><ul><b>Entry</b> hardware installs on exterior doors, and includes knobs or handlesets (handle with deadbolt) that lock with keys or touch pads from the outside and turnbuttons from inside. A deadbolt lock optimizes security.<br> <b>Privacy</b> hardware is designed for bedrooms and bathrooms, locking with turnbuttons and not requiring keys.<br> <b>Passage</b> knobs and levers are designed for hallway doors, laundry rooms and closet doors that latch but dont lock.<br> <b>Dummy</b> knobs and levers are decorative hardware pieces designed for pantry doors or other doors that only require a pull to open, with no latch or lock.</ul> <font color=\"434242\"><b>What safety features are available? </b></font color=\"434242\"><br> The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) sets different grades for door hardware, such as Grade 1 (basic), Grade 2 (intermediate), and Grade 3 (highest). These days, with more and more intruders using \"bump keys\"--a key that can open almost any lock--or locksmith tools once intended only to resolve accidental lockouts, many manufacturers offer bump-resistant cylinders. <font color=\"434242\"><b>Will it fit my door?</b></font color=\"434242\"><br><ul><li>Standard doors are either 1-3/8 or 1-3/4 inches thick, with most hardware designed to adjust for either. Extension kits are available for thicker doors.<table align=right width=250 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td align=\"center\"> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/backset_large.jpg\" TARGET=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/backset_small.jpg\" border=0 align=top></a><br><small><i><b> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/backset_large.jpg\" TARGET=\"_blank\" onclick=\"\"window.open(this.href,hull,'width=674,height=420'); return false;\">View larger</a></b></i></small> </td> </tr> </table> <li>Most hardware is interchangeable, only requiring that the <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/backset_large.jpg\" TARGET=\"_blank\" onclick=\"\"window.open(this.href,hull,'width=674,height=420'); return false;\">backset</a> (the distance from the edge of the door to the center of the knob or lock, usually 2-3/8 or 2-3/4 inches) matches the hole(s) in the door so that the latch or bolt throws properly. Some hardware sets adjust for both backset lengths. <li>Levers come in both left- and right-handed models. To determine the appropriate handing, look at the doors hinges from outside the door. If the hinges are on the left, youll need a left-handed lever. If the hinges are on the right, you need a right-handed lever.</ul> <font color=\"434242\"><b>Can I install it myself?</b></font color=\"434242\"><br>Most door hardware, including keypads and deadbolts, installs in under an hour with only a Philips screwdriver. Most keypads are powered by batteries, so no wiring is required. Handlesets sometimes require a drill. If the door or doorframe is not predrilled, door hardware usually comes with a paper template to mark holes for drilling and sawing with common spade bits and hole saws. Specialized tool sets also are available for door-hardware installation. If you want to use one key on multiple entry handles or deadbolts, you will need a locksmith to \"re-key\" all the locks to the same key. This should be done before installation and only will work if all the hardware comes from the same manufacturer. <font color=\"434242\"><b>What cool hardware features are available nowadays?</b></font color=\"434242\"><br>Keypad locks and deadbolts let you add and delete numerous user codes as needed, providing family members, neighbors, baby- or pet-sitters with easy-to-remember codes. Cool for parents and great for keeping kids out of cleaning closets and utility rooms, some keypads have auto-lock mechanisms that lock after a few seconds in case you forget.<br>Once used only for government applications (as depicted in high-tech spy movies), biometric keyless entry systems, which scan dozens of different fingerprints for easy access, also are growing in popularity.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Chroma # 800 Medium Grit whetstone\" COL feature VAL \"Medium stone use for everyday sharpening.

It is much stronger than competing products and is safer too. Some competing products contain toxic formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is more toxic than ammonia, and if too much is used, the results can be disastrous. Ammonia Detox is safe, even when overdosed. It neutralizes ammonia, chlorine and chloramine, instantly preparing tap water for immediate addition to the aquarium. Unlike some similar products, Ammonia Detox is even safe for sensitive hard and soft corals, anemones and other invertebrates, as well as freshwater and marine fish and plants. Use when preparing tap water for new aquariums, making water changes, or adding water to make up for evaporation. Ammonia Detox is safe to use directly in all freshwater and marine aquariums, including coral mini-reefs and also water gardens to neutralize toxic ammonia, as well. If the bacteria bed of an aquarium is accidentally killed by overuse of antibiotics, or other factors, Ammonia Detox will bind toxic ammonia, providing time to relocate the fish and invertebrates or to obtain other filtration media. In cases where too many fish are added too quickly, Ammonia Detox will bind ammonia until the existing bacteria multiply sufficiently to handle the ammonia. Ammonia Detox is also valuable for binding nitrites in fry rearing systems, where filtration cannot be used.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Zoo Med T-8 Flora Sun Max Plant Growth Fluorescent Bulb\" COL feature VAL \"Lasts up to 10,000 hours Can save $30 per year over T-12 bulb Promotes maximum photosynthesis\" COL description VAL \"This high intensity lamp with peak emissions in the blue and red regions serves to maximize the photo biological processes in plants.

The following is a brief summary of each glove's characteristics:<br> <ul> <li><b>Catcher:</b> No finger channels, with heavy palm padding and overall reinforcements to reduce the sting of repeatedly catching pitchers' throws <li><b>First Base:</b> Also lacks finger channels, but with less padding that a catcher's mitt, with added length to help catch infield throws and shallow pocket, enabling quick ball retrieval <li><b>Infield:</b> Five-fingered glove has shallow pocket for fast ball retrieval, with nine- to 10-inch youth sizes and 10.5- to 11.5-inch adult sizes, and softball infield gloves having a deeper pocket to accept the larger ball<br> <ul> <li><i>Second base</i> players require smaller gloves to balance control with the need to make quick throws <li><i>Shortstops</i> use a mid-sized glove for ground balls and quick throws <li><i>Third base</i> players need a larger glove for maximum catching power </ul> <li><b>Outfield:</b> Glove is longer to provide extended reach, with a deep pocket to handle high-lofting balls, and sizes range from 12 inches and up for adults and 11 inches for youth players <li><b>Softball Gloves:</b> The characteristics, by position, of softball gloves are typically similar to their baseball counterparts, with softball gloves having more length and deeper pockets to handle the larger ball </ul> <b><font color=CC6600>Anatomy of a Glove</font></b><br> Gloves are designed to perform a relatively simple task--catch a ball. The quality of materials and craftsmanship that can go into a building a glove, however, can be surprising. Below is an overview of a glove's components and how each helps optimize your defensive game:<br> <ul> <li><b>Pocket:</b> Pocket depth is determined by player position, with shallower pockets helping infielders quickly retrieve and throw the ball, and outfielders' pocket depth aiding in capturing a ball on the fly. Softball players also need deeper pockets to catch the larger ball. <li><b>Webbing:</b> The preferred webbing pattern is partly determined by field position and partly by player preference. Generally, open webbing helps infielders quickly retrieve the ball, closed or tightly woven webbing gives outfielders and third basemen extra support, and closed webbing allows pitchers to hide the ball from the batter. <li><b>Backs:</b> The back of a glove, or the part that goes across the top of your hand, can either be closed or open, which is largely a matter of player preference. Some infielders find an open back to be more flexible and forgiving, while outfielders may like a closed back with finger hole for added support. <li><b>Wrist Adjustment:</b> Some gloves include fit systems, or wrist adjustments, to help keep the glove tightly affixed to a player's hand. The most popular closures are buckles, D-rings, lacing, and Velcro. <li><b>Padding:</b> How padded a glove's pocket is depends on position, with catcher being the most heavily padded. In recent years, many manufacturers have begun to add padding to other position gloves to reduce \"palm shock.\" <li><b>Materials:</b> By and large, gloves are constructed using one of three materials--leather, treated leather, or synthetic--with the differences relating to feel and durability. <ul> <li><i>Leather:</i> Most high-end gloves are made of leather, which offers optimal feel and durability, with leather quality being a significant cost driver <li><i>Treated Leather:</i> Leather material is softened and strengthened during production for quicker break-in, better durability, and lower maintenance <li><i>Synthetic:</i> A lower-cost alternative to leather that offers reduced durability and responsiveness, and is a good option for beginning players </ul> </ul> <b><font color=CC6600>Fits Like a...</font></b><br> As mentioned above, age and position are the most significant factors in selecting a proper glove size. Outfielders need larger gloves with deeper pockets for maximum \"catchability,\" while infield gloves are smaller and have shallower pockets for optimal control and speedy ball removal. Some pitchers opt for infield gloves that are slightly larger than standard, yet small and shallow enough for rapid fielding and throwing. Most younger players will benefit from youth-sized gloves that help with control, and it's a good idea to resist the temptation to buy a larger glove the child will grow into. The tables below offer a general guideline for proper glove size by sport, position, and age. <table width=\"400px\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border:1px #000 solid; text-align:center;\"> <tr> <td colspan=\"3\" valign=\"left\" style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;

Its 'sure grip' and well-balanced design combine with a soft trigger to reduce arm fatigue. And because you won&rsquo;t have to drag a hose with you as you work, you&rsquo;ll be able to drive nails better and longer, without undue stress on your arms, hands, and wrists. <b>Compact, Heavy-Duty Design Works Anywhere and Everywhere</b><br>Compact enough to work in tight, hard-to-reach areas, the IMCT Framing Nailer packs a powerful punch with heavy-duty construction that can handle tough job conditions. It shoots up to 1,200 nails on a single fuel cell and up to 4,000 nails on a full battery charge, providing a cycle rate of two to three nails per second. And because it offers tool-free depth-of-drive adjustment--no wrenches required!--you can get more done in less time. <b>Internal Combustion Linear Motor for Robust Performance</b><br>Unlike other power fastening tools, the IMCT Framing Nailer is powered by an internal combustion linear motor. In simpler terms, the nailer owes its robust performance to its motor, which is similar to an automobile's motor. Additionally, the tool ignites a fuel and air mixture to produce the energy needed to drive the motor, and ultimately, the fastener. <b>Patented Battery System for Consistency and Reliability</b><br>Another unique feature of this nailer is that it uses a patented system that requires both a fuel cell and a rechargeable battery (the fuel cell is not included). This translates to optimum consistency and reliability, whether you&rsquo;re building a deck, working with wall sheathing, or repairing a roof. It also means the IMCT Framing Nailer is entirely self-contained. The tool carries its own fuel supply and battery--along with a supply of fasteners--making it easy to bring with you from site to site. <b>Lockout Feature to Prevent Blank Firing and Wood Damage</b><br>The IMCT Framing Nailer boasts a lockout feature to prevent needless blank cycling, which can waste fuel and damage both the wood you&rsquo;re working with and the nailer's components. This feature works by ensuring that five nails will be left in the magazine when the follower reaches the lockout area. Additionally, the tool will not operate when its nail supply has less than six nails. <b>High-Visibility Magazine and Belt Hanger for Convenience</b><br>The IMCT Framing Nailer is designed to be exceptionally user friendly, with features that help keep your job running smoothly. First, the load magazine is highly visible, so it helps prevent you from running out of nails in the middle of a project. There&rsquo;s also a convenient dual-position belt hanger, so you don't have to lay the nailer on the ground or on top of a ladder, nor do you have to wedge it among rafters. And if you can't remember where you last placed your nailer, its bright orange color makes it easy to spot. <b>About the Battery Charging System</b><br>The IMCT Framing Nailer comes with a rechargeable battery and its own charging system. This charging system is the only one that will work with Paslode batteries (both round and oval). When your tool arrives, you&rsquo;ll first need to charge the battery. Batteries will generally take five minutes to two hours to recharge, depending on the amount of discharge within the battery. <b>Dimensions and Warranty Information</b><br>The IMCT Framing Nailer has a height of 14.5 inches and weighs 7.3 pounds. It comes with a one-year limited warranty on all parts, a five-year warranty on all molded nylon parts, and a 90-day limited warranty on the bumper, driver blades, O-rings, and seal rings. <b>What's in the Box</b><br>Nailer, 6.0-volt battery, charger, belt hanger, rugged plastic carrying case, safety goggles, manual, and 5/32-inch hex wrench.<br clear=\"all\"><table align=\"center\" width=\"750\" cellpadding=\"10\"><tr><td><center><br><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/content_26/Q2_2009/paslode-B0000225HU-3-sm.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br><br><font size=1><font face=\"Verdana\"><em><b>The IMCT Framing Nailer is designed to for easy handling and reliable, professional performance.</b></em></font></center></td></tr></table><br clear=\"all\">\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Grizzly G0529 Oscillating Spindle/Disc Sander, 12-Inch\" COL feature VAL \"We've combined the precision of an Oscillating Spindle Sander and a 12-Inch Disc Sander The Spindle Sander features 4 spindle sizes which utilize sleeves of sandpaper for easy changing availability and low cost The direct drive 1725 RPM 12-Inch Disc Sander yields excellent control without burning the work piece\" COL description VAL \"We've combined the precision of an Oscillating Spindle Sander and a 12\" Disc Sander for the ultimate and most useful combination sander on the market today.

The ergonomic polypropylene handle lies comfortably in your hand, facilitating strain-free use; the metal bolster acts as a finger-guard; and the blade, bolster, and tang are fused into a seamless piece for easy handling and balance. The absence of rivets and recesses in the synthetic handle allows for dishwasher use. Finally! Still, the best way to care for this knife is to hand wash it with a mild soap, rinse it well, and then immediately wipe it dry. <i>--Marcela Broussard </i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fivestar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> The TWIN Five Star range is a masterful blend of sharpness and ergonomic design.

The saw crosscuts up to 12-1/4 inches, handling two-by-twelves with ease. With a 3-7/8-inch maximum depth miter cut, the saw also cuts four-by-four material in one pass--a feature deck builders, in particular, will appreciate. Both rails are self-cleaning and ride on linear ball bearings. The horizontal rail design also seems to give this saw some extra stability, a feature that's particularly important in a 12-inch saw that bevels to 45 degrees both ways. Makita's saw has a vertical grip design with a thumb-activated safety switch and a paddle trigger, and while the vertical design might be slightly less ergonomic than the horizontal D-handle, it does allow you to use the saw comfortably with either hand. Plus, the paddle grip makes squeezing the trigger easy no matter how you're holding the handle. The saw's nine positive stops make it easy to lock in common miters, too, and they're deep-cast into the body of the saw, so it's hard to imagine they'd ever develop slop. The miter lock on this saw has an older screw-handle design, which is a little more time-consuming than a new (more expensive) cam-lock design. We really like the electric brake, though, a user-friendly feature that makes a big difference, especially when a job requires a lot of constant, repetitive cuts. The pivot fence adjusts for supporting large stock and flips back for bevel cuts. The saw also comes with a well-designed work clamp that lets you make precision cuts on small pieces without having to get your fingers too close to the blade. Like most sliders, this saw features a depth-stop mechanism in case you have to make a few quick dado cuts on a job site. And, for home shop users, this saw has the added option of a release safety button that pulls out and locks the saw off. <I>--Jon Groebner</I> This Dual Rail Slide Compound Saw from Makita is efficient and precise. Its two-pole, linear, ball-bearing-mounted, sliding cutting head ensures the ultimate in cutting accuracy. It performs precision bevel cutting up to 45 degrees, both left and right, and miters up to 60 degrees right. It has positive stops at 15, 22.5, 30, and 45 degrees left and right.

The Dino Math Tracks game (winner of several prestigious awards, including an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Seal) is a race around the rainbow with a pack of pintsize, prehistoric pals. An unusual spin on a typical roll-the-dice-and-move game, it spotlights the mathematical concept of <i>place value</i> and gives kids reinforcement in what makes our base-10 number system tick. Each player is allotted one dinosaur for each of the four tracks (the tracks are labeled 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s). To play, a player rolls four dice to create a 4-digit number and then moves his or her prehistoric posse to the appropriate 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s places. Problem-solving strategies are honed as players scurry to get all four miniature mammoths or tiny triceratops into the dino haven, ahead of the other players' thundering herds. But look out! In the race to dino utopia, it's easy to get bumped by a baby brachiosaurus! The Dino Math Tracks game provides multiple levels of play for a variety of ages. At the simplest level (perfect for a first-grader who knows Arabic numerals and one-to-one correspondence), kids use only the place track for the 1s. Later, cards with simple problems are introduced (\"Stuck in a tar pit! Move your 10s dino back two spaces!\"). At the most advanced level, players might encounter a question like this: \"Your 10s dinosaur forgot its pants, so it went back 15 to get them. Then it hurried forward 25. How far did it get? Move that many.\" Young players will find the 2-inch, spunky vinyl dinosaur playing pieces irresistible. The game offers plenty of opportunities for friendly competition and brain bending--not to mention lots of nonthreatening practice at addition and subtraction. <i>--Julie Ubben</i> The Dino Math Tracks game (winner of several prestigious awards, including an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Seal) is a race around the rainbow with a pack of pintsize, prehistoric pals.

The extruded 2 mm granules are sized to be eaten easily, decreasing waste. Tropican was developed and researched by the Hagen Avicultural Research Institute (HARI) and earns the HARI Seal of Approval. For over two decades, the HARI Flock has been fed exclusively Tropican Formulated diets! Tropican comes in a variety of extruded formulas and sizes to appeal to a variety of birds needs. The Tropican formulated diets includes: Ample fresh food and water should always be available to satisfy the demands of your pet bird. The food and water cups should be cleaned and re-filled daily with fresh water and fresh seeds to keep your pet bird healthy. Breeding parrots need extra protein to trigger reproductive hormones and ensure a healthy egg production. The female also requires more nutrients in her diet when rearing young because she is eating for more than just herself! While fledgling or juvenile parrot species do reach the outward appearance of an adult by the time they are weaned, their bodies on the inside are still developing and do benefit from a little extra &lsquo;punch&rsquo; of nutrients during this stage of their life. Achieve greater weaning success during this stressful time by spoon feeding warm, softened Tropican High Performance Weaning Diet when making the transition from syringe feeding to solid foods. If the babies are fed Tropican Hand Feeding Formula, they&rsquo;ll quickly recognize the same flavor and adapt to eating the softened Tropican on their own. It is suggested to feed Tropican High Performance Tropican Weaning Diet for the first six months after weaning for most parrot species, and up to nine months for large macaw species. Parrots that have been eating a primary diet of traditional parrot seed mix need a little boost to their amino acid profile, as well as other essential nutrients. They&rsquo;ve been getting all the fat they need, perhaps too much. But, they are not getting a complete amino acid profile; therefore, they haven&rsquo;t been getting the right protein. Tropican High Performance is made with ground sunflower meat and peanut kernel, a flavor those seed junkies will be sure to recognize and relish!\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9997488132115094}

All the wood used in manufacturing was either from surplus wood from furniture factories or farmed trees from re-growth forests. Just as it is in a modern metropolis, space is at a premium in the game of Cathedral. This game is a developer's dream! Cathedral challenges two players to place as many buildings as possible within the walls of a medieval city. There are two sets (light and dark) of hardwood buildings of various sizes. To begin the game, one player places the cathedral on the grid of the walled city. Then the two players vie for the remaining land. Their goal is to place their own buildings while thwarting their opponent's land-grabbing tendencies. If a player can completely surround one of his/her opponent's buildings, that building is removed from the board and the space gobbled up by a different building. The game ends up resembling a puzzle that must be thoughtfully pieced together. The winner is the player whose unplaced buildings would occupy the least amount of space in the city. Fans of chess should enjoy exercising their strategizing muscles on this one.

In modern times, running has become a popular sport, recreation and fitness activity. The run to Athens in 490 BC by an ancient Greek military courier named Pheidippides from a battlefield near the town of Marathon to report the Greek victory over the Persians is the famous endurance run upon which the first modern Olympics, held in Athens in 1896, based its longest distance run. It is legend that Pheidippides shouted, \"Victory!,\" as he entered Athens and then immediately died from exhaustion. Spiridon Louis, a postal worker, also from Greece, won the first modern marathon, finishing a full 7 minutes ahead of the other eight finishers (seven others of whom were also Greek). In addition to its importance as one of the most challenging and dramatic athletic events in each Olympic Games, the marathon run has become a popular event in many locations throughout the world every year, often resembling a \"fitness festival,\" celebrating human determination, stamina and dominance over the environment in which it is run. Finishing a marathon, in whatever time, is \"victory\" enough for most of the persons who enter the race. The Boston Marathon was first run on April 19, 1897. It is held every year on Patriots Day, commemorating the April 19th midnight ride of Paul Revere to warn his fellow American colonists in and around Boston that the British were invading from the sea at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The Boston Marathon is the oldest continuous marathon event outside of the Olympics. The New York City Marathon, begun in 1976 and held in November, has become the largest marathon, with over thirty thousand entries.

Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and \"face-ground\" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global's original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives, Global also makes a \"heavyweight\" line for cooks who prefer hefty cutlery--like this 6-1/4-inch boning knife, whose stiff blade is as thick as a traditional European knife's and ideal for meat and poultry and cutting through joints. Global also dispensed with bolsters on most of its knives, although this knife has one. Most Global knives have hollow handles, but the handle on this knife is solid. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9997175919220068}

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 7-inch hand-honed blade on this knife features a modest curve near the bolster and a straight cutting edge. The blade is long, slim, and flexible and is ideal for filleting fish or chicken; the thin edge allows the meat's fibers to be cleanly separated, making quick work of even the toughest tuna. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell </i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines. Four Star knives were designed and developed in close cooperation with renowned professional chefs. The result was a fully forged knife with a unique molded handle. The Four Star line contains knives for all tasks, and includes the following open stock knife types: parer, bread, peeling, sandwich, utility, carving, chefs, granton edge slicer, santoku, and others. Four Star knives are also available in a range of block sets and gift sets. <td> </tr> </table> <P> <B>A Higher Standard in Knife Construction</B><P> Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of exclusive-formula, high-carbon, no-stain steel under the all-new Sigmaforge standard.

As a practicing veterinarian in the 1960's Dr Ted Lafeber Sr. was treating pet birds and soon realized that most pet birds were suffering from malnutrition. Birds can not survive on millet, canary seed and sunflower seeds alone. In 1975, he created the very first pet bird pellet recipe. Initially, many people thought he was crazy, birds eat seeds, not pellets, but then they saw the results the birds eating pellets were healthier, happier and living longer. Nutritionally Balanced Good health and a long life begin with proper nutrition and Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet is formulated to provide exactly that. Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet is a high quality blend of natural ingredients like ground non-GMO corn and soybean meal. Both grains are literally grown outside Lafeber Company's front door. We also add whole egg, the world's most digestive form of protein. The different grains are mixed and essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids are added which are necessary for strong bones and brilliant feathers. Watch your feathered friend shine with the excellent nutrition found in Lafeber' s pelleted bird food. Balancing the Omega Fatty Acids increases immune function. Generally, increased immune function helps the body's ability to fight disease. Balanced Omega 3 & 6's also improves the quality of the skin. More than ever, each pelleted recipe provides excellent nutrition for your loved feathered companion. Creating the first Omega 3 & 6 balanced pet bird pellet is just one of the reasons Lafeber Company is considered the leader in avian nutrition. Our veterinarians and nutritionist determined the best combination of natural preservatives, specifically mixed tocopherols and citric acid, to protect the nutrients of Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet pellets.

Will you take power through force, coerce your way onto the throne with persuasive speeches, or rally the townsfolk to your side? With opportunities for strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, this game gives you a host of ways to spread your influence over Westeros. Based on the bestselling fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin (now a hit HBO series), A Game of Thrones: The Board Game draws players into a war-torn world of sun-scorched sands, lush forests, and chilling northlands. Each player takes control of one of six Great Houses of Westeros, then sets out on an epic campaign of combat and politics to secure total dominance. This board game includes clear, detailed rules to guide you through setup and gameplay. Play begins when each person receives an army of footmen, knights, siege engines and ship units as well as a set of order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique house cards, which represent important characters from <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">A Song of Ice and Fire</span> and are used as leaders in battles against rival houses. A Game of Thrones: The Board Game captures the most memorable elements of George R.R. Martin's popular series. The detailed board represents an accurate map of Westeros, and the tokens and cards convey many of its most significant locations and characters. Attractive marbled plastic figures shaped as footmen, knights, ships, and siege engines display your military might to the realm while contributing to the game's overall medieval aesthetic. Game play proceeds over the course of ten rounds, after which the player who has claimed the most areas containing castles or strongholds is declared the winner. If at any time throughout the game a player controls seven such areas, that player may immediately claim victory. Fragile alliances will form and break over the course of each game, as players promise support to neighboring Houses only to betray them for their own selfish ends. But beware; as the war unfolds, the barbaric Wildings (which are controlled automatically by the game) work to amass their forces in the far north. Players must occasionally set aside their differences to face a common foe--or face the consequences together. A Game of Thrones: The Board Game draws you into a vibrant gaming world, bringing your favorite characters to life. The board resembles paint on distressed parchment for an old-world look, while the token and card art exhibits intricate detailing fans of the novels will recognize and enjoy.

Overall Width - Side to Side: -2.2\". Overall Depth - Front to Back: -0.7\". Overall Product Weight: -0.2 lbs. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and \"face-ground\" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global's original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives, Global also makes a European-style \"heavyweight\" line for cooks who prefer hefty cutlery--like this 3-inch paring knife for cleaning and peeling vegetables and fruits. Global also dispensed with bolsters on most of its knives, including this one. Most Global knives have hollow handles, but the handle on this knife is solid. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a sharpening guide rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding.

Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt.

Based on the results of extensive computer simulations, this grind is ideally suited to working with thick stock and stacks of single- or double-sided laminates. The blade's teeth also feature 6-degree, negative hook angles, which helps prevent the blade from being too aggressive and further reduces the possibility of chipping. This blade is designed for optimal performance when cutting stacks of 3/4-inch laminates and melamine, and it's also an excellent performer in plywood and chipboard. This blade can also crosscut or rip wood, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This thick-stock saw blade's 48 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide \"laminate blend.\" Formulated to extend tooth life in the face of work with laminates, melamine, and solid surfaces, this blend is extra hard--due to the proportion of high-density tungsten carbide that goes into it--and it still offers the mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo. With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money. <b>Silver I.C.E. Coating Resists Corrosion, Heat, and Resin Buildup</b><br>This blade is finished with Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which resists corrosion for improved performance over time. This unique coating also resists heat buildup, protecting your saw and your work surface and preventing the blade from warping. It also helps prevent resin or \"pitch\" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup means longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry. Freud is one of the few manufacturers of woodworking tools in the world that produces its own MicroGrain Carbide with Titanium, called TiCo, a high-density combination of Titanium and Cobalt. By producing their own carbide, Freud has the unique ability to formulate each tool for each specific application, thereby maximizing the cutting life and performance of the tool.

Dimensions: -Dimensions: 13.2'''' H x 15'''' W x 56.5'''' D. To woodworkers who know the reputation of Jet products, the merit of this 12-inch variable-speed lathe should come as no surprise. Start with the guts of any tool, the motor. Prewired for 115 volts and fully encased in a metal housing for longer life, its 3/4-horses turn material at 500 to 3,000 rpm, depending on which of the six speeds you select. The cast-iron lathe bed, headstock, and tailstock provide superior vibration dampening and durability, while the heavy-gauge steel components and stand give rigid support. Pivoting 90 degrees for outboard turning of up to 16-1/2 inches on larger projects, the MT-2 headstock protects a Reeves drive pulley system with which we made quick and easy speed changes. Down on the other end, the hollow tailstock allows for longer hole bores and houses a live center, a luxury standard on all Jet lathes not found in much of the competition. You'll love the versatility that comes with 34-1/2 inches between working centers and a 12-inch swing capability over the bed (8-3/4 inches over the tool-rest base). All adjustments, whether extending the ram its full 2-1/4 inches or sliding the 12-inch tool rest, move fluidly and clamp down tight with little effort.

With Mariachi Imports sense of color, there is a rug or runner for every indoor and outdoor space you have. Mad Mats are made from 100% recycled plastic, are UV protected and fade-proof, and come with our one-year color guarantee. Because our rugs are handmade, pattern, color and size may vary slightly. Mad Mats' patterns are intricately woven. Multi-colored threads are woven in much the same fashion as real flat weave wool rugs. The result is a warmth and depth of color usually only available to the interior rug market. Most outdoor plastic mats on the market today are made from a combination of virgin polypropylene (PPL) and polystyrene. Mad Mats' plastic is completely different. First, our polypropylene is recycled from used soda bottles, milk bottles, packing, etc. We use only the highest grade of this recycled PPL. Then we combine it with state of the art conditioners and U.V. inhibitors to produce soft, resilient colorfast threads. Our soft tubular threads don't absorb dirt or stains of any kind. Leaves, debris, and food spills are easily rinsed away with a garden hose. They are truly carefree! This is a major advantage of Mad Mats. Most outdoor rugs are a dense weave of spun poly thread. They hold moisture for days which then gets tracked into the house. Grass, food, and dirt seep into the fiber where they remain until the rug is pulled up and washed, dried, and put back in place. YUCK! Mad Mats breathe. They don't trap water so they won't mildew and they won't rot wooden decks. Water goes right through them and evaporates right back out of them. Walking on Mad Mats the morning after a rainy night will leave your feet dry enough to walk right into the house. You put it down and that's it!

Two separate families, Jean Sabatier of Le Moutier (lower Thiers) and Phillipe Sabatier of Bellevue (upper Thiers), began using the name in their makers mark. Over the years, many makers began using Sabatier in their branding. In general, it implies a high-quality knife made in the Thiers region of France using a fully forged process. As intellectual property standards were established in France, manufacturers were required to include a second word or symbol along with SABATIER and many marks were registered. In 1979, when one of the trademarks was sold and the brand began to be used on inferior products, the various trademark holders formed an association to protect the brand name and reputation. Only knives manufactured in Thiers, France from well established manufacturers from the 19th century are considered genuine Sabatier knives. With their glowing copper handles, the eight 4-1/2-inch knives in this set cut steaks, chops, and roasts into bite-size pieces with style. These are heavy, substantial knives with high-carbon, stainless-steel blades. The blades' fine serrations tend to tear rather than slice precisely through steak fibers.

Birds flock from miles around to consume these flavorful minerals. Hardened minerals provide a variable surface that attracts the birds curiosity. Solves two problems associated with most mineral blocks: Problem: Many birds just ignore the block, preventing them from ingesting vital nutrients. Solution: Once the bird roosts on the perch, it naturally rubs its beak along the wood and minerals; birds find the taste irresistible! From then on, the bird will chew through the perch to gain access to the mineral center. Problem: Some birds aggressively attack a new block, demolishing it in a few minutes.

Adult Cat Feeding Instructions: Fill your cat's bowl with the recommended measured amount every morning and allow your cat to eat on a \"free choice\" basis throughout the day, rather than as a single feeding at mealtime. Food intake required to maintain an ideal body condition will vary, depending on age, activity and environment. Monitor your cat's weight and adjust food amount accordingly.

Proper diet, exercise and veterinary care are the best ways to keep your cat healthy. If your cat hasn't had a check-up in the past year, please make an appointment today. Making the Switch to Purina ONE: Although you'll be anxious to see the difference Purina ONE can make in your cat, please allow 7-10 days to ease the transition from your cat's current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Purina ONE until you're feeding Purina ONE exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets.

It's constructed of dark porcelain surface and steel core absorb energy to heat rapidly. There are no PFOA's or other chemicals to alter food's taste, color or healthfulness. Porcelain is fused to the steel at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit producing a non-porous, inert glass surface that is naturally non-stick. Porcelain can chip if dropped, however this does not reduce the effectiveness of the cookware. It creates a smooth, hard finish that wont burn and resists staining. Its also non -porous so it wont trap odors or food particles and provides a low coefficient of friction  meaning that it cleans up easily and, it is corrosion and chemically resistant so it will last a long time. When fired, the vessel is placed on pins so the bottom and sides are hardened during the firing process into one smooth laminated glass surface. You may notice slight pin indentations where the glass has flowed around the pin that supports the base during firing. The pin marks do not compromise the finish or performance of the vessel. Not recommended for glass cooktops. This is your grandmother's pot--and her grandmother's, too. There are good reasons this black porcelain-on-steel cookware, with its classic granitelike styling, proves popular generation after generation. It's inexpensive, lightweight but sturdy, won't rust or corrode, and cleans easily. And it lasts a lifetime and beyond. This big pot is perfect for simmering broths, soups, and sauces; for boiling lots of pasta when the whole family arrives; for steaming heaps of vegetables; and for canning. The pot stands 12 inches high and is 11-1/4 inches in diameter. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9978842965994069}

Made In China\" COL description VAL \"16PC. Stainless Steel 18/10 Cookware Set-Professional-Philippe Richard Use and Care Instructions are as follows: Before First Use: Wash pan in warm soapy water. 'Season' Pan with a small amount of cooking oil. Wipe off any excess oil. Oven Cooking: Non-Stick Cookware is oven safe to 350F. Do not use under the boiler as it may cause damage to the non-stick coating. Always use oven mittsor pot holders when removing pots or pans from the oven as the handles will also get hot. Glass lid is not recommended for oven use above 270F. Cooking Utensils: Tabletops Unlimited Inc. uses non-stick coating on the interiors of the cookware. Though this is a premium coating and is very durable, we do not recommend using metal utensils to mix, stir or release food from our pans. Wood, plastic or nylon tools are preferred. Do not use under the broiler as it may cause damage to the non-stick coating. Cleaning: Clean-up is as simple as using a sponge and warm soapy water, or cookware is also dishwasher safe. Do not use abrasive cleaning pads. Including a comprehensive cookware collection and an inclusive set of kitchen tools, this 16-piece ensemble from Philippe Richard establishes a strong foundation for any first time kitchen owner. Attractive and durable, the pans feature 18/10 stainless-steel construction with securely riveted handles and snuggly fitting, tempered glass lids. Thanks to an encapsulated aluminum disk in the base of each vessel, heat distributes quickly and evenly allowing for the prevention of unwanted hot spots. Generously sized loop handles and finger indentations along their straighter counterparts provide comfort during use. On the downside, the steel handle material retains heat and as a result requires the use of a cloth or potholder. While the glass lid construction affords the convenience of food monitoring, its disadvantage lies in the limited ability to withstand oven temperatures above 270 degrees F. The cookware set consists of an 8-inch omelet pan and 10-inch skillet for frying and sauting; a 2-quart saucepan and 3-quart casserole pan with lids for cooking pasta and steaming vegetables; and a generous 6-quart Dutch oven with lid for making hearty stews or cooking a cluster of full-cob corn. Each item in the utensil collection features durable nylon construction for safe use with nonstick pans and stain resistance. Conveniently stored in an included ceramic holder, the kitchen tools include: 11-3/4-inch ladle, 12-inch pasta server, 12-inch serving spoon, 12-inch slotted spoon, 12-1/2-inch spatula, 13-inch slotted spatula, and a 13-inch perforated skimmer.

These comfortable, molded handles are break-proof, sanitary, and colorfast. In addition, the super bolster and full rat-tail tang provides weight, insures safety, and adds balance.   Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of J.A. Henckels exclusive high-carbon, no-stain steel formula under the all-new SIGMAFORGE standard. As a result, Four Star knives have improved quality consistency, lasting sharpness, and perfect geometry. SIGMAFORGE one-piece construction also provides high precision and improved stability of the blade and steel structure, thus improving cutting-edge retention for lasting sharpness. In addition, Four Star knives use J.A. Henckels' FRIODUR ice hardening for corrosion resistance, a process that also contributes to cutting-edge retention. Manufactured in Germany. A 12-inch chef's knife is the largest made, suitable for professional chefs and serious cooks with good knife skills. Its curved, stainless-steel blade is perfect for rocking through chopping and mincing tasks; as a kitchen workhorse, the knife is also useful for cutting and slicing. Like other top-grade Henckels knives, Four Star blades are formed by a high-tech welding process that combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics. Traditionalists might insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are stronger than the steel. Knife handles don't have full tangs, but they're made of tough polypropylene. <i>--Fred Brack</i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines.

In this configuration, each flat-top tooth is followed by a trapezoidal tooth that's slightly higher. The trapezoidal tooth delivers a precut slot that's narrower than the final kerf, which helps prevent brittle materials--like chipboard--from chipping near the blade. Plus, the large gullets between these teeth ensure quicker cuts and easy chip removal. The blade's ideal crosscutting range includes materials that are 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thick, while the range when ripping includes materials that are 3/8 to 3/4-inch thick. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This heavy-duty saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide \"general purpose blend.\" Formulated to maximize density, hardness, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance, this blend is ideally matched to the varied demands that are placed on a multi-purpose saw blade. With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money. <b>Silver I.C.E. Coating Resists Corrosion, Heat, and Resin Buildup</b><br>This blade is finished with Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which resists corrosion for improved performance over time. This unique coating also resists heat buildup, protecting your saw and your work surface and preventing the blade from warping. It also helps prevent resin or \"pitch\" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup means longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry. Freud is one of the few manufacturers of woodworking tools in the world that produces its own MicroGrain Carbide with Titanium, called TiCo, a high-density combination of Titanium and Cobalt.

Ideal for large-volume production work, this blade features 80 teeth with a triple-chip grind. The blade's teeth also feature 10-degree, positive hook angles, which contribute to the blade's speed and extended tooth life. This blade is designed for optimal performance when cutting laminate or melamine that ranges from 1/4 to 1-5/8 inches in thickness. It's also an excellent performer when working with plywood and chipboard, and a solid performer when crosscutting wood. This blade can also rip wood, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This laminate saw blade's 80 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide \"laminate blend.\" Formulated to extend tooth life in the face of work with laminates, melamine, and solid surfaces, this blend is extra hard--due to the proportion of high-density tungsten carbide that goes into it--and it still offers the mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo. With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money. <b>Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat Buildup</b><br>Built to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp. As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or \"pitch\" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop.

Heavy duty steel Quik Lok blade clamp system enables user to change blades quickly and easily without the use of a hex wrench. 8 3-wire Quik Lok cord. Impact Resistant Carrying Case and two blades included This item will take 2-3 weeks to ship. Shipments cannot be expedited on this item. For years, Milwaukee's Sawzalls have been valued for their outstanding ability to cut through almost any material: wood, nail-embedded wood, steel, cast iron, aluminum, brass, drywall, composition materials, hard rubber, cement, brick, plaster, and fiberglass. The Super Sawzall features variable-speed control, with a speed control dial for faster cutting and better efficiency and control over a wide range of materials and applications. The blade is reversible, too, allowing you to cut upside down in tight spaces. For those of you who've grown up with Sawzalls, you'll appreciate the addition of the handy Quik-Lok blade clamp, which lets you change blades quickly without having to use a hex wrench; this feature is especially convenient when you're cutting hard materials, such as steel, a situation in which blades break frequently. There's also a handy quick lever adjustment for the shoe. We really like this tool's counterbalancing mechanism, which reduces some of the unavoidable vibration found in reciprocating saws. The difference you feel when operating this tool, compared to nonbalanced saws, is significant: the Super Sawzall is still extremely powerful, yet it has a smooth feel. As a result, of course, you can work longer with less fatigue than you can using other, unbalanced saws. Another significant feature is the clutch, which absorbs shock and impacts to the internal mechanics caused by sudden blade lockups (typically encountered during extreme use). While this is unquestionably a heavy tool, it does have a comfortable, ergonomically designed rubber grip that gives you a solid hold. And you can rely on the Super Sawzall to handle the most difficult jobs, either at home or at work. <I>--Tim Block</I>\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Johnson Level &amp; Tool 183 18-Inch Standard Aluminum Level - 3 vial\" COL feature VAL \"Aluminum I-beam frame 360 degree reading vials Quik-Change replaceable plastic covers V-grooved edge\" COL description VAL \"18&quot; Standard Aluminum Level with 3 acrylic Vials great for all basic leveling jobs convenient size will fit in many tool bags Inexpensive, lightweight extruded aluminum I-beam frame.

Routers don't get any bigger and tougher than this Hitachi workhorse. It has the solid construction, horsepower, and features we've come to expect in a top-of-the-line router. Its heft goes a long way toward eliminating vibration, working with the soft-start motor to cut out torque at startup. Despite its nearly 12 pounds, it actually handles as well as most 3-1/4-horsepower routers we've tried in freehand applications. It has a 1/2-inch collet and a wide sub-base opening, making it suitable for working with all but the very biggest panel bits. It features electronic variable speed, so the router makes clean cuts in a wide range of different materials. We found the controls to be within easy reach of the handles, and though this isn't the quietest router we've used, it comes pretty close. We like the unique eight-position handles that let the tool be adjusted to the worker rather than the other way around. While this is a topnotch plunge router, it's also an excellent choice for table mounting, and many people choose this model for exactly that reason.

Equipped with electronic speed control, the M12VC produces a no-load speed of 8,000-24,000 RPM. This means the router maintains constant RPM even as the load varies, so you'll get precise, controlled cuts in a wide range of materials. Despite its powerful motor, the M12VC operates quietly. In fact, this router has a class-leading noise level of just 79.5dB, which means you'll get a quiet workshop, reduced vibration, and improved control. <b>Quick and Easy Depth Adjustments</b><br>The M12VC utilizes a two-stage motor release clamp for quick and accurate depth adjustments. The release clamp makes it easy to change from a fixed base to a plunge base (not included). Depth adjustments are also made easy by the nickel-plated motor housing, which also helps to reduce scratches and stains on the tool body. The M12VC has a collet capacity of 1/2 inch (not included) and 1/4 inch (included). <b>Ergonomically Designed for Comfort and Control</b><br>Like all Hitachi tools, the M12VC is ergonomically designed to enhance comfort and control on the job. To start, this tool weighs only 7.3 pounds, making comfortable enough for freehand routing. Additionally, the handles are wrapped in Elastomer compound to reduce vibration and prevent slippage for ultimate control. For further ease of use, the fixed base offers a smooth work surface for gliding over the workpiece without scratching.

Consisting of 108 letter cards in standard suits (Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs), WordThief asks players to construct valid English words from their seven-card hands.  Players collect scoring chips for each word they create.  Words formed entirely from one suit are protected from theft, (wordlocked), but those comprised from two or more suits are vulnerable to the next Word Thief.  It's a challenging, stimulating word game the whole family can enjoy!  Comes with 108 letter cards in four different suits, 100 scoring chips in four colors, scorepad and game instructions.  For 2 - 4 Players, Ages 9 and Up. Stealing the words right out of an opponent's mouth--or, in this  case, hand--has never been so accepted as in this vocabulary-building  board game. Designed for two to four players, Wordthief involves a  deck of letter cards, each of which is assigned a point value based on  its frequency of occurrence in English words. The obvious way to  create words is to use the seven cards dealt to you. The more  interesting way to accumulate points requires that you \"steal\" an  opponent's word and build a new word with more letters from your hand.  The player who makes the most words of the greatest point value wins the  round. An engaging alternative to <a  href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000IWDB/${0}\">Scrabble</a>, this game  requires no playing board.

The base has a built-in stainless-steel V-shaped blade with a safety button that locks in any of the six included blades, ensuring that they can never accidentally move out of place. The food holder has an ergonomically designed handle that allows the full range of slicing motion and provides a stable grip.

Food stays secured with the food guide, which pushes food through the holder and grips it with its sharp teeth. The mandoline comes with six different blades that perform a variety of slicing functions. A 1/8-inch julienne insert is ideal for grating shoestring potatoes or carrots while a wider 1/4-inch julienne blade makes strips of zucchini or beets for steaming.

The 1/4-inch blade also serves as a safety insert to keep the blade from damage during storage. A storage caddy holds all blades and also acts as a drying rack after washing. The mandoline has non-skid feet to securely hold the base during slicing and an indent on the base so it can be used over a bowl.

It puts a professional-style edge on any kitchen or sporting knife (except serrated knives). Because magnetic guides hold a blade at the proper angles, no guesswork is involved. You simply grip your knife loosely and pull it lightly through the sharpener's slots without pressing down. Key to this knife sharpener's performance is the two different stages: the sharpening stage and the second honing stage, which polishes the blade to a razor edge. Those two stages create different bevels, putting a \"shoulder\" on an edge instead of sharpening with a single bevel. The shoulder strengthens the edge so it lasts longer. For each stage there is a pair of slots, and the slots use 100 percent diamond abrasives for hardness.

The internal elastomeric spring guides hold knife blades at just the right angle to the sharpening surfaces, making sharpening easy. The instructions are easy to follow, and maintenance is limited to removing the metal dust shavings from the clean-out tray once a year or so; no lubrication is necessary for the motor, bearings, or sharpening surfaces.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

Made from CROMOVA 18 stainless steel, this light knife was created for optimum performance. It was made from a single piece of steel, and has a convex edge for easier slicing. The strength comes from the ice hardening process that reaches a Rockwell degree of C-56-58. It has a wide blade with a thick edge to give you ultimate control. Using this knife feels good on the hands thanks to the hollowed handle and compact design, making it ergonomic for repetitive use. The iconic Global dimple design is on the traditional handle for a nonslip grip. 7\" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and \"face-ground\" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Although Global also makes a \"heavyweight\" line for cooks who like hefty knives, its original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. This knife, however, is relatively heavy. Thick at the back, the broad, 7-inch blade, designed for butchering fish and chopping hard vegetables, carries enough weight to chop through fish bones. For clean, low-friction cutting, the blade is tapered to an edge on only one side so it's even sharper than other Global knives. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"", "match": "0", "match_confidence": 0.9826076540451688}

Many woodworkers prefer the barrel grip on this model, however, arguing that it's easier to cut scrolls and curves when the saw is pushed forward (as opposed to down). Aside from the difference in grip, this saw is much like its top-handle counterpart: the balance is superb, the 5 amp motor packs plenty of power, the foot plate tilts left and right (up to 45 degrees), and the base retracts for flush cutting.

Ideal for working with materials that are 1-1/2 to 3-1/2-inches thick, it can be used in manual feeding situations or with power feeders, and it can handle both single- and gang-rip operations. It has a 1-inch arbor and produces a 0.177 kerf. In addition to offering faster cuts through thick materials, its large-tooth design allows the blade to be safely sharpened more times, prolonging the life of the blade and saving you money. Also, the large gullets between the teeth ensure easy chip removal. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features an anti-vibration design that reduces chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This thick-stock, rip saw blade's 24 teeth are finished with tips made from an application-specific TiCo high-density carbide that offers improved hardness, corrosion resistance, and heat resistance. Ideal for the demands of ripping large quantities of thick, hard wood, this carbide blend includes extra cobalt for increased impact resistance. In addition, it delivers increased sharpness and edge retention, which means the blade will hold up longer--saving you money. <b>Silver I.C.E. Coating Resists Corrosion, Heat, and Resin Buildup</b><br>This blade is finished with Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which resists corrosion for improved performance over time. This unique coating also resists heat buildup, protecting your saw and your work surface, and preventing the blade from warping. It also helps prevent resin or \"pitch\" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup means longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited, lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry. Freud is one of the few manufacturers of woodworking tools in the world that produces its own MicroGrain Carbide with Titanium, called TiCo, a high-density combination of Titanium and Cobalt.

A tall, old-fashioned-looking blender, it will crush ice and blend frozen fruit beautifully in a few seconds. This blender feels sturdy: the lid, with a cap that doubles as a 1-ounce measurer, fits securely, and the pitcher, made of thick, ridged glass, won't wobble. Many chefs prefer a blender rather than a food processor for soups and creamy sauces--the blades of a good blender whirl more quickly than those of a food processor and will refine a thin liquid such as cream of tomato soup to an incomparably silky texture. This blender is definitely up to that task. The fixed, self-cleaning stainless-steel blades on the base of the pitcher mean the lid is the only separate part to wash.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Waring WPB05 Professional Kitchen Blender, Chrome\" COL feature VAL \"40-ounce glass jar holds 5 cups of mixed drinks, soup, or sauce Powerful 350-watt motor crushes ice fast High and low speeds cover mixing, chopping, and pureeing Dishwasher-safe glass jar and lid for easy cleaning Measures 16-1/2 by 8 by 7 inches; 1-year warranty, 5-year motor warranty\" COL description VAL \"WPB05 Color: Chrome Features: -Simple 2-speed operation. -Commercially rated heavy-duty motor with 500 peak input watts. -Manufacturer provides 5 years limited motor warranty.

This one, a hardworking blender with a durable glass pitcher and a sturdy metal base, can quickly pulverize ice or pure a vichyssoise to creamy smoothness. The stainless-steel blade is removable on this model, and the plastic ring that attaches the blade to the pitcher feels a little light for such a heavy blender.

About Stanley FatMax Tape Systems and BladeArmor Coating The FatMax family of products has established itself as one of Stanley's most extensive and innovative product families in the company's 161-year history. The FatMax line of hand tools features core tools essential for the pro or expert enthusiast who desire high quality, durable tools. BladeArmor coating is a patented industrial thermoplastic coating, the very same material that has been used to strengthen and protect aircraft parts, such as the rotor blades on the Sikorsky Black Hawk Helicopter. Simply put, it helps aircraft survive war zones, and it also helps tape blades survive construction zones. Applying BladeArmor coating to tape blades reduces both tape breakage and tape returns, enabling it to conquer the toughest testing ground of all -- the job site! The Stanley Works, originally a bolt and door hardware manufacturing company located in New Britain, Connecticut; was founded in 1843 by Frederick T. Stanley. A few years later, in 1857, Fredericks cousin, Henry Stanley, founded The Stanley Rule and Level Company. In 1920, The Rule and Level Company merged with The Stanley Works and would go on to become its famous Hand Tools Division. Over the years, The Stanley Works has produced some of the most innovative and useful tools ever made. Among these tools are the Bailey Plane, the Surform shaper, the PowerLock tape rule and most recently the FatMax line of products. Today, more than ever, Stanley continues to be an industry leader in tool innovation. In 2001, Stanley introduced more than 100 new products, bringing to 400 the number of new products introduced in the past four years. As a direct result of Stanleys commitment to excellence, Stanley was awarded the Prestigious Golden Hammer Award, presented for New Product Innovation in both 2000 and 2001.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9994946954202548}

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 8-inch fine-edged blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a sharp point. Part of the popular Four Star series, the hand-honed blade is slim and narrow to facilitate even, precise meat cutting and flexible enough to allow thin slicing. It is made with Henckels' Sintermetal Component Technology (SCT), which allows three different grades of steel to be combined to form a single piece, fusing together the blade, bolster, and tang. What does this mean in layman's terms? It means a strong, high-quality knife that will last a lifetime. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell </i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines. Four Star knives were designed and developed in close cooperation with renowned professional chefs. The result was a fully forged knife with a unique molded handle. The Four Star line contains knives for all tasks, and includes the following open stock knife types: parer, bread, peeling, sandwich, utility, carving, chefs, granton edge slicer, santoku, and others. Four Star knives are also available in a range of block sets and gift sets. <td> </tr> </table> <P> <B>A Higher Standard in Knife Construction</B><P> Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of exclusive-formula, high-carbon, no-stain steel under the all-new Sigmaforge standard. As a result, Four Star knives have improved quality consistency, lasting sharpness, and perfect geometry. Sigmaforge one-piece construction also provides high precision and improved stability of the blade and steel structure, thus improving cutting-edge retention for lasting sharpness. In addition, Four Star knives use J.A. Henckels Friodur ice hardening for corrosion resistance, a process that also contributes to cutting-edge retention. <P> <center> <img src=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-twinselect-forging.jpg align=\"center\"></center> <p clear=left> <B>It's All in The Grip:</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar-handle.jpg </td> <td> The Four Star series features high impact polypropylene handles that are permanently bonded to the knife blades without any gaps.

Just pick a size, pick a color, and get ready to inspire neighborhood-wide envy. At Weber they believe that grilling should be as fun as it is flavorful. Self-proclaimed perfectionists, they've dedicated themselves to that standard since 1952 when they made their first charcoal kettle. That's because they know that when you've got friends and family hovering around the grill, hungry for that unmistakable charcoal flavor, the last thing you want to contend with is shoddy construction or burnt food. So Weber did their homework, designing products that won't let you down. The result? Grills that don't require an engineering degree to assemble, last for many long years of dependable service and--most importantly--deliver exceptionally delicious grilled results every time. Weber kettles combine traditional design with innovation in production. Made of steel and coated with porcelain enamel, the bowl and lid are formed exactly right to allow heat to circulate around the inside of the grill for even cooking. The porcelain enamel is baked on at approximately 1500 degrees F ensuring that your grill will not only withstand the heat of many cookings, but also resist rust- and burn-through. In addition, the smooth, hard-wearing surface makes cleanup easy. Closed-lid cooking is a signature of Weber products. The damper system created by Weber allows for control of the heat inside the unit without lifting the lid. Simply adjusting the damper provides temperatures low enough to smoke food for hours or high enough the sear steaks. Made of rust-resistant aluminum and placed just so in the lid, the damper is as durable as it is functional Every Weber charcoal cooking grate provides ample cooking area for any meal. Made of heavy-duty plated steel, these cooking grates are durable and easy to clean, and they can hold enough heat to give you beautiful sear marks. The hinged grates have an area on either side that lifts to allow access to the fuel without lifting the whole grate or removing food from the grill. Adding or adjusting charcoal is hassle free and easy. The Weber charcoal grate has what it takes to withstand the heat of any charcoal fire. Made of heavy-duty plated steel, these durable grates won't warp or burn through. Additionally, they give you enough space for a direct set-up or an indirect set-up. Weber charcoal grates give you the flexibility to cook the way you want. The One-Touch cleaning system makes cleanup hassle free. As you rotate the handle, the three blades in the bowl move ash through the vents in the bowl and down into the ash catcher. The aluminum ash catcher lifts out for easy ash disposal and cleaning. The fully enclosed ash catcher keeps ashes from blowing around and is easily detached for quick and clean ash removal. This not only makes cleaning out the bowl a breeze but also helps keep you cooking longer by preventing the build-up of ashes that blocks vents and suffocates the fire. In addition to providing a quick and easy way to clean the bowl, the One-Touch cleaning system also acts as a second damper. The same vents that allow ash to fall easily out of the bowl help bring oxygen up to the fire. Closing the One-Touch cleaning system and the top damper allow you to choke out the fire easily. As part of the One-Touch series, the 22.5-inch Gold kettle grill provides a plated-steel hinged cooking grate that measures 22-1/2 inches in diameter for 363 square inches of total cooking space. The sleek unit also features a heavy-gauge porcelain-enameled bowl and lid with glass-reinforced nylon handles, rust-resistant vents, durable all-weather wheels, and a removable, aluminum, high-capacity ash catcher. Best of all, the grill's aluminized-steel One-Touch cleaning system allows you to empty the ash in seconds without getting your hands dirty. Overall, the grill measures 22-1/2 inches long by 27 inches wide by 38-1/2 inches high and carries a 10-year limited warranty. <b>Note:</b> Images shown above are of the Weber One-Touch Charcoal Kettle series in Black; features illustrated vary by model. When George Stephen created the first Weber grill, he wanted to be able to bring his family together for a good meal. He insisted on a product that would exceed customers' expectations. In the years since then, the Weber name has become synonymous with backyard barbecues and the family, friends, and good times that go with them. At Weber, they continue that tradition of excellence in everything they do from the development of new grills and accessories to the services they provide to customer and dealers. From the very beginning, Weber revolutionized backyard grilling. Since then, they have continued to develop products that enhance the grilling experience. From the original kettle with heat controlling dampers to electronic temperature controls and Flavorizer bars, Weber continues to be at the forefront of modern grilling, making the backyard a part of your kitchen. Weber grills have been and will continue to be the true definition of performance in backyard grilling. Whether you're cooking a basic burger or an extensive meal, Weber grills are designed and engineered to give you the best performance every time. Service is of the utmost importance at Weber. Their Customer and Dealer Service associates work every day to ensure that their customers and dealers have the support they need.\"", "match": "0", "match_confidence": 0.9963500129687902}

Folkmanis has grown to become the premier manufacturer of plush puppets worldwide, offering over 200 of the most heartwarming and realistically designed creatures--both exotic and familiar--on the market today. Puppets nurture the imagination, inspire creativity, develop interactive play, and expand language. This reviewer has found them to be excellent tools for teaching foreign languages--children will comfortably experiment when manipulating a puppet, but not when simply talking to a friend. As children mature, they are able to use puppets in a more sophisticated manner that will help them last a good long time. Snowy Owl is well made and true to form with her white and gray spotted fur. The texture of her leather beak and talons gives her an air of authenticity, and her large glass eyes ringed with thick white fur won't miss a rodent. A plastic stick inside Snowy Owl's body lets you rotate her head 360 degrees. With a wingspan of 22 inches, she will play a prominent role on the puppet stage. <I>--Sandy Hirsch</I>\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9992678187383394}

For the discerning customer, the Easy to Set timer combines function, style and value. Timex It takes a licking and keeps on ticking. <div class=\"aplus\"> Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico. The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the \"Switzerland of America.\" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time. During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through \"torture tests,\" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan \"It takes a licking and keeps on ticking.\" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches. The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality. One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity. Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Milwaukee 48-00-5026 The Ax 9-Inch 5 TPI Reciprocating Saw Blades, 5-Pack\" COL feature VAL \"N/A Made in USA or Imported Unique heat-treating process hardens the blade for incredible durability Blades are .062 inches thick and 9 inches in length 1/2-inch tang fits all Sawzalls Reciprocating saw blades ideal for heavy demolition work Unique heat-treating process hardens the blade for incredible durability Blades are .062 inches thick and 9 inches in length 1/2-inch tang fits all Sawzalls 5-pack; 5-year limited manufacturer's warranty\" COL description VAL \"The Milwaukee 48-00-5026 The Ax 9-Inch Reciprocating Saw Blades are designed for the toughest cutting applications in wood and nail-embedded wood.

This means it provides you with smoother cuts, and it can handle fast feed rates. It's ideal for crosscutting hard- or softwoods that are 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thick, and it also provides good results when cutting plywood and chipboard or when ripping wood. The blade can also handle laminate, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.090 kerf. Plus, because this thin-kerf blade removes less material than standard carbide blades, it wastes less material and requires less horsepower to produce smooth, clean results. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This crosscutting saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide \"crosscut blend.\" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo. With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money. <b>Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat Buildup</b><br>Built to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp. As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or \"pitch\" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

Made of heavy-duty cast iron, the cookware's colorful, long-lasting exterior enamel resists chipping and cracking, while its durable, nonreactive sand-colored interior enamel offers a smooth surface for cooking and an optimal palette for food presentation. As cast iron is unexcelled for even heat distribution and superior heat retention, and enamel is impervious to acids and odors, the oven browns and cooks food uniformly and gently without hot spots and can be used for marinating, cooking on the stovetop, or finishing in the oven. Two loop cast-iron side handles help ensure a steady grip during transport--even when wearing bulky oven mitts, and the unit's secure-fitting lid locks in heat and moisture while cooking. The lid also comes fitted with a black phenolic knob that's oven-safe up to 350 degrees F. Beautiful enough for the table yet durable enough to outlive its lifetime limited warranty, the French oven can be safely used on any stovetop, including induction, and should be hand washed for best results. Beautiful enough to bring to the table, yet durable enough to  outlive its 101-year warranty against defects, this heavy casserole is  perfect for preparing and ceremoniously serving dishes such as  choucroute garni and braised lamb shanks. The oval shape handles big  cuts of meat and big birds. Use it in the oven or on the stovetop for  soups and chili. Made of cast-iron, which is unexcelled for its heat  distribution and retention, this French oven cooks foods evenly and  gently without hot spots at low temperatures and is suitable for all  heat sources. This pan holds 5 quarts and its exterior and interior  are clad in two coats of Le Creuset's famous enamel. The plastic  knob on its heavy, tight-fitting lid is ovenproof to 450 degrees F.  Loop handles facilitate carrying, and the casserole is dishwasher-safe.  Like all Le Creuset cast-iron products, it is hand-cast in a  one-of-a-kind sand mold and hand-finished at the Le Creuset factory in  France. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Wusthof Classic 6.3-Inch Hollow Edge Euro-Utility Knife (16cm)\" COL feature VAL \"Narrow 6.3-inch blade for lunch meats, cheese, carving, slicing Alternating hollows on blade's sides prevent food from clinging Blade, bolster, tang forged from single piece of high-carbon stainless steel Tough polypropylene handle with full tang and traditional three rivets Made in Germany\" COL description VAL \"The Wusthof Classic 6 inch hollow edge utility knife is a must have for cutting sandwiches, sausage, fruits, vegetables, and other kitchen utility tasks. Wusthof Classic knives are forged from a single piece of high carbon no-stain steel, a specially alloyed steel. Painstakingly manufactured, these knives are pure fun to work with and will turn even the preparation of a simple dish into a culinary pleasure. Made in Solingen, Germany. Tough polypropylene handles with full, visible tangs and the traditional three rivets distinguish Classic knives from Wsthof's other cutlery lines. Otherwise Classic knives are identical to other Wsthof knives, embodying all the virtues that earn the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a Wsthof knife-- blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, Wsthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. With its narrow blade, this 6-inch utility knife neatly slices lunch meat, cheese, vegetables, and large fruits as well as carves a roast, ham, or turkey into serving portions. Alternating hollows on each side of the blade create air pockets, allowing slices to fall away cleanly and permitting thinner slicing. Like all fine knives, it should be hand washed with the care a lifetime investment deserves. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"", "match": "0", "match_confidence": 0.8877896276377429}

It will be the most flavorful and moist chicken you've ever had! Made of quality stainless steel, this roaster begins with a vertical roasting stand that attaches to a large, round drip tray (the stand collapses for easy storage). In the center of the drip tray sits a round dish with cone shaped top. Fill the round dish with herbs, spices, cider, juices or beer; as your chicken rests on the stand, the aromas and flavors from the liquids and herbs pass through the perforations on the cone shaped top, filling the cavity of the bird and adding moisture to the meat as it roasts. Instructions on using the vertical roaster are included. If your last experiment with a vertical roaster led to the bird tipping on its tripod base and landing in the grease pouring out of its cavity, here's a chance to get it right. This Norpro model is versatile enough to serve as a horizontal 13-by-8-1/2-inch rack for roasts. And it easily but sturdily converts to vertical roasting by anchoring up to four hooked pieces to the slats of the flat rack, enabling two birds to roast on this roost, cooking evenly inside and out, with no danger of capon cartwheel. Flipping the bird, so to speak, is a thing of the past--there's no need to pull the rack out of the oven halfway through cooking--and you may as well roast two while you have the heat cranked up (put one in the freezer for next week).

Granite Ware Roasting Pans by Columbian Home Products have been a part of American meals for over 100 years. From everyday meals to holiday specialties, our roasters make your life easier with faster cooking times, even heating and simple clean up. The naturally non-stick surface is highly durable even allowing you to use your metal utensils during cooking. And what gets you back to your family or guests faster than putting these American-made pieces in the dishwasher? Who doesnt remember growing up, waiting for the juicy Thanksgiving turkey to emerge from the oven in that dark, speckled oval roaster? Now you can own your very own. Or add to your collection. Bringing comfort foodjust the way mom used to make itto your own table. Ideally suited for a 12-pound bird or a 15-pound roast, this oval roaster boasts even heating and faster cooking times because of its unique construction. Our roasters have a strong carbon steel body perfect for absorbing and distributing heat evenly and quickly. They are energy efficient; the dark surface absorbs the ovens energy, lowering cooking times. Porcelain is fused to the steel at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit producing a non-porous, inert glass surface that is naturally non-stick. Porcelain can chip if dropped, however this does not reduce the effectiveness of the cookware. They are safe for metal utensils, easy to clean, and dishwasher safe! Won't Discolor or Alter Taste of Food:</br> They are great for flavor! Since the glass surface is inert and will not absorb foods, the taste is not altered like it can be with other surfaces. There are no PTFEs, PFOAs or any other chemicals to change the taste, color or nutritional value of the food. Roasters designed to accommodate weight of ingredients:</br> There is a Granite Ware roaster perfectly suited for any size meal, oven or food preparation method. Whether grilling, broiling, baking or roasting, we have a size and configuration to handle the task. Our roasters are equally at home in oven or on the grill. Cover can be used as a separate open roaster:</br> Lid works as a roaster too! It cooks faster and more evenly than other roasters, and is a better value than stainless steel roasters. The handles are built to hold the weight of the bird much better than a flimsy, disposable, aluminum foil tray.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9991152292953747}

Your foot flows through the motion just as it does when walking on sand -- your heel contacts first, then rolls up to the toes for push off. This eliminates the \"tingling foot\" sensation found on other ellipticals, and initiates core activation. The gel cushioning provides additional traction and shock absorption. Multiply workout options with power incline and premium handlebars: With the touch of a console button, use any of the 20 levels of power incline to take your workout to the next level or to vary the muscle groups you're working. Our premium, multi-grip handles help you find the position that's just right for your body. Quality you can feel: Long, 20-inch stride length is smooth and fluid. Enjoy a low-impact workout while diversifying your exercise routine with the Livestrong LS13.0E elliptical trainer. The LS13.0E reduces stress on your legs by mimicking the natural path of your ankle, knee, and hip joints. Because your feet remain on the pedals at all times, there is zero impact, making the trainer a great option for people with sensitive joints, folks who are rehabbing after knee injuries, or even newcomers starting a fitness program for the first time. An elliptical also offers a full-body workout that includes resistance for the quadriceps, chest, back, hamstrings, glutes, triceps, and biceps. As a result, you'll tone your muscles while keeping your metabolic heart rate up, helping you burn calories long after your workout is finished. <table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"10\" width=\"225\"> <tbody><tr><td><img align=\"top\" border=\"0\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/detail-pages/B0065MU6KQ-1.jpg\" width=\"225\" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The console includes built-in speakers, an LCD display, and 2 LED feedback windows.</strong></em></small></td></tr></tbody></table> <b>Quality You Can Feel</b><br> It takes a heavy flywheel to produce a smooth performance. The LS13.0E more than qualifies, with a 30-pound flywheel that produces a smooth, fluid motion designed to withstand years of use. The trainer also offers a long 20-inch stride length and unique MaxTone pedals. Paired with a flat ellipse shape, the stride length encourages a natural walking and running motion for users of all heights. The MaxTone pedals, meanwhile, incorporate the science of balance training to keep your feet aligned. Your foot will flow through the motion just as it does when walking on sand--your heel contacts first, then rolls up to the toes for push off. This eliminates the \"tingling foot\" sensation found on other ellipticals and initiates core activation. Even the frame itself is designed to create a natural feel. Derived from extensive biomechanics research, the SixStar-certified frame focuses on all areas that impact the feel and comfort of an elliptical, including body positioning, handlebar spacing, elliptical footpath, pedal placement, elliptical access, and the trainer's drive mechanism. <b>Train Like a Pro</b><br> The LS13.0E includes 12 different workout programs to keep you fit, including Manual, Weight Loss, Muscle Toner, Strength Builder, Constant Watts, Mellow Johnny's Trail, Lance's Climb, Lance's Descent, Max Cardio, the Tour, Custom, and downloadable Livestrong.com programs.

In fact, the toaster can output up to 130 slices per hour, should the entire neighborhood ever depend on you for breakfast or tea. The key to Dualit's exceptionally even browning is the toaster's system of patented ProHeat elements, a series of flat bars behind a smooth, transparent coating.

A rocker switch selects 2- or 4-slice toasting, and a 4-minute timer knob lets you fine-tune browning time.

The exact variety varies with the season.\" COL description VAL \"Lithops, (commonly called \"flowering stones\" or \"living stones\") are true mimicry plants: their shape, size and color causes them to resemble small stones in their natural surroundings. The plants blend in among the stones as a means of protection. Grazing animals which would otherwise eat them during periods of drought to obtain moisture usually overlook them. Even experts in the field sometimes have difficulty locating plants for study because of this unusual deceptive camouflage. In the wild, Lithops inhabit vast dry regions of southern Africa. Several areas in which these plants grow receive less than 2 inches of rainfall per month throughout the entire year. In an extreme situation of low rainfall, at least one species of Lithops depends on mist or fog to provide its main source of moisture . Lithops could not survive in many areas that they are found were it not for their capacity to store water. In fact, almost the entire plant is devoted to this function. The \"body\" of the plant is divided into two succulent leaves fused together in the shape of an inverted cone. The fissure or slit at the top of the plant is the division of the two leaves. There is no stem as such, but rather the taproot joins abruptly at the base of the leaves. The structure of the plant reveals to the imagination the harsh environment in which Lithops live: the scarcity of water demands that young plants limited to only two leaves and a root system, as more extravagant growth would only serve to waste water. The leaves are thick to store enough water for the plants to survive for months without rain. The plants are small and keep a low profile to minimize the effect of the intense heat and light of their climate. Lithops do well if they receive about 4 or 5 hours of direct (or only slightly filtered) sunlight during the early part of the day, and partial shade during the afternoon. The exact variety you will receive varies with the season.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9989245975937657}
