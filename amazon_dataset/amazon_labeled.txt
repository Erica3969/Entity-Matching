This 3-Chip DILA design features a true 1920x1080 pixel structure that delivers resolution that rivals reality. Packed with supporting features for the most demanding digital customer like 5th Generation Digital Image Scaling Technology (D.I.S.T. 1080p) with GENESSA Picture Processing where all signals are upconverted and displayed at 1080p, a NEW Advanced Optical Iris, 5-Point Color Management, Dynamic Gamma Correction Circuitry, 2 1080p capable HDMI/HDCP Digital Inputs, Dual IEEE1394 Connectivity, 2 HD Component Inputs and features geared to make your Standard Definition sources perform better, like Mosquito Noise Suppression, MPEG Noise Reduction Circuity, a 3D Y/C Comb Filter with Cross Color Elimination and Digital Noise Suppression. With all of these features built in it is no wonder that JVC delivers the most technologically advanced and superior 1080p micro-display televisions available today. <b>The HD-ILA Advantage</b><br /> <b>True 1080p Over 2 Million Pixels Per Chip:</b> 3 chips are better than one. With HD-ILA and a 3 chip design consumers are getting the highest resolution available. Each DILA chip has 1920x1080 resolution or true 1080p, that equates to over 2 million pixels per chip or over 6 million pixels in each set. <b>Advanced Super Cinema Mode:</b> By using an iris, it is possible to regulate the amount of light from the projection lamp which goes into the light engine of the HD-ILA. For 06, the 1080P HD-ILA displays have an improved Advanced Super Cinema Mode which links the iris to JVCs exclusive Genessa single-chip picture computer. The Genessa processor analyzes the picture and adjusts the iris for the best picture. This creates many benefits:  Our newest GENESSA Chip detects and seamlessly up-scales all SD sources (480i and 480p) and all HD sources (720p or 1080i) and displays at 720p or 1080p. This customized upscaling insures that no matter what the original video source, the images will look as sharp, bright and smooth as intended. D.I.S.T. combines all of our core image preprocessing, noise reducing and color management technologies into one communication unit within the GENESSA chip. GENESSA is the industries first CPU dedicated to such image processing and its accelerated 32bit "turbo" powered picture processing provides for both super fast sampling and more efficient communication between the technologies that comprise the D.I.S.T. engine. Because all of our core technologies are able to work together and faster, JVC TVs yield incredibly fast calculations that translate to a smoother picture and a better resolution image.  <b>D6500K Theater Pro:</b> When the video editors convert films to DVD, or other video sources, the color temperature standard they use for their equipment is D6500K which is the equivalent or average color temperature of natural daylight. In transition to DVD, this color temperature can be lost but with our exclusive D6500K calibrating circuit, a press of the button can bring the original warm look and feel back to any video source. <b>Multi Screen Features:</b> Every HD-ILA television is widescreen which is perfect for viewing movies in their original format, but it also allows for some other convenient multi screen features as well. Twin mode lets you view two programs in same size windows side by side on the screen. Index lets you search what is on by scanning the programs consecutively in 12 separate windows. Once you see the program that you want to watch, press the SELECT button on your remote control to go to that channel.  In addition, HDMI is the perfect all-digital connection for D-VHS high definition VCRs as well as upconverting DVD players and recorders with an HDMI output. A JVC 1080P HD-ILA is a perfect solution for any source. <b>Standard Inputs:</b> No matter which model you choose,every HD-ILA model is substantially equipped with the inputs and outputs you need to connect your current components as well as any you may need in the future. Standard on every 1080P FN&amp;FH Series HD-ILA model are the following connections: <b>What's in the Box:</b> Projection TV, remote control, 2 RF cables, two way splitter, batteries, and instruction manual."	0

With Dolby Digital and DTS digital-audio outputs, as well as composite, S-Video, and ColorStream component video outputs, we found the SD-2109 well-equipped to power any burgeoning home-theater system. While more flexible DVD machines offer features such as analog decoding from Dolby Digital sources, karaoke-microphone inputs, and headphone jacks, the SD-2109 is by no means bereft of features. Besides traditional DVD features such as camera-angle selection, subtitling, and language preference, the Toshiba SD-2109 also offers three levels of zoom and reverse, and forward-play speeds from 1/8x to 30x. The Toshiba SD-2109 also does a great job locating specific sections on a disk through title and chapter skip as well as a convenient "time search" feature. A nice touch available on this and other Toshiba DVD players is Video Black Level expander circuitry. With this function you can expand the picture's overall contrast range to derive richer, deeper blacks and finer tonal gradation, both of which we found enhanced low-light viewing.

And unlike GPS devices designed for passenger cars, this truck navigation unit has a speaker that is twice as powerful as typical car speakers, amplifying the sound above cab noise so spoken directions come through loud and clear. <b>35-Percent More Truck-Route Information</b><br> Even before your truck has started, you can determine the best route to take by entering your truck's length, width, weight, height, and HazMat information. The IntelliRoute TND 700 has 35-percent more truck routing information than other GPS units. Enter as many as 10 stops and use the device's preferences tools to pass up tolls and construction without missing weigh stations, rest areas, or repair services. Connect the included USB cable to a Windows-compatible computer with internet connection for free updates including road construction. The IntelliRoute TND 700 provides turn-by-turn directions with spoken street names. The patented Smart-Time feature calculates the local time as well as the time at your destination--handy when traveling across multiple time zones. Included in the IntelliRoute TND 700 is searchable truck-stop information from The Trucker's Friend National Truck Stop Directory. You can find the nearest truck stop or search more than 70 amenities like showers, restaurants, Wi-Fi, and more! <b>Customized Trucker Business Tools</b><br> Loaded with all of the innovative tools featured in the IntelliRoute TND 500, the IntelliRoute TND 700 introduces more tools vital for truckers. A new calendar feature helps you keep track of important appointments and dates. Also, you can keep all of your reminders and notes together in the same place with the handy notepad feature. Drivers can reduce time-consuming manual calculations with the IntelliRoute TND 700. Drivers can track miles driven in every U.S. state or Canadian province for organized bookkeeping and fuel-tax reporting. User-set timers and logs keep track of driving time and time on duty. The IntelliRoute TND 700 was designed to partner with America's #1 trucker's atlas. Drivers can cross-reference to the page and grid of the Rand McNally Motor Carriers' Road Atlas. The Quick Planner tool helps determine the profitability of routes. A commercial-grade address book organizes thousands of entries, and allows you to group them the way that works best for you. With so many helpful tools, off-duty truckers may find themselves switching the IntelliRoute TND 700 to car mode and bringing it along for family trips. The IntelliRoute TND 700 is backed by a one-year parts-and-labor warranty. <b>What's in the Box</b><br> IntelliRoute TND 700, windshield mount, truck charger with extended length cable, 120/240V home

Boasting solid 1.25% silver-plated Long-Grain Copper (LGC) conductors, Cinnamon delivers low jitter, low distortion audio as well as superb picture quality. Cinnamon's signal conductors are controlled for digital audio direction. The bi-directional Ethernet communication and audio return channel is enabled.  AudioQuest has a well-earned reputation as a manufacturer of exceptional analog video cables. However, the advent of HDMI in 2004 presented a new set of design challenges that needed to be solved. In order for AudioQuest to maximize audio and video cable performance over HDMI, new materials and higher levels of manufacturing precision were employed to handle the high-speed, wide-bandwidth signals of HDMI.  While the basic blueprint for HDMI cable construction was established by the HDMI steering committee (HDMI, LLC), AQ examined areas that could be optimized within the established framework.  Several of the analog audio and video design elements that have proven so important over the years turned out to be meaningful to HDMI signal design. Solid core conductor technology, conductor metallurgy, insulation material and overall precision of manufacture have all been carefully optimized to create a superior line of HDMI cables.  With the Indulgence Series of HDMI cable, AudioQuest is proud to introduce the next evolution of HDMI cable performance. Why the word "indulgence"? When we set aside the time for audio/video entertainment in the home we are, after all, allowing ourselves a bit of well-earned personal indulgence. We allow ourselves time for emotional transportation via video and sound."	0

The camera also features an MPEG movie mode, audio annotation for your images, and a manual focus ring. The built-in flash features red-eye reduction and night-synch modes. Built-in zoom, trim, and resize functions encourage manipulation of the images while they are still in the camera. For maximum image resolution, the camera also includes an interpolated 1.6-megapixel image setting. Users compose images by viewing the 2.5-inch color LCD monitor on the back of the camera. This monitor also reveals the remaining shooting time in minutes, a well as having indicators for flash, focus, and other functions. Like most of the other cameras in the Mavica line, the MVC-FD90 uses floppy disks to store photos. At maximum image quality, five images fit on one floppy. At the other end of the spectrum is the e-mail setting, which captures 80 images at 320 x 240 resolution on a single disk. To address concerns about the limited number of photos one can store on a low-capacity floppy disk, Sony has devised a high-capacity solution: the camera will accept the MSAC-FD2M floppy adapter, a device that looks like a floppy disk. Sony's Memory Stick (available in capacities up to 64 MB) slides into the adapter, and the adapter slides into the camera's floppy drive, essentially giving you a 64 MB floppy disk. The package includes a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, a battery charger, a shoulder belt, AV cable, and ArcSoft PhotoStudio software for Windows."

The results give you dramatic improvements in sonic performance and picture resolution. Your music and sound will seem to emerge from a "blacker" background, rather than a "gray area." Midrange textures become more liquid and balanced. A sweeter and brighter treble sweeps the high end without harshness or a metallic character. Soundstaging improves with greater transparency, tighter image focus and a well-rendered soundstage depth. Your picture resolution will be sharper with less color shift. In the end, you'll get all the performances you paid for...and isn't that what it's all about?<br><br><b>Monster PowerCenters make life easier.</b><br>Monster makes the management of all your power connections easier with color-coded outlets and corresponding cord labels. And finally, Monster gives you a generous eight foot current capacity power cord which is the optimum length to reach most AC power outlets.<br><br><b>Maximize your system's performance and protection.</b><br>Enhanced system performance with component-specific power filtering...protection from polluted AC power, surges, spikes and inconvenience! Monster's Home Theatre PowerCenters meet the high performance demands of today's discriminating audiophile.<br><br><b>Multiple SurgeGuard Protects Components From Harmful surges and Spikes</b><br>Harmful power surges and voltage spikes can travel up the AC power line and damage connected equipment. Lightening, automatic garage doors, power tools, refrigerators and fluorescent lights all cause power surges and voltage spikes that affect phone lines and coax cables. Monster's Multiple SurgeGuard detects harmful power surges and voltage spikes before they reach components.<br><br>This PowerCenter HTS 2000 features special surge protection for phone lines and coax cables used for DSS, DIVX /DVD and cable TV connections. Other surge protectors can result in as much as 20 to 30dB of signal loss, which ultimately affects the output performance of coax connections. Monster's ultra-low loss RF circuitry provides virtually no signal loss to maintain peak performance. Best of all, an audible surge alarm and visual surge indicator warn you of harmful surges and let you know you're getting the most advanced protection available. <br><br><br> <b>"In my ten years as a reviewer, I've never heard as dramatic and improvement in sound quality for so little money as that rendered by Monster Cable's HTS2000." </b><br> <i> Robert Harley, The Absolute Sound Issue 118 June/July</i> <br><br> <b>AudioVideo International Audio Grand Prix Accessory of the year </b><br><br>"	0

COL title VAL "KLH 980B 100-Watt 2-Way Indoor/Outdoor Speakers (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)" COL feature VAL "Weatherized for outdoor use 4-inch polypropylene-cone woofer 1.75-inch polycarbonate cone tweeter 5-way gold-plated binding posts Includes mounting materials" COL description VAL "KLH's small, modestly priced 980B speakers have been weatherized for use both indoors and out. But simply calling them indoor/outdoor speakers doesn't quite do the 980Bs justice. These tiny satellites can be mounted nearly anyplace: boat or camper, garage or truck, patio or bathroom. You can even buy two pairs and use them as the front and surround channels in a small home-theater system. The 980Bs may be diminutive, but their all-black finish, relatively hefty weight, and high-quality driver complement make them pretty serious little speakers. Another strong point: the 980Bs come with gold-plated, five-way binding-post terminals, not the cheap clip terminals we find on most models at this price. Though the 980Bs do have high-quality parts and construction, they provide mixed results sonically. You'll want to place them up against the wall in order to reinforce the bass, which otherwise sounds too lean, robbing music of its foundation and vocals of their fullness. (We did try the 980Bs with a small subwoofer, which fleshed them out nicely.) A lean bass shifts the 980Bs' tonal balance toward the middle and high frequencies, where the speakers sound spacious and much larger than they appear. The top end is not terribly extended, but it is crisp, well defined, and free of the brightness that can induce listener fatigue. The KLH 980Bs make a fine choice for less-critical listening (such as under the eaves of your patio, on a boat, or in a camper). When using the speakers indoors, we recommend adding a subwoofer to help boost the thin bottom end. Either way, the 980Bs remain well-made and useful speakers. <i>--Wayne Garcia</i> <b>Pros:</b><br /> <b>Cons:</b><br /> "	COL title VAL "KLH 970A Indoor/Outdoor 3-Way Speakers (Discontinued by Manufacturer)" COL feature VAL "Weather resistant 3-way design Mounting brackets Works with low-power amps 90-day warranty" COL description VAL "Whether listening to music in the den, or to the ballgame on the patio, enjoy great sound quality with these 3-way Indoor/Outdoor Speakers from KLH.

It comes in a good-looking and durable brushed champagne gold case that is splash-proof, so you can shoot pictures in all kinds of weather. The 38-80mm zoom lens is perfect for framing portraits, getting in on the action, and capturing faraway subjects. The Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 offers the advanced features of Olympus's larger camera lines, including quartz date and time imprinting and a self timer. The Olympus Stylus Epic also has a whopping six flash modes, including automatic, red-eye reduction, and night scene. It also has a useful Infinity mode, which sets the focus to let you take shots of distant landscapes and other subjects. The Olympus Stylus Epic is a pleasure to use--it is as small as or smaller than many of the new Advanced Photo System (APS) cameras, but still uses standard 35mm film. Its tapered design made it easy to slip in a pocket, and since it is little larger than a deck of cards, we found ourselves carrying it everywhere. It's especially nice to have the zoom in such a compact camera. <i>--Walt Opie</i> <b>Pros:</b><ul><li>Extremely lightweight and compact<li>Durable construction<li>Wide range of flash options<li>Includes zoom</ul><b>Cons:</b><ul><li>Battery compartment is hard to open</ul>"	1

Whether hiking through the woods or traveling back roads, you always know where you are with the Magellan GPS Blazer 12 Satellite Navigator. It displays bearing, heading, distance, speed, and more on its three navigation screens. Nine coordinate and thirteen map datum systems allow you to plot your position on almost any map. Setting up the Blazer 12 was easy. We just installed the batteries and initialized the receiver by answering a few on-screen questions about our location and the time and date. The unit assumes that you already know a little about basic map reading, longitude, and latitude, but the User Manual introduces you to the Blazer 12's features in no time. It took a little over three minutes for the Blazer 12 to get a position fix after initializing. After that, marking our initial position was as easy as pressing the Mark button. We watched our precise longitude and latitude change as we walked and drove; the Blazer 12 tracked our distance as we moved. As we returned to our initial position, the Blazer 12 guided us back with the appropriate directions. The Blazer 12 is rated to last 20 hours on two alkaline batteries; ours lasted eight hours on two Ni-Cad batteries. The unit is also rated to retain its memory for 30 minutes without the batteries; we checked ours at one hour and the memory was still intact.

Item has been tested and works perfectly. Player comes with RCA A/V cables to hook to your TV! User's manual, remote and original packaging is NOT included. Satisfaction guaranteed! This Sharp VCR is an affordable alternative to high-end models that are heavy on frivolous features. This model has all the essentials, including four video heads and hi-fi stereo sound that deliver the video and audio performance you would expect from a major brand like Sharp. Advanced features include Super VHS (S-VHS) compatibility, index search, rapid rewind, and auto head cleaning. The video quality benefits from Sharp's own super-picture technology, which brings clearer, more detailed pictures by minimizing white noise during video playback. In addition, Sharp has equipped this VCR with a 19-micron video head, which preserves video and sound quality during slower recording and playback speeds. For even higher video quality, you can use Super VHS (S-VHS) tapes for playback on this model. However, it is worth noting that this unit will not record in the higher-quality S-VHS format. If you hate waiting for videotapes to rewind, this is the VCR for you. Sharp's VCH993U contains a rapid rewind feature that can take a two-hour tape from its end to beginning in about one minute. Another feature we like is the front-based audio and video jacks, which make it easy to add an additional device--such as a camcorder--without having to access the back of the unit. With strong features and a crisp, clear picture, the Sharp VCH993U is a solid value. <b>Pros:</b><br /> <b>Cons:</b><br /> "	COL title VAL "Panasonic PV-V4522 4-Head Hi-Fi VCR" COL feature VAL "4-head hi-fi VCR Front AV inputs accommodate a camcorder or gaming console Commercial Skip minimizes viewing distractions Index search and tape-position display Auto clock set with 24-hour backup" COL description VAL "When it comes to VCRs, Panasonic knows how to ensure the highest quality.

The VR646HF manifests a minimalist design philosophy--simple and elegant. We took it out of the box, connected an antenna and TV (75-ohm RF connectors), and plugged it in. An initial setup menu automatically guided us through the setup process, but we chose to setup the unit manually. We played a prerecorded tape and noticed mild interference--some lines brushing across the screen--but moving the VCR a few inches away from the TV cleared it up. The remote control is well-designed with intuitive function keys, and it worked well even when pointed away from the face of the VCR. The on-screen programming menus cover the major functions and cover them well, but you may need the manual for the advanced features, particularly VCR Plus+ setup.

It does have a database of over 15,000 cities and the capability to accept up to 500 user-defined waypoints, so it still works fairly well for giving you bearings to the next town or point of interest. We used the tracking features extensively, which let us leave a "bread crumb" trail as we traveled. This was especially helpful when we were backtracking along the same route, as we were able to easily compare our current position with the trail on the display. The display has two levels of backlighting, a feature that drains the unit's two AA batteries at a frightening rate. However, without the backlight on, we got more than 12 hours of use from the unit.<P> The GPS 315 uses simple controls that let users page through its numerous data screens. As long as we were moving the compass, the screens worked well; we especially liked the graphical compass that pointed out our current direction of travel and the bearing to a waypoint at the same time. The device can also serve as a full-fledged trip computer, measuring distance, average speed, and providing an estimated time of arrival. Perhaps the best thing about the GPS 315 is that all the data screens are fully customizable, letting users create their own data pages containing only the data they want to see. Although Magellan doesn't include a lot of goodies in the box, the GPS 315 has many optional accessories that increase its capabilities. For example, you can get a PC cable to upload topographical and street map data. Without all the extras the GPS 315 is better suited for hikers and boaters than highway travelers, but it's an accurate and inexpensive way to keep your bearings. <i>--T.

Ships with adaptor for Your Vehicle. Proper adaptor may not be pictured." COL description VAL "This is a &quot;BRAND NEW&quot; VERY HIGH END Custom 15&quot; Tapered STAINLESS Antenna Mast. What is unique about our 15&quot; mast is it&apos;s made of Spring Stainless Steel, this means that when its bent it WILL spring back to its original position. Due to higher costs to manufacture Spring Steel parts, it is extremely hard to find an antenna in todays market that will match the quality level of this antenna. Rather you will find endless options of aftermarket antenna&apos;s that will leave you shopping for another antenna once its weak construction bends, looks goofy, and stays that way. Another unique feature of our antenna is that its stainless rod is Tapered. This means at the base where it screws onto your vehicle the rod is wider and tapers to a smaller rod size at the tip. So if you are looking for a mast that has that Custom LOOK and want that Old Time High End Spring Tapered Rod Quality, this 15&quot; Mast is the one for YOU!! This is why we feel the need to express that our antenna is unique, and we are PROUD of it!! After years of testing this mast we have found that the AM/FM reception is 95% as good as the factory 32&quot; mast that your vehicle was made with. Any questions or concerns on any of our products feel free to contact us by telephone or email by clicking on AntennaMastsRus about us page here on Amazon."

Believe me, an hour on the treadmill won't seem quite as long with a Sony WM-FX195 Walkman AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player! Maybe there isn't anything peppy enough for you on the radio.. put in your favorite music cassette and get moving! The automatic volume limiter and high performance stereo headphones will ensure steady, quality sound! Sony's slim-design WM-FX195 stereo cassette player is portable enough--and, at under half a pound with batteries--light enough to go anywhere you do. In addition to playing tapes, the Walkman offers FM stereo and wideband AM radio reception. An anti-rolling mechanism maintains low wow and flutter by steadying the tape when you're running or walking, and an FM local/distant (DX) switch improves reception of fuzzy stations. The player's automatic volume limiter system (AVLS) maintains an even volume level, guarding against unintended level increases and evening the output of musical passages that vary widely in level. A switch adjusts the sound to accommodate metal-oxide tapes, and Mega Bass produces deep, rich bass tones. Automatic shut-off (in playback mode) extends battery life and helps prevent both mechanical and tape wear by turning off unit at the end of each tape side. Finally, an anti-rolling mechanism maintains stable tape speed to minimize music-distorting "wow and flutter" while the player is in motion. Supplied MDR-026 over-ear headphones offer wide dynamic range and clear sound, and the unit also comes with a belt clip. Two AA batteries provide up to 25 hours of continuous tape playback (maximum, using Sony Alkaline batteries), or up to 55 hours of FM radio reception. And in case you don't keep count of the hours, a handy LED battery indicator warns you when it's time to switch. <b>What's in the Box</b><br /> Cassette player, headphones, belt clip, and a user's manual."	1
