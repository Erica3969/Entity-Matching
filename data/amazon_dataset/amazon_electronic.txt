The durable high impact molded resin Wiremate unit protects, conceals, and eliminates wire tangles for up to 12 to 18 electrical wires, computer and tv cables, etc. Made in USA. The Wire Mate shown here is White. Wire Mat is the "no more mess" cable and wire solution for computer work stations, entertainment centers, etc. Wire Mate is Easy To Use and Install: Turn off power supply. Remove the WireMate cover by firmly pressing tips or middle of the two locking tabs at each end, while separating the cover from the base. Affix the double sided peel off tape to the four corners of the base. The tape works very well with all applications, screws are provided only as an option. Position base where wire slack will cause tangling. It can be positioned vertically, horizontally or remain free standing. Run wires through the WireMate integrated posts as the set-up illustration shows. Place cover on the base. Turn on power supply. Frequently Asked Questions: What would be the best place to mount the unit? On a flat surface closest to the tangling of slack wire. In all cases, unit may be mounted on a desk or wall near the surge protector or power source outlet. When should the tape or screws provided be used? The tape will work for all situations and is very easy and quick to do. Surface area should be clean and dry before applying the tape. If many of the wires are thick, using the screws may ensure a more secure positioning of the unit. Should the wires be placed in the unit base before mounting? It is better to first mount the unit base. Once positioned, it is easier to do the wire placement and minimize slack tangling. Is there a preferred wire looping pattern? Yes. Run the wires through the center of posts, only leaving the center to loop in the opposite direction. This will form a figure 8 pattern which will hold the wires more firmly in place."

Adjust the focus of your telescope and re-expose the star, once again showing the diffraction spike pattern.

Sturdily constructed with an aluminum screw thread, the adaptors are available in both standard and wide-angle configurations. Special sizes can be made to order. The wide-angle adaptors are designed so that the filter is placed as close as possible to the front element of the camera lens, and should be used to prevent vignetting with wide angle lenses."	COL title VAL "Lee Filters 77mm wide angle adapter ring" COL feature VAL "Lee Filters 77 W/A Adapter Ring" COL description VAL "LEE Filters Wide Angle 77mm Adapter Ring.  The adapter ring is crucial to the LEE 100mm Filters system.  It screws onto the cameras lens and the Lee 100mm FK Foundation Kit Holder is then secured to the adapter ring with the 3 part spring loaded brass wedge.  The wide angle adapter ring is suitable for use with wide angle lenses. It differs from the standard adapter ring by sitting closer to the front element of the cameras lens, as the threads are recessed into the adapter ring so that the adapter ring slightly overlaps the lens. As a result, the likelihood of vignetting is dramatically reduced. The wide angle adapter ring could really be considered a universal adapter ring as it can be used on any lens, even if it is not a wide angle lens.

Lens filters are translucent pieces of glass placed in front of a camera lens to alter or adjust the light entering the camera and more importantly to protect the camera lens. Lens filters improve photographs by giving photographers control over light and allowing them to emphasize the features of a scene that they consider most important. This filter kit is a combination of the three essential filters no photographer should be without.UV--Film and a digital CCD are more sensitive to UV light than our eyes are. This often shows up in images shot from high altitudes and long distances especially over water. This filter will remove the UV light and more importantly protect your lens from moisture, scratches, and damage. Circular Polarizer--provides color and contrast enhancement. Reflected light often shows up as a whitish glare that washes out color in an image. A polarizing filter will correct this problem creating deep blue skies. It also removes glare from non-metallic surfaces such as windows and water. FLD--provides color correction when shooting under fluorescent lighting. It will remove the greenish tint from the image, providing pleasing skin tones and true to life color renditions. Warranty:10 year manufacturer warranty.

It offers a host of special modes for specificshooting situations, including full auto, manual, night scene,portrait, landscape, and more.

The autofocus system is incredibly responsive, and includesseven focusing points that can be set individually for super creativeshooting. In other words, using the LCD panel as a guide, you can setthe camera to automatically focus on the far right focus point (or anyof the other points) so your main subject doesn't have to be in themiddle of the frame to be in focus in a snap. In fact, most settings can be adjusted in creative ways on the Rebel2000, like the exposure level, which can be set to overexpose orunderexpose up to two full stops for tricky lighting situations whereyou might want to fool the camera's metering system.

Built-in Optical SteadyShot image stabilization system makes it possible to produce sharp images even when shooting handheld in low light. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This &lsquo;bokeh&rsquo; effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. &alpha; lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped &ldquo;aspherical&rdquo; elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills. Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if you&rsquo;re using a polarizing filter. 2014 Sony Electronics Inc. All rights reserved.

This 1.8 density creates a darkening of the entire image, allowing you to photograph with a wider aperture or slower shutter speed than normally required. By slowing your exposure time or increasing your aperture, you are able to control depth of field and convey movement more easily. This filter is constructed from a high quality optical glass for high definition and clarity. It is compatible with the 100mm Filter System, which is designed for use with most lenses and camera types. This filter measures 3.9 x 3.9" / 100 x 100mm.

They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the "glass" that makes the world's greatest pictures. AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 85mm f1.8D AF Nikkor is a compact and portable medium telephoto lens ideal for indoor or outdoor portraits. An excellent choice for your first telephoto lens, it features subtle blurring of background for beautifully natural and evocative portraits, Rear Focusing system for fast and smooth optical performance, and weighs 13.2 ounces. <b>Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performance</b><br /> To enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry. <b>Rear Focusing</b><br /> With Nikon's Rear Focusing (RF) system, all the lens elements are divided into specific lens groups, with only the rear lens group moving for focusing. This makes autofocusing operation smoother and faster. <b>Distance information</b><br /> D-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70.

We just don't think you should have to work a second job or put the family heirlooms on eBay to own one. Now you won't, thanks to our amazingly affordable 80mm ED refractor. Its multi-coated 80mm objective doublet contains one element crafted from extra-low-dispersion FPL-53 glass. Images are virtually free of chromatic aberration! With a focal length of 600mm (f/7.5), the "ED80" is wonderfully suited for visual applications on both solar system and deep-sky objects as well as for prime-focus astrophotography and CCD imaging. Sold as optical tube assembly only, without accessories. Finished in gunmetal gray metallic enamel. Compatible tube rings are #7371, sold separately. One-year limited warranty. I have been looking for quick "setup and go" telescope of superior quality for a few years, and I believe I have found that scope in the Orion 80ED. This is an amazingly compact, well performing little instrument that combines all the features I have been looking for in a single package. <P>The only word for the optics is <I>superb</I>. When using the Orion 80ED to view the Moon and Planets, with magnifications at or below "Dawes Limit" (a theoretical limit to the maximum power of any telescope, 160 power in this case), I saw no false color of any kind. The contrast was excellent, and the views of the Moon and planets were tack sharp. As I increased the power beyond "Dawes Limit," I noted only the slightest hint of false color, a very slight drop in contrast, and the tiniest softening of the image. Saturn looks like a small ringed jewel sitting on black velvet, the cloud belts of Jupiter are clear colorful and sharp, and the Moon is nothing short of amazing. Deep Sky Objects show well with this instrument as well--I was able to easily see structure in the Great Nebula in Orion, and detail in the Andromeda Galaxy. <P> The Optical Tube Assembly (OTA), is one hundred millimeters in diameter, a bit larger than most instruments of this size. The focuser is a 2" aluminum Crayford-type focuser that accepts 2" or 1 &frac14;" eyepieces or accessories. I can use a 2" eyepiece for a wider field of view than I would normally get using the standard 1 &frac14;" eyepiece, this makes for fine viewing of extended objects such as Nebula and Open Star Clusters. The focusing mechanism is smooth and silky, and incorporates a focus lock along the bottom of the focuser assembly. The rubber coated 42 mm (1.6") focus control knobs on each side of the drawtube make for a good grip and easy control of focus during photography or viewing. The telescope focuser easily supports a 35-MM camera or an ST-7 CCD camera using an optional T-Ring and two-inch adapter. <P> The Dew shield is removable; this shortens the telescope's overall length from 23" to 18.75" which makes for easy storage and portability. A set of mounting rings is available from Orion as well as from third party vendors, allowing me to quickly mount the telescope on either a small Equatorial platform, or piggyback it on my much larger Nexstar11GPS telescope. This little telescope is built well, looks nice, performs well, and is small enough to take on the road. --<I>Dave Cole</I> <P> <B>Pros</B> <UL> <LI>Small and lightweight <LI>Affordable <LI>Superb optics <LI>Well constructed <LI>1 &frac14;" eyepiece adapter included </UL> <P><B>Cons</B> <UL> <LI>Tripod mounting block could be a bit larger <LI>Aperture is only 80 mm <LI>Does not come with a carry case </UL>"	COL title VAL "Orion 9829 SkyView Pro Equatorial Telescope Mount" COL feature VAL "Heavy-duty SkyView Pro equatorial mount and tripod provides a solid and stable foundation for astronomical telescope use Supports telescope tubes weighing up to 20 lbs; tubes attach via an included quick-release dovetail bar Slow-motion knobs on Declination (Dec) and Right Ascension (RA) axes allow fine manual motion control and tracking of celestial objects as they appear to migrate across the night sky Includes two counterweights (4 and 7.5 lbs) Total weight with counterweights equals 35 lbs.

Their 5 1/4-in. woofers deliver full-range output to below the built-in subwoofer crossover point for Dolby Digital receivers. They include both cloth indoor and anodized screen outdoor grilles. The keyholes on the back of Adaptor cabinets enable easy wall or corner mounting without having to purchase extra mounting brackets. They are ideal for home theater use, and all music formats. Proving that outdoor speakers can sound just as good as indoor models, the Adatto DV52si indoor/outdoor speakers boast the same components as BIC America's top-rated DV52si bookshelf speakers. This means the versatile satellites have enough bass output to fall below the built-in subwoofer crossover point for Dolby Digital receivers, ensuring that users won't miss a note whether listening to their favorite tunes on the patio or enjoying surround sound movie soundtracks in the living room. The resulting audio is warm, precise, and full-bodied, with an accuracy and tone that dwarfs speakers many times their size. The speakers mount easily on either a wall or ceiling corner, giving listeners a host of installation options. Locate them near an outdoor hot tub, under a roof eve in the garden, or above the back deck, where the weather-resistant housing will hold up to both sun and wind exposure. The speakers aren't completely waterproof, however, so BIC America recommends installing them under a covering. To further protect the speakers, the company included an anodized screen grille, which keeps water splashes and drizzle from damaging the components. When locating them indoors, merely pop off the anodized grille and add the cloth indoor grille instead. Audio-wise, each speaker boasts a 5.25-inch polypropylene cone woofer and 0.5-inch poly dome tweeter, which combine to deliver a frequency response of 70 Hz to 20 kHz. Additional specs include an 8-ohm impedance, a sensitivity of 90 dB, and a crossover frequency of 5 kHz. The speakers perform particularly well when combined with other BIC America home theater speakers, which are tonally matched to complement the Adattos and are video shielded to prevent image interference. Each speaker handles 10 to 125 watts and measures 6.25 by 9 by 6 inches (W x H x D). The pair is also backed by a seven-year warranty when used indoors and a two-year outdoor warranty. <b>What's in the Box</b><br> Two DV52si indoor/outdoor speakers, user's manual."

HDTV reception requires optional HDTV tuner and antenna or special HD cable or satellite service Bask in the widescreen glory of Sony's panoramic, high-definition-ready KV-30HS420 FD (flat display) Trinitron WEGA television. The 30-inch set offers analog and digital high-definition inputs, great audio features, and a suite of picture-enhancing technologies. Whether you're watching VHS tapes, DVDs, or high-definition (480p, 720p, 1080i) broadcasts, your programs will look breathtakingly good.<P> The set's 16:9 aspect ratio, Hi-Scan 1080i display, and picture-improvement circuitry let you view a mix of sources at high resolutions, up to 1080i. DRC--Digital Reality Creation MultiFunction circuitry--upconverts standard interlaced (480i) video sources to 960i or progressive-scan 480p, while inputs as high-quality as 720p (720 lines, progressively scanned) are upsampled to full 1080i. Because DRC processes video signals in real time, it creates an image with 4 times the density of the original signal. Sony's MID-X (Multi Image Driver) maintains the integrity of a converted signal by minimizing image loss in the scaling process.<P> Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p and 720p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts. The set's auto 16:9 enhanced mode detects anamorphically encoded widescreen program sources and offers full picture resolution on the video program, wasting none of its usable lines of resolution on the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.<P> The KV-30HS420's high-voltage regulator maintains consistent image size, despite variations in b rightness during scene changes and channel changes, while magnetic quadra-pole technology reduces "beam spot" distortion and improves corner-to-corner focus and picture sharpness.<P> ClearEdge VM wideband velocity modulation improves the definition at picture edges, creating sharper images by slowing the CRT (cathode-ray tube) beam's horizontal scanning during demanding work--say, when rendering transitions from light to dark parts of an image--and speeding it up when scanning easily rendered sections, like broad dark areas. The set's 3D digital comb filter compares each horizontal scanning line with the lines above and below it, as well as with the corresponding lines on previous and subsequent video frames. This results in higher horizontal resolution, higher vertical resolution, and reduced video noise.<P> The KV-30HS420 also employs CineMotion Reverse 3-2 PullDown technology (often called 3:2 pulldown), a handy feature for watching progressive-scan movies in their native 24-frame format. Digital video mastering introduces a common distortion when adjusting 24 frames-per-second movies to 30 fps video; 3:2 pulldown digitally corrects this distortion, removing the redundant information to display a film-frame-accurate picture.<P> Finally, Dynamic Focus circuitry automatically adjusts the picture during each scanning line for consistent corner-to-corner sharpness.<P> Two high-definition component-video inputs grant optimum connection with a DTV decoder and progressive-scan DVD player, while standard composite- and S-video inputs accommodate all DVD players. The set's HDMI interface provides a digital connection with your DTV receiver. HDMI supports standard-definition (SD), enhanced definition (ED), or high-definition (HD) video, plus multi-channel digital audio--all using a single cable.<P> Choose between rear AV inputs and a set of front AV inputs for extra convenience. A rear AV output offers a switchable fixed- and variable-level analog audio output for hookup with a surround receiver or integrated amplifier.<P> The set features stereo speakers (with 15 watts per channel) and BBE sound enhancement. You can label the set's video inputs and channels for easy selection. If you don't have Dolby Pro Logic processing or a surround speaker system, the TV's SRS TruSurround will simulate surround sound through any 2 speakers.<P> Other video technologies include auto white balance, Dynamic Picture Processor circuitry, Trinitone color temperature control, and vertical aperture compensation. An optional accessory for the set is the Sony audio/video cabinet SU-30HX1.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> TV, remote control (RM-Y188), 2 AA batteries, a user's manual, warranty information."

Creating high quality movies is easier with STM as it delivers steady and quiet continuous focusing, so your movies are smooth, and soundtracks only capture the surrounding sounds and not the noise of a focusing motor.The EF 50mm f/1.8 STM replaces the popular EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens which was affectionately known for giving outstanding picture quality at an affordable price. This latest version gives the same stunning photo quality but with a fast, near-silent focus motor and a more robust build that belies its price. <!--Amazon Aplus Start--> <div class="aplus"><!--Overview--> <h4>EF 50mm f/1.8 STM</h4> <div class="leftImage" style="width: 300px;"><img alt="EF 50mm f/1.8 STM" height="138" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/Camera/Canon/50mmf1.8/ef50_f18_stm_main._V305717329_.jpg" width="300" /></div> Compact and lightweight&mdash;an outstanding walk-around lens Canon's EF 50mm f/1.8 STM is a great entry into the world of EOS prime lenses. With an 80mm effective focal-length on APS-C cameras, 50mm on full-frame cameras, it's an excellent prime lens for portraits, action, even nighttime photography. Its bright maximum aperture of f/1.8 helps it not only to excel in low light, but also to capture gorgeous, sharp images and movies with beautiful background blur thanks to its circular 7-blade design. An updated lens arrangement with new lens coatings helps render images with excellent color balance, plus minimized ghosting and flare. Performance is brilliant, with a stepping motor (gear-type STM) to deliver near silent, continuous Movie Servo AF for movies plus speedy, smooth AF for stills. A redesigned exterior with improved focus ring placement makes manual focus adjustments a breeze. Canon's most compact 50mm lens, the EF 50mm f/1.8 STM has a rugged metal mount, plus an improved minimum focusing distance of 1.15 ft. (0.35m) and a maximum magnification of 0.21x. Offering sharp performance for the best in movies and stills, it's a fixed focal length gem&mdash;the perfect lens for photographers and moviemakers to expand the creative possibilities with their EOS cameras."	1

Features include parfocal-ization, 1" filter threads, captive lock screws that won't fall out and full multicoatings. Barlows Concept: I originally designed the Tele Vue Barlow line to complement the high performance of our eyepieces. Only 2 elements of high index glass were required to reduce all aberrations to well below the airy disc in an f/4 system. It has taken a good 15 years, but I think we're finally laying to rest the popular myth of the "degrading Barlow." In a 1997 Sky & Telescope review, Terrence Dickenson wrote "...Technology has erased the old objections. A modern Barlow will not degrade your telescope's optics. Anyone telling you otherwise is using outdated information. Moreover, the highly regarded Nagler eyepieces and their clones have built-in Barlows - ample evidence that the lens is not some detrimental intruder." Thanks Terry, I couldn't agree more. Al Nagler Properly designed Barlows do wonderful things: They amplify power, slow the telescope's f/# (improving eyepiece sharpness), and give designers the opportunity to compensate for eyepiece aberrations. Tele Vue Barlows use multi-coated high index glasses for optimum aberration correction, exceptional contrast with virtually no lightloss. Observed performance is aberration free, even"	COL title VAL "Celestron 93529 X-Cel LX 1.25-Inch 2x Barlow Lens (Black)" COL feature VAL "Quality X-Cel Lx 2X Barlow Doubles The Magnification Of Any 1.25" Eyepiece. 3-Element Apochromatic, Fully Multi-Coated Optics Offer Up Bright, Sharp Images.

COL description VAL "When inserted between the eyepiece and telescope, this X-Cel 2X Barlow lens doubles the magnification of all your 1.25" eyepieces.

The black anodized housing with orange highlights matches the eyepieces in the Celestron X-Cel LX line. A centralized rubber grip helps to keep your hands securely on the barrel, even when your fingers are cold or you are wearing gloves. A brass compression ring just inside the top of the X-Cel Barlow grabs your eyepiece gently but firmly when you turn the thumbscrew. Once the thumbscrew has been secured in place, the brass ring keeps your eyepiece in the Barlow instead of relying on the tip of the thumbscrew itself, offering a better grip and protecting the barrel from scratches. The barrel of the Celestron X-Cel LX 2x Barlow is threaded to accept 1.25" filters, allowing you to change eyepieces without removing and re-attaching the filter from each eyepiece barrel."	1

Each ocular features a monster 1-1/4"-diameter eye lens to look into. Each also has a generous 20mm of eye relief, so you'll get the big picture even if you wear eyeglasses. The optics are fully multi-coated to maximize light transmission to your eyes, and the lens edges are blackened to ensure excellent contrast. Stratus eyepieces fit in both 1.25" and 2" focusers. Each is threaded for filters and comes with protective lens caps. The ultimate in viewing comfort - this 8mm telescope eyepiece sports a monster 1-1/4"-diameter eye lens and a generous 20mm eye relief. An ideal eyepiece for high-power yet wide-field views of the Moon, planets and bright deep sky objects through a telescope. Offers a 68-degree apparent field of view for a nice and wide window into the heavens. Eyepiece optics are fully multi-coated and feature blackened lens edges for maximized light transmission and excellent contrast.

The IntelliEye optical sensor tracks movement thousands of times times per second, giving you smooth and precise motion. Without a mouse ball, there are no moving parts to clean or wear down.

Microsoft has replaced the old-fashioned mouse ball with the Wheel Mouse Optical, featuring an IntelliEye optical sensor to provide smooth and precise motion. Without a mouse ball, there are no moving parts to clean or wear down. The IntelliEye optical sensor is sealed in to keep out the dirt and lint that can cause a traditional mouse to skip or jam. The Wheel Mouse Optical comes with a scroll wheel for scrolling and zooming. Move through documents by simply rolling the wheel forward or backward instead of clicking on a scroll bar. Use the wheel to see either close-up or big-picture views without having to use menus or toolbars (in compatible applications). The mouse also features an ambidextrous design for comfort. Whether you are left-handed or right-handed, have a large or small hand, the design of the Wheel Mouse Optical feels comfortable. The Wheel Mouse Optical's IntelliEye optical sensor scans the desktop 6,000 times per second, delivering smooth, precise motion on virtually any surface, even through dirt, dust, and fingerprints. The IntelliEye sensor performs best on surfaces with detail to track. It will not function on surfaces without visible detail (e.g., glass) or surfaces where it will see its reflection (for example, mirrors or glossy surfaces).

COL title VAL "Nikon AF-S FX NIKKOR F/4D IF-ED 300mm Fixed Zoom Lens with Auto Focus for Nikon DSLR Cameras" COL feature VAL "Lens not zoomable Compact super-telephoto lens for travel, sports, wildlife, and stock photography Super-fast, super-quiet lens using Silent Wave motor technology ED glass elements for high-resolution and high-contrast images M/A mode allows rapid switching between autofocus and manual operation Nine-blade rounded diaphragm achieves a natural blur for out-of-focus elements" COL description VAL "This high-power 4.3x telephoto zoom is a versatile and lightweight answer to bringing family action closer. Fits all Nikon SLR cameras but optimized for automatic-focus models Lens-making is an art--Nikon artisans craft Nikkor optics from the finest materials, taking pride in adding their intellect and technique to bring the world's finest lenses to life. They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the "glass" that makes the world's greatest pictures. AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 300mm f4D IF-ED AF-S is a compact super-telephoto lens for travel, sports, wildlife and stock photography. It is a super fast, super quiet lens using Silent Wave motor technology, with ED glass elements for high-resolution and high-contrast images. It features a 4.8-foot closest focusing distance, M/A mode that allows rapid switching between autofocus and manual operation, and a nine-blade rounded diaphragm that achieves a natural blur for out-of-focus elements. <B>ED glass: An essential element of Nikkor telephoto lenses</b><br> Nikon developed ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass to enable the production of lenses that offer superior sharpness and color correction by minimizing chromatic aberration. Put simply, chromatic aberration is a type of image and color dispersion that occurs when light rays of varying wavelengths pass through optical glass. In the past, correcting this problem for telephoto lenses required special optical elements that offer anomalous dispersion characteristics--specifically calcium fluoride crystals. However, fluorite easily cracks and is sensitive to temperature changes that can adversely affect focusing by altering the lens' refractive index. So Nikon designers and engineers put their heads together and came up with ED glass, which offers all the benefits and none of the drawbacks of calcium fluorite-based glass. With this innovation, Nikon developed several types of ED glass suitable for various lenses. They deliver stunning sharpness and contrast even at their largest apertures. In this way, Nikkor's ED-series lenses exemplify Nikon's preeminence in lens innovation and performance. <B>Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performance</b><br> To enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry. <B>Internal Focusing</b><br> Imagine being able to focus a lens without it changing in size. Nikon's IF technology enables just that. All internal optical movement is limited to the interior of the non-extending lens barrel. This allows for a more compact, lightweight construction as well as a closer focusing distance. In addition, a smaller and lighter focusing lens group is employed to ensure faster focusing. The IF system is featured in most Nikkor telephoto and selected Nikkor zoom lenses. <B>Distance information</b><br> D-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70. Flash control; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70 cameras. <B>Silent Wave Motor</b><br> Nikon's AF-S technology is yet another reason professional photographers like Nikkor telephoto lenses. AF-S Nikkors feature Nikon's SWM which converts "traveling waves" into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that's extremely accurate and super quiet. <B>M/A mode</b><br> AF-S Nikkors feature Nikon's exclusive M/A mode, that allows switching from autofocus to manual operation with virtually no time lag--even during AF servo operation and regardless of AF mode in use. <B>What's in the Box:</b><br> Lens, 77mm snap-on front lens cap, rear lens cap LF-1, semi-soft case CL-M2."	1

Telecentric operation (field rays leave parallel to optical axis, unlike Barlow lenses which diverge rays). This is ideal for Hydrogen-alpha filter use such as with Daystar models. High performance for image amplification, CCD or film (some of the finest Earth-based planetary imaging is being done with Powermates). Flexible for visual and imaging with all types of telescopes and eyepieces. Essentially Parfocal, and with nearly constant magnification regardless of image distance behind top surface (except 5x model which increases 1x for every 35mm of image distance increase). Higher magnifications are possible with high optical performance compared to "doubling up" Barlows. For smaller instruments, using heavy 2" eyepieces with the 4X POWERMATE may cause balance issues." COL description VAL "<b> Tele Vue Barlows: "An Optically Perfect Window " </b>  Properly designed Barlows do wonderful things. First, they amplify power while retaining the eyepiece's eye-relief. Second, they slow the telescope's f/#, which improves eyepiece sharpness. Third, the designer can introduce compensations for eyepiece aberrations.  The 4X Powermate Barlow is a 4-element parfocal, compact amplifying lens system. POWERMATE consists of a negative achromatic doublet plus a positive "pupil-correcting" doublet. While it looks and functions like a Barlow, your eyepiece will operate with pupil locations where the designer intended, avoiding mismatch problems. POEWRMATE optimally mates its power to your eyepieces. No additional "interface lens" is needed, since POWERMATES have it built-in.  In addition to full multi-coating, POWERMATE includes other Tele Vue special touches such as a safety undercut on the chrome barrell, and captive lock screws that can't fall out. Tele Vue's 100% QC program at f/4 insures that POWERMATE will add dramatic power (and NOTHING ELSE) to your favorite eyepieces. If, for example, you own a 22mm Panoptic, you'll have the power of a 5.5mm with the 4X POWERMATE!  The 2" 4X POWERMATE is threaded for 48mm filters.  Dobsonian/Newtonian owners using Tele Vue's Paracorr coma corrector should place the 2.5x or 5x POWERMATE (or Tele Vue 2x or 3x 1-1/4" Barlows) into the Paracorr's 1-1/4" adapter (i.e., between the Para"	COL title VAL "Televue 31mm Nagler Type 5 2 inch Eyepiece" COL feature VAL "2" Barrel 82 degree Apparent FOV, 19mm Eye Relief, Field Stop of 42 mm 6 Elements" COL description VAL "It has now been 20 years since Tele Vue designed the original 13mm Nagler eyepiece. From then on Tele Vue has always sought ways to obtain the largest possible true fields (i.e. longer focal length) while maintaining the basic Nagler concept; 82 degree apparent field with good correction to the edge. The previous Nagler versions were not conducive to scaling to longer focal lengths. A totally innovative design using four different exotic glass types (some larger than the 70mm Pronto objective!) in a 6 element configuration, opened the door to the largest true field possible in the Nagler eyepiece family. With fewer elements, Tele Vue also retained the high contrast achieved on the Radians and Nagler Type 4s. Although the sheer size and element shapes preclude using an "instadjust" eyeguard, the eye- relief is quite comfortable and the weight was actually kept below that of the 20mm Nagler Type 2! The true field is, however, more than 50% wider (or 2.35x the area). Tele Vue hopes the 31mm Nagler Type 5 gives you as much of a "spacewalk" jolt as the original 13mm Nagler did 20 years ago."	1

As a matter of fact, we invented the category. Over these years we've seen our cases used for some fairly crazy activities...and important ones too. Pelican Cases have been thrown out of helicopters in Iraq, floated through frigid fjords in Norway and rolled over by SUVs in Tanzania. With only a few scratches to show on the outside, contents inside are left unscathed. These are minor details for major bragging rights. And that is really what it's all about. Getting your gear from point A to point B in the condition it's meant to be in: intact and functional. Because it might contain a large format camera that will shoot next month's magazine cover or a heart defibrillator that could save a person's life, you can't put a price on it.   The secret is the tongue and groove fit with a polymer o-ring acting as a waterproof seal. Automatic Pressure Equalization Valve releases built-up air pressure while keeping water molecules out, resulting in a watertight case that is even easier to open. Stainless steel ball bearing wheels last longer and ride smoother. The nylon hub adjacent to the stainless steel is made to resist heat. The result is less wear and tear on the polyurethane wheel. Stainless steel hasp protectors are a Pelican exclusive. The Double-Throw latches are smarter and easier to open: it's the classic "C" clamp design with a secondary movement that works like a pry bar to start the release and offers plenty of leverage to open with a light pull. Custom engraved nameplates are available for a nominal fee. Stainless steel reinforced padlock protectors provide added strength and extra security against cutting and theft. "	1

COL title VAL "Philips LX3500D DVD Home Theater System" COL feature VAL "Theater system with progressive-scan DVD/CD player, five satellite speakers, a powered subwoofer, and 200 watts total system power Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel surround decoding for discrete, immersive DVD surround sound 40 FM/AM station presets All necessary speaker cables, interconnects, and wall brackets included Offers a choice of two colors of speaker grilles (beige and tangerine)" COL description VAL "The ideal theater for homes with standard or high-definition televisions, the Philips LX3500D consists of a Dolby Digital/DTS-decoding surround sound receiver with an integrated single-disc progressive-scan DVD/CD player, five satellite speakers, and a powered subwoofer. The DVD drive reads DVD, DVD+RW, and VCD, as well as CD, CD-R, CD-RW, and MP3 CDs. A full onscreen display simplifies setup and operation. If you're using (or plan to use) a high-definition or HD-ready TV, you'll appreciate the system's progressive scanning, which is referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image. This feature creates a picture with twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD image, providing sharper, higher resolution images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts. The LX3500D also offers 3:2 pulldown. DVD mastering introduces a common distortion when adjusting 24 frames-per-second movies to 30 fps video; 3:2 pulldown corrects this distortion to display a film-frame-accurate picture. Composite- and S-video outputs ensure compatibility with nearly any television. The system's 25-watts-per-channel receiver and 75-watt subwoofer, deliver a total of 200 watts of home theater power, and the five satellites are acoustically designed to match the receiver's tonal characteristics. The front left, right, and center speakers are magnetically shielded to prevent interference with your TV's image. The sixth speaker is a 75-watt subwoofer with a side-firing woofer. The tuner offers 40 FM/AM presets. The receiver features two analog-audio inputs and one analog-audio output, along with two digital-audio inputs (one each coaxial and optical). Three video inputs and three video outputs accommodate your monitor and other video components. Philips' use of distinct colors for each speaker cable and for each terminal on the speaker and the receiver greatly simplifies speaker setup. The package contains a full-function remote control, batteries, operational manual, AM and FM antennas, a quick-installation card, six loudspeakers, speaker cable (left/right: two nine-foot lengths; center: nine feet; surround: two 33-foot lengths), a subwoofer interconnect, a digital-audio interconnect, and a composite-video cable."	0

Good condition. Screen &amp; click wheel, buttons and lock still work perfectly. Battery does not last - you have to keep it plugged in via Firewire. Ships with original cable. No headphones. Scratches on back plate. The OS, headphone jack and unit still function fine. <b>Special note to customers:</b> An iPod software update (version 1.1) is available on the Apple site. It adds a contacts menu to store your address book and a new equalizer with more than 20 presets and independent settings for each song. Packing 1,000 songs and a 10-hour battery into a stunning 6.5-ounce package, the Apple iPod is the smallest hard drive-based MP3 player available, about the size of a deck of cards. Just plug it into your Mac and all your iTunes songs and playlists are automatically downloaded into iPod at blazing FireWire speed. The 5 GB hard drive stores up to 1,000 MP3 song files (at 160 Kbps encoding rate) and also doubles as disk storage for applications and other files. A high-output (60-mW) amplifier provides CD-quality sound with a wide dynamic range, from deep, pulse-pounding bass to sharp, crystal-clear highs. In addition to its 5 GB hard drive, iPod has a 32MB memory cache. The cache is made up of solid-state memory, meaning that it has no moving parts, so it's not affected by movement of the device. Skip protection on the iPod works by continually preloading up to 20 minutes of music into the cache. The iPod has a large, high-quality liquid crystal display (LCD) for viewing up to six lines of text. And the LCD features a white-light-emitting diode (LED) backlight for clear visibility in low-light situations--indoors or outdoors. Pocket-sized and just 6.5 ounces, it weighs appreciably less than the stack of CDs it can store music from. Featuring Apple's award-winning iTunes 2 software, the iPod can synchronize with newly added music files and playlists. Simply plug the iPod back into your Mac and the changes are automatically updated in seconds. And with iTunes 2, you can rip MP3s, create playlists, and burn custom CDs all from one simple interface. Its rechargeable lithium battery is charged using the FireWire cable when connected to your Mac. You can also recharge the iPod using the included FireWire cable and AC adapter when you're on the go. The iPod supports MP3 (up to 320 Kbps), MP3 Variable Bit Rate (VBR), WAV, and AIFF files, and is firmware upgradable. To use the iPod with your Mac, you'll need a FireWire port and you must be running either Mac OS 9.2.1 (or later) or Mac OS X v10.1 (or later). The iPod is not compatible with Windows operating systems. It comes with earbud-style headphones, a FireWire cable, power adapter, and CD-ROM with iTunes 2. It's backed by a 90-day limited warranty."

That's why Verbatim's been recognized as the No. 1 Optical Brand in the World*--we consistently provide optical media of the highest quality and compatibility. When drive manufacturers test their products for maximum performance, they use Verbatim--so why wouldn't you? Mitsubishi Kagaku Media (MKM), Verbatim's parent company in Japan, brings extensive technological research and development to the table. Core technologies, like the AZO recording layer give Verbatim an offering like no other optical manufacturer. This unique and ultra-stable layer strongly resists UV light, withstands high laser and rotation speeds on newer drives and ensures compatibility with current DVD standards. Verbatim's AZO recording layer not only withstands the extremely high laser and rotation speeds of newer drives, it also maximizes their performance. Verbatim paid particular attention to the durability and light fastness of AZO; tests show that it is more stable than most recording dyes and the least affected by ultraviolet light. AZO also offers high sensitivity for reliable high-speed recording and high reflectivity to eliminate read errors. The thinness of the recording layer is also critical. The thinner the layer, the higher the sensitivity and power margin; therefore, the better the DVD works for high-speed recording. What does all this mean for you? Verbatim AZO technology translates into optical products that cost just a little more but are worth the slight difference. They are products you want-offering reliability, high read and write performance, high-quality photos and sound and superior archival protection that lasts. <b><u>Features</u></b><br /> <i>Warranty</i> - Verbatim manufactures our DVDs to meet our strict quality standards.

The perfect lens for the photographer on the go, the fast f2 maximum aperture makes this ideal for low light, hand-held shooting. It also weighs an exceptionally light 7.2 ounces and boasts a 0.85-foot close focusing distance. <B>Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performance</b><br> To enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry. <B>Distance information</b><br> D-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100 and D70s/D70.

Indulge in exceptional digital entertainment ? the DVP-NC665P/B. Sony's five-disc, progressive-scan DVP-NC665P/B DVD player gives you all the convenience of a carousel changer--continuous playback, play exchange, dual-format DVD/CD performance--as well as quality features like progressive-scan outputs with Precision Cinema Progressive technology and cool enhancements like Sony's Precision Drive 2 system for playing damaged discs. The DVP-NC665P/B plays just about any disc out there, from DVD-Video to DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, and DVD+RW, in addition to playing hours of music from MP3 files burned to CD-R/CD-RW discs.<P> Whether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of "someday," the DVP-NC665P/B stands ready to deliver the full potential of your DVDs through Sony's Precision Cinema Progressive de-interlacer (scanning) with 3:2 pulldown processing. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.<P> Precision Cinema Progressive technology uses a 12-bit video DAC (digital-to-analog converter) with 108 MHz processing to detect image changes at the pixel level, rather than at the level of whole scan lines. That makes this player's picture more faithful to the source--whether film or video--because it uses separate, optimized algorithms to handle different pixel behaviors. Separate algorithms are also used to process the moving and still parts of an image, resulting in sharp backgrounds with moving objects that are free from motion artifacts.<P> DVD mastering introduces a common distortion when adjusting 24-frames-per-second movies to 30 fps video; 3:2 pulldown digitally corrects this distortion, removing the redundant information to display a film-frame-accurate picture. Composite- and S-video outputs bring compatibility with nearly any television.<P> Both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel surround-sound signals can also be routed through the player's digital-audio outputs (one each of RCA coaxial and Toslink optical) for a simpler connection to a compatible AV receiver (but be aware that digital-audio interconnects are not supplied).<P> Precision Drive 2 provides a mechanism for reading DVDs that are in less-than-perfect condition, eliminating errors in playback due to imperfect, scratched, or warped discs. Past generations of Precision Drive technology were only able to compensate for warped discs by moving the entire optical block, which took more time and limited the amount of correction possible. This newer system simplifies the process by moving just the lens (instead of the entire optical block) for faster and more accurate error correction.<P> As soon as you hook up the DVD player, a special Quick Setup screen appears ready to guide you through configuration, step by step, screen by screen. DVD resume memory kicks in whenever you stop a DVD. Later, when you come back to it, the player will pick up right where you left off before. The player holds resume points for up to six discs.<P> Other playback features include 10-second instant replay, DVD/CD Text display (with applicable discs), a digital video enhancer, digital video EQ (equalization), custom parental control memory for 40 discs, as well as Advanced SmoothScan and SmoothSlow Modes.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD player, remote control, 2 AA batteries, a stereo analog audio/composite-video interconnect, a user's manual, and warranty information."

This versatile unit plays DVDs and a variety of older disc formats, such as VCD and SVCD, as well as your favorite music CDs. And since the unit supports HDMI connections, you're sure to get the best picture possible. <b>HDMI Compatible</b><br> High-Definition Multi-media Interface (HDMI) is an interface format that provides uncompressed digital audio and video directly to a digital television. It represents the current state of the art in high-definition video and sound because the information never has to be converted into an analog format. Another benefit of HDMI is that it puts all that information into one cable and one easy-to-use connector. An added benefit of connecting the DVP-NC85H/B to your set with HDMI is that the unit can "upscale" commercial DVDs, which are rendered at 480p resolution, to a digitally interpolated 720p resolution, which makes for a much sharper picture. For analog sets, the DVP-NC85H/B includes a 108 MHz 12-bit digital-to-analog converter for sharp picture and clear action. It features composite, S-video and component video connectors, as well as optical digital, coaxial digital, and RCA analog audio outputs. <b>Precision Cinema Progressive</b><br> While other DVD players detect image changes at the scan line level, Sony's Precision Cinema Progressive (PCP) system detects them at the pixel level. This makes the picture more faithful to the source--whether film or video--because the technology uses separate, optimized algorithms to handle the differing pixel behavior. It also uses separate algorithms to process the moving and still parts of an image, resulting in sharp backgrounds with moving objects that are virtually free from motion artifacts. <b>Precision Drive 3 System </b><br> Sony's DVP-NC85H/B delivers excellent picture and sound quality--even from damaged discs. How? The unit's Precision Drive 3 system allows you to playback some DVDs that may have been damaged or warped without a degradation of picture quality. This feature comes in handy when watching rentals or other heavily used discs. <b>MP3 and JPEG File Playback</b><br> The DVP-NC85H/B plays MP3 sound files and JPEG photo files.

Why risk it with cheap "mystery" memory? When you buy memory from Crucial, you're buying the same high-quality memory that leading computer manufacturers install in the systems they sell. In fact, because Crucial is a division of Micron, one of the world's largest DRAM manufacturers, chances are good that you have their memory in your system right now. While the "other guys" might claim to manufacture memory, they really just assemble modules out of chips made by someone else. Some don't have first-class assembly procedures, and some even use chips that failed to meet computer manufacturer's stringent testing requirements. Crucial memory goes through much more rigorous testing procedures than many other brands of memory. Some memory assemblers choose to accept a certain "defect rate" because it's cheaper to deal with returns than to test every part they sell. That may help their bottom line, but it's sure a pain in the neck if you're one of the customers who ends up with a bad module. That's why Crucial thoroughly tests EVERY module they sell and put their name only on the ones that meet their strict standards. You might expect memory this good to cost a lot more, but you'd be wrong. As an online memory upgrade provider selling directly from the manufacturer, Crucial memory is often available at lower prices than lower-quality modules."	0

The power-save circuit automatically places the radio in a sleep mode if no signal has been transmitted or received for several seconds. A backlit LCD screen displays all 12 functions, including the channel, privacy code, battery strength, and key-lock status. However, the small text read-out can be hard to read in dim light. Impressively compact and solidly designed with soft rubber covers for the accessory and charge jacks to keep dirt and moisture out, the 75-515 has call and talk buttons conveniently positioned for any right-hander's easy use. We appreciated the concise owner's manual, which provided a guide to using the functions (channel change, monitor, and scan busy and open channels) and to setting memory channels for faster contacts. Other benefits to enjoy are hands-free operation (just set the VOX sensitivity level) and a babysitter mode (also voice activated). We found that replacing the unit's back after battery replacement was a bit tricky, and the hinged rubber jack covers (for microphone and earphone/headset) are vulnerable to damage. But that shouldn't diminish from the overall positives of the 75-515's feature set--collected in an affordable package. <b>Pros:</b><br> <ul> <li>Stay in contact in the wilderness, on vacation, at the mall <li>Lightweight and very compact </ul> <b>Cons:</b><br> <ul> <li>Battery cover tricky to replace <li>Hinged rubber jack covers are vulnerable to damage </ul>"	COL title VAL "Belkin PureAV AV23001-25 25-Foot 16-Gauge Speaker Cable &amp; Pins (Discontinued by Manufacturer)" COL feature VAL "16-gauge cables deliver crisp, natural sound to enhance your home theater experience 99.99%-purity copper conductors for improved clarity Precision-formulated, polyethylene dielectric material generates better high frequencies 4 corrosion-resistant, 24k gold speaker pins for increased durability Lifetime warranty" COL description VAL "Delivers better audio clarity and a more natural sounding midrange with superior-grade 99.99% purity copper conductorsGenerates better high-frequencies and a more realistic stereo image using precision formulated polyethylene dielectric materialCreates precise contact and increased durability with 4 corrosion-resistant 24k gold speaker pinsOffers maximum durability and long life with abrasion-resistant flexible PVC jacket25' Using advanced engineering methods and the highest-quality materials, these 16-gauge PureAV Blue Series Speaker Cables from Belkin deliver crisp, natural sound to enhance your home theater experience.

With its WEGA-styled chassis, Sony's SLV-D350P is the perfect high-convenience complement to today's silvery home-entertainment components. This versatile combination deck offers the convenience of VHS recording and playback and high-end progressive-scan DVD performance, handling just about any conceivable media format, from VHS and S-VHS tapes (which it plays at standard VHS resolution) to DVD-Video, video-mode DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, and DVD+RW, as well as MP3 CD and JPEG picture CD. From your library of VHS videos to your digital music files and digital photos, the SLV-D350P lets you enjoy them all in the comfort of your living room or bedroom.<P> Whether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of "someday," the SLV-D350P can deliver the full potential of your DVDs. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts. Other DVD functions include bookmarking, picture zoom, parental lock, and a screen saver.<P> The VCR section offers one-month, eight-event advance programming to commercial skip. Your camcorder or gaming console plugs right into the front panel for hassle-free connections. Its four-head design ensures smooth slow-motion play (forward and reverse) and clear still-frame images, and with hi-fi sound the unit records and plays back stereo audio tracks. Its 19-micron heads deliver the clearest possible picture when recording or viewing in EP (extended-play) mode.<P> Commercial skip makes it easier than ever to zip past commercials and unwanted "coming attractions," jumping forward 30 seconds for every press of the commercial-skip button.<P> Connections with combo units are often inconvenient, forcing you to use separate video hookups for each section (DVD, VCR), a problem for older TVs. This player has it figured out: a single RF or composite-video connection to a television will display either the DVD or the VCR signal, depending on which format you're viewing. If you want to view DVDs in S-video or in component-video (either interlaced or progressive-scan), you will need to use two inputs, as the device will not upconvert the signal from the VCR to either of those higher-resolution formats. Not to worry, though: any component- or S-video-equipped TV will offer sufficient inputs for both of the SLV-D350P's formats.<P> It's a different arrangement for audio: you can listen through a single set of stereo analog-audio cables for each component (one is supplied), or--if you want to enjoy DVDs in discrete 5.1-channel surround sound--you can send the DVD's audio to a compatible <a href="/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/172561/${0}">audio/video receiver</a> and a multichannel <a href="/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/3025451/${0}">speaker system</a> through a digital-audio interconnect (either optical or coaxial, not supplied).

Remove the lens from your camera and attach the T-ring in its place. Since the T-ring is camera-brand specific, it will snap right on just like a lens. Next, remove the diagonal and visual back from the rear cell of your telescope. Screw the Celestron T-Adapter onto the rear cell threads until secure. Now, thread the T-ring & camera onto the T-Adapter. Thats all there is to it. The camera is now using your telescope as a giant telephoto lens.

City scenes, crowded markets, historical ruins . . . all of these are subjects that can benefit from the wide perspectives this lens provides. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This &lsquo;bokeh&rsquo; effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. &alpha; lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped &ldquo;aspherical&rdquo; elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. The distance encoder plays an integral part in ADI flash metering, which delivers high precision flash metering that is unaffected by the reflectance of subjects or backgrounds. The distance encoder is a lens component that directly detects the position of the focusing mechanism, and sends a signal to the CPU in order to measure distance to the subject. During flash photography, this data is very useful in calculating how much flash output is appropriate to the scene. Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if you&rsquo;re using a polarizing filter. 2008 Sony Electronics, Inc. All rights reserved.

Coated optics were pioneered by Carl Zeiss<sup></sup> - and this superb lens features the Carl Zeiss T* (T-Star) coating that virtually eliminates lens flare, internal reflection and light scattering that can otherwise occur at glass-to-air surfaces. The T* coating contributes to outstanding image quality, with high contrast and uniformly excellent resolution right out to the image edges. Not simply applied to any lens - the T* symbol only appears on multi-element lenses in which the required performance has been achieved throughout the entire optical path, therefore guaranteeing the highest quality.

This camcorder borrows most of those cameras' professional-quality components and puts them into a more compact, affordable camera. Though it's small enough to carry around and doesn't cost much more than a top-of-the-line consumer camcorder, the GL2 produces such high-quality results that it could be used as a broadcast video camera. The Canon GL2 (like its predecessor, the GL1, and its big brother, the XL1) is helping to blur the line between consumer and professional video equipment. This camcorder borrows most of those cameras' professional-quality components and puts them into a more compact, affordable camera. Though it's small enough to carry around and doesn't cost much more than a top-of-the-line consumer camcorder, the GL2 produces such high-quality results that it could be used as a broadcast video camera. <B>The 3 CCD System</B> <br> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/3ccd.gif" align="right"> The GL2 maximizes the capability of the DV format by using a 3 CCD (charge-coupled device) system with a separate CCD for each primary color (red, green, blue). A beam-splitting prism separates light passing through the lens into individual color components and each is sent to its own CCD. Compared to a single CCD, the 3 CCD system achieves outstanding detail with highly accurate color reproduction suitable for the demands of high-end video production - wide dynamic range, low color noise, high-contrast detail, natural color resolution and low-aliasing. The 3 CCD system also makes advanced Pixel Shift (for increased image quality) and Low Light Recording (for increased flexibility) possible. <B>Professional L-Series Fluorite Lens </B><br> Canon has satisfied the demands of experienced image makers for years through the power, design and quality of 35mm and broadcast TV lenses. Canon's Professional L-Series lenses utilize Fluorite, a material which provides outstanding resolution, contrast, and color reproduction- especially in lightweight, high-magnification lenses. Incorporated into the lens on the GL2, Fluorite delivers the ultimate in clarity and image quality. The Fluorite element inside the lens defeats color aberration -- the effect when the components of light stray from one another within a lens, causing a reduction in sharpness, contrast and color. The Fluorite lens precisely controls components of light providing an excellent balance of these three critical ingredients of picture quality. This is unobtainable with conventional optical glass. <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/gl2-fluorite.gif" hspace="15" align="left"> To further improve image detail, Canon has intentionally shifted the green CCD (which contains 60 percent of the picture detail) half a pixel horizontally and vertically. This shift allows more accurate interpolation, resulting in an image that Canon claims rivals those from cameras with 410,000-pixel CCDs. Each pixel is 72 square microns, which is about 1.5 times the size as those in competing camcorders. This increased size increases light sensitivity, allowing you to shoot in low-light situations.  All this results in outstanding detail, with highly accurate color reproduction suitable for the demands of high-end video production. The GL2 also incorporates a 20x Professional L-Series fluorite optical zoom lens, which is equivalent to 39.5-790mm, as well as a 100x digital zoom. <B>Audio</B><br> The GL2's omni-directional microphone is designed to deliver realistic stereo sound. Using the GL2's advanced accessory shoe expands your audio options. Audio can be recorded in 16-bit mode on two channels on one track. Alternatively, audio can be record in 12-bit mode, where the audio track is divided into two, and two channels of audio are recorded onto one track, with the other left over for audio dubbing. <B>Optical Image Stabilizer</B><br> <img hspace="7" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/gl2-image-stab.gif" align="right"> Canon's superb optical stabilization system corrects camera shake instantly so even hand held shots, at full telephoto, and shots taken from a moving car, are smooth and steady. And since it is optical, there is no loss of image quality inevitable with electronic image stabilizers. It perfectly complements the high picture quality of the DV format. <p clear=left> <B>Digital Stills</B><br> You can turn your GL2 into a still camera by switching to 1.7-megapixel photo mode and capturing high-resolution still images onto the camcorder's MultiMedia/Secure Digital card. (One 8 MB Secure Digital card is included with the GL2.) The full-frame images are free from time-lag blur. A six-blade circular iris, as found on Canon's top-of-the-line XL1 and XL1S models, is used for professional exposure control, helping to deliver stunning video and still photos. <B>Inputs and Outputs</B><br> The GL2 comes with the standard DV IEEE 1394 port (also known as FireWire) for a super-fast, lossless connection to a PC or other DV machines. You can also connect to your PC via a USB connection to download still photos. The GL2 is designed to handle two types of analog input and output: using audio/video cables (composite) or S-video. Both connections are on the camera back. <B>More Features</B><br><ul> <li>Three shooting modes: normal movie mode, digital photo mode, and the cinema-like frame movie mode. <li>The Custom Key function lets you create and save your own custom settings so your common shooting modes can be readily duplicated. <li>Digital effects are offered for a greater imaging variety, including fader, sepia, strobe motion, and black and white. <li>With the Interval Timer function, you can record for a selected time with a selected interval--convenient for nature observations such as flowers or sunsets. </ul> <B>MiniDV Format</B><br> The Canon GL2 digital video camcorder uses the standard MiniDV cassette, producing the highest quality video possible from nonbroadcast equipment. The MiniDV format standard delivers more than 500 lines of horizontal resolution. And, because it records both video and audio as digital data, this information can be transferred--without any loss of picture or audio quality--to a computer for editing, then transferred back to DV tape, without a reduction in either picture or audio quality."

This camcorder borrows most of the professional-quality components from the XL1 and puts them into a more compact, affordable camera. Though it's small enough to carry around and doesn't cost much more than a top-of-the-line consumer camcorder, the GL1 produces such high-quality results that it could be used as a broadcast video camera. Great movies start with great CCD sensors, and Canon cuts no corners here. For the best possible picture quality, they use three separate 270,000-pixel CCDs (one for each primary color). To further improve image detail, Canon has intentionally shifted the green CCD half a pixel horizontally and vertically. This shift allows more accurate interpolation, resulting in an image that Canon claims rivals those from cameras with 410,000-pixel CCDs. Each pixel is 72 square microns, which is about 1.5 times the size as those in competing camcorders. This increased size increases light sensitivity, allowing you to shoot in lower-light situations. Ultimately, the larger pixel size results in an improvement of 4 dB loss budget in sensitivity. For great optical quality, the GL1 uses a fixed (nonremovable) 20x optical (100x digital) zoom L-series fluorite lens. The fluorite element in the lens increases sharpness and contrast, as well as helping to preserve color fidelity. Audio is recorded through the built-in microphone, which features two pairs of pickup elements. Audio can be recorded in 16-bit mode on two channels on one track. Alternatively, audio can be record in 12-bit mode, where the audio track is divided into two, and two channels of audio are recorded onto one track, with the other left over for audio dubbing. The electronics of the GL1 have many advanced features, including a number of programmed AE modes, as well as both shutter and aperture priority modes. There are two different auto modes, one of which allows you to adjust any setting manually, if you want, and the other, which adjusts every setting automatically and lets you adjust nothing. A spotlight mode automatically compensates for lighting difficulties when shooting a subject bathed in a spotlight. Finally, a sand-and-snow mode is designed to prevent dark, underexposed subjects in situations with bright backgrounds--commonly found in sandy and snowy areas. There are also three different shooting modes: normal movie mode, digital photo mode, and frame movie mode. Normal movie mode is for any time you want to shoot video footage. Digital photo mode records a still image for six seconds on the miniDV tape, and also captures any audio, such as a commentary. The frame movie mode records 30 still images per second, but it isn't intended to be used for shooting video. Rather, frame movie mode should be used as burst or continuous shooting mode, as you'd find on a still camera. The GL1 uses an IEEE 1394 port for digital editing and for transferring footage to and from other IEEE 1394-compliant devices. The camcorder also has RCA (composite) audio and video ports, and an S-Video out. The analog inputs allow you to transfer old footage to DV for archiving. Built-in effects include a fader for transitions, black and white, slim, stretch, and strobe. Picture adjustment is also possible; you can adjust camera sharpness, softening or sharpening your subject, as well as the color tone and how dark or light the camera sets the auto-exposure level."	1

Choose from 8 finishing styles, including Standard, Vivid, Potrait, Landscape, Night View, Sunset, B&amp;W, and Adobe RGB, and fine tune them to your personal taste with the ability to adjust contrast, saturation, and sharpness settings. <br /> <br /> <table align="left" width="350" cellpadding="3"><tr><td><img border="0" alt="Sony Alpha DSLR Features" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/photo/sony/alpha.drange.jpg"></td></tr> <tr><td><center><b><i><small>Sony's Dynamic Range Optimizer in action</i></b></small></center></td></tr></table> <strong>Dynamic Range Optimizer</strong><br /> Dynamic Range Optimizer provides two levels--Standard/Plus to improve results with backlit subjects and recover details hidden in shadows or lost in glare. Normal DRO improves detail using standard gamma curves for fast shot-to-shot response time, while Advanced DRO adjusts dynamic range area-by-area for greater accuracy. <br /> <br /> <strong>Built-in Pop-Up Flash</strong><br /> The Auto Pop-Up Flash automatically pops up and fires as needed when the camera is set to certain scene selection modes, helping first-time DSLR photographers shoot more effectively. In addition, the a380 features an integrated hot shoe, which lets you expand your lighting options with a range of accessory flashes (sold separately). <br /> <br /> <table align="right" width="350" cellpadding="3"><tr><td><img border="0" alt="Sony Alpha DSLR Features" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/photo/sony/alpha.dust.2.jpg"></td></tr> <tr><td><center><b><i><small>Anti-Dust Technology keeps your pictures dust-free</i></b></small></center></td></tr></table> <strong>Anti-Dust Technology</strong><br /> Anti-Dust Technology helps keep the CCD imager clean, resulting in consistently better pictures, by utilizing a static-free anti-dust coating on the CCD filter, as well as an anti-dust vibration that automatically shakes the CCD to help dislodge dust each time the camera is shut off. <br /> <br /> <strong>Stamina Battery power </strong><br /> Stamina Battery power allows you to take up to 500 shots on a fully charged NP-FM50 InfoLITHIUM battery when using the optical viewfinder mode, and you&rsquo;ll be able to see how much power remains in percentage increments, so you can keep shooting in confidence. <br /> <br /> <strong>Smart Teleconverter 2x Digital Zoom</strong><br /> Smart Teleconverter 2x Digital Zoom lets you zoom in electronically on your subject and reproduces pixels on a 1:1 basis so there&rsquo;s no degradation in picture quality. One touch zooms in at 1.4X, while the second touch advances to 2x zoom -- creating the 35mm equivalent of a telephoto effect with the camera&rsquo;s standard 18-55mm optical zoom lens. <br /> <br /> <strong>BIONZ image processor</strong><br /> The advanced BIONZ image processor uses hardware-based Large Scale Integrated (LSI) circuitry to enhance images with rich tonal reproduction, reduced noise, and improved white balance and exposure control, for clear, sharp photos even at high sensitivity settings. <br /> <br /> <strong>PhotoTV HD compatibility</strong><br /> PhotoTV HD compatibility lets you automatically create high-resolution thumbnails optimized for viewing on a compatible Sony BRAVIA HDTV. <br /> <br /> <strong>Scene Selection Modes</strong><br /> Scene Selection Modes optimize camera settings for different shooting situations.

This versatile unit plays DVDs and a variety of older disc formats, such as VCD and SVCD, as well as your favorite music CDs. And since the unit supports HDMI connections, you're sure to get the best picture possible. <b>HDMI Compatible</b><br> High-Definition Multi-media Interface (HDMI) is an interface format that provides uncompressed digital audio and video directly to a digital television. It represents the current state of the art in high-definition video and sound because the information never has to be converted into an analog format. Another benefit of HDMI is that it puts all that information into one cable and one easy-to-use connector. An added benefit of connecting the DVP-NC85H/B to your set with HDMI is that the unit can "upscale" commercial DVDs, which are rendered at 480p resolution, to a digitally interpolated 720p resolution, which makes for a much sharper picture. For analog sets, the DVP-NC85H/B includes a 108 MHz 12-bit digital-to-analog converter for sharp picture and clear action. It features composite, S-video and component video connectors, as well as optical digital, coaxial digital, and RCA analog audio outputs. <b>Precision Cinema Progressive</b><br> While other DVD players detect image changes at the scan line level, Sony's Precision Cinema Progressive (PCP) system detects them at the pixel level. This makes the picture more faithful to the source--whether film or video--because the technology uses separate, optimized algorithms to handle the differing pixel behavior. It also uses separate algorithms to process the moving and still parts of an image, resulting in sharp backgrounds with moving objects that are virtually free from motion artifacts. <b>Precision Drive 3 System </b><br> Sony's DVP-NC85H/B delivers excellent picture and sound quality--even from damaged discs. How? The unit's Precision Drive 3 system allows you to playback some DVDs that may have been damaged or warped without a degradation of picture quality. This feature comes in handy when watching rentals or other heavily used discs. <b>MP3 and JPEG File Playback</b><br> The DVP-NC85H/B plays MP3 sound files and JPEG photo files.

Photographers normally shooting a 300mm frame handheld at 1/500 second can obtain the equivalent result with a shutter speed of just 1/60 second, vastly extending options in low-light conditions. Gyro sensors detect unwanted vibrations, triggering the corresponding movement of a correcting lens group perpendicular to the optical axis. This alters the light path, returning the image to its correct position on the sensor or film plane. The EF 70-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM provides 2-mode IS for shooting immobile subjects. Mode 1 stabilizes the image along both the horizontal and vertical axes. For shooting while panning to follow a moving subject, Mode 2 turns off correction in the panned direction and prevents the effect of dragging the subject back through the frame. IS switches off automatically when the camera is mounted on a tripod, thus preventing feedback loops between the IS sensor and stabilizer motor vibrations. <strong>Superb autofocus</strong><br /> The micro USM motor found in the EF 70-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM employs ultra-sonic frequency vibrations to drive auto focus with unrivalled speed and near-silent operation. Good holding torque stops the lens with precision and accuracy, the instant it arrives at the correct focus point and without overshoot. A high-speed CPU and optimised AF algorithm result in a significant increase of AF speed compared to that of its predecessor. A zoom ring locking mechanism is provided that locks the zoom at the wide-angle setting. This ensures that the lens is carried or stored in its most compact position, preventing possible damage caused by the lens extending and hitting obstacles when being carried mounted on a camera with a strap. <strong>Pleasing defocused background</strong><br /> The EF 70-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM employs an electro-magnetic diaphragm (EMD) with a circular aperture. This helps create an attractive, even defocused background when isolating a subject at large apertures. <strong>Image quality</strong><br /> By optimizing Super Spectra lens coatings and lens element shaping, Canon's engineers have been effective in suppressing flare and ghosting--more prone to occur with digital cameras due to reflection off the image sensor. By increasing light absorption, coatings reduce reflections off lens element surfaces to deliver crisp, undistorted images with natural color balance. Focal length translates to 112-480mm equivalent in 35mm film format when fitted to EOS 20D and EOS 350D cameras. <strong>The EOS system</strong><br /> The EF 70-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM includes distance metering information, providing compatibility with the E-TTL II flash system of late model cameras such as the EOS-1D Mark II N and EOS 5D. When used in conjunction with Canon's range of EX Speedlite flash units, the lens passes distance information to the flash algorithm for markedly improved flash exposure metering. Accessories for the EF 70-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM include the lens hood ET-65B and the lens pouch LP1222* (*these accessories must be purchased separately). In keeping with Canon's Kyosei philosophy of living in harmony with the environment, the lens features only lead-free glass."

The large circular aperture produces a shallow depth-of-field, creating background blur that draws attention to the photographic subject. The lens construction includes UD and aspherical elements, which deliver impressive image quality throughout the entire zoom range. Image Stabilizer lens groups shift to compensate for camera movement so that the image appears steady on the image plane, ensuring clear, crisp images, even in dim light. With a Ring-type USM, inner focusing and new AF algorithms, this lens achieves autofocus quickly and quietly, and with full-time mechanical manual focusing, manually adjusting the focus is possible even in AF mode.

The lens features a large circular aperture that produces a shallow depth of field, creating background blur that draws special attention to the photographic subject. The lens construction, meanwhile, includes UD and aspherical elements that deliver impressive image quality throughout the entire zoom range. And thanks to the Image Stabilizer lens groups--which shift to compensate for camera shake--the image appears crisp and clear on the image plane, eve in dim light.

It has a large maximum aperture which, combined with higher shutter speeds, can minimize subject motion blur. Shallow depth-of-field separation of a subject from its background is much easier to achieve and the f2.8 maximum aperture allows a bright finder and extremely precise focusing with f2.8 compatible AF sensors. The internal stabilization has a sharpness benefit equivalent to a three-stop faster shutter speed, making this lens outstanding in low-light situations. Smaller and lighter than lenses of similar specifications, the EF-S 17-55 mm f2.8 IS USM lens has a 35mm equivalent focal length of 27-88mm and is compatible only with the EOS 30D, EOS 20D, EOS Digital Rebel XT, and EOS Digital Rebel SLRs.

The 15-inch PowerBook G4 comes         with all the refinements and esthetic touches that make it the most coveted         full-featured notebook computer on the planet: 1.1 inch thick, 5.7 pounds,         AirPort Extreme, aluminum design, an elegantly engineered slot-loading         4x-speed SuperDrive and a 4.5-hour battery. On the inside, faster PowerPC         G4 processors, powerful graphics capabilities, up to 2 GB of RAM and the         world's most advanced operating system combine to deliver off-the-charts         performance. <strong>Speed-optimized Architecture</strong><br>         Inside the 15-inch PowerBook G4 is a screamingly fast 1.33 GHz PowerPC         G4 processor with Velocity Engine. Advanced processor design and memory         architecture are among several core advantages that enable the PowerBook         G4 to pack such a tremendous wallop. <strong>Exremely Fast Wireless</strong><br>         Every 15-inch PowerBook comes standard with AirPort Extreme built right         in, so you're ready for 54 Mbps wireless networking out of the box.         And with thousands of wireless-enabled &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in hotels,         airport lounges, coffee shops and bookstores around the world, you can         get online from practically anywhere. What's more, you can use your         PowerBook G4, AirPort Extreme and Rendezvous (which seamlessly recognizes         and links computers and digital devices to each other) to create your         own secure wireless network. <strong>Wireless Internet Everywhere</strong><br>         AirPort Extreme uses radio waves to communicate. This works to your advantage:         Unlike infrared signals, which require an unobstructed line of sight between         the remote unit and the base station, radio waves can pass through solid         objects from up to 150 feet away. Which means that you can take your PowerBook         G4 into different rooms or onto different floors of a building and still         maintain your active network connection -- and surf the Internet         through walls. <strong>4x SuperDrive</strong><br>         Your PowerBook G4 with SuperDrive (DVD-R/CD-RW) comes loaded with iDVD software. Use it to burn DVDs that can be played in most consumer DVD players. You can also use iTunes to burn your own CDs, or the Disc Burner feature in Mac OS X to burn data CDs. The SuperDrive reads DVD titles at 8x and writes to 4.7GB DVD-R discs at 4x speed.<br> <strong>Sizzling         Graphics Processor</strong><br>         The 15-inch PowerBook G4 comes turbocharged with the new ATI Mobility         Radeon 9700 graphics processor with 64MB of DDR SDRAM. The Mobility Radeon         9700 features a number of cutting-edge graphics technologies, including         programmable pixel and vertex shading for lighting and shadow effects.         It dramatically enhances all aspects of your visual experience in every         application, perfect for photorealistic 3D games and cinematic-quality         video. <strong>Fast FireWire 800 and USB 2.0</strong><br>         The PowerBook G4 features FireWire, for connecting external hard drives         and DV cameras, and USB, for connecting graphics tablets, digital cameras,         printers and scanners. With more than 30 times the bandwidth of the popular         USB 1.0 peripheral standard, FireWire 400 has become the gold standard         for high-speed data transfer. And Apple ups the ante, effectively doubling         data throughput, with FireWire 800. The new 15-inch PowerBook G4 has two         FireWire ports -- one for the hundreds of FireWire 400 peripherals         already available and the other for the coming generation of FireWire         800 peripherals. In addition, the PowerBook G4 offers the fastest connection         to USB peripherals with two 480 Mbps USB 2.0 ports. <strong><br>         The Bluetooth Connection<br>         </strong>In addition to AirPort Extreme, you'll also find Bluetooth         built into the new 15-inch PowerBook G4. Bluetooth lets you connect digital         devices wirelessly. For example, you can use iSync, which comes bundled         with all PowerBook G4 configurations, to synchronize your personal information         among various Bluetooth-enabled devices, such as your PowerBook, mobile         phone and Palm OS-based handheld. And Bluetooth lets you take advantage         of GPRS connectivity to check your email from anywhere -- a benefit         that comes in handy on those occasions when an 802.11 wireless hot spot         isn't available."	0

As a matter of fact, we invented the category. Over these years we've seen our cases used for some fairly crazy activities...and important ones too. Pelican Cases have been thrown out of helicopters in Iraq, floated through frigid fjords in Norway and rolled over by SUVs in Tanzania. With only a few scratches to show on the outside, contents inside are left unscathed. These are minor details for major bragging rights. And that is really what it's all about. Getting your gear from point A to point B in the condition it's meant to be in: intact and functional. Because it might contain a large format camera that will shoot next month's magazine cover or a heart defibrillator that could save a person's life, you can't put a price on it.   The secret is the tongue and groove fit with a polymer o-ring acting as a waterproof seal. Automatic Pressure Equalization Valve releases built-up air pressure while keeping water molecules out, resulting in a watertight case that is even easier to open. Stainless steel ball bearing wheels last longer and ride smoother. The nylon hub adjacent to the stainless steel is made to resist heat. The result is less wear and tear on the polyurethane wheel. Stainless steel hasp protectors are a Pelican exclusive. The Double-Throw latches are smarter and easier to open: it's the classic "C" clamp design with a secondary movement that works like a pry bar to start the release and offers plenty of leverage to open with a light pull. Custom engraved nameplates are available for a nominal fee. Stainless steel reinforced padlock protectors provide added strength and extra security against cutting and theft.

Crane FM Reflect Antenna" COL feature VAL "Quick and easy way to improve FM reception Works well with HD Radios 8-foot feed line Indoor Use" COL description VAL "Our best indoor FM Antenna that also works wonders with HD Radio.  A quick and easy way to improve the FM reception of your portable radio or stereo receiver is with an affordable FM Reflect Antenna. The FM Reflect can be bent and shaped to get the best reception from the circular polarization now used by many FM stations. If you've made the leap to HD radio, the FM Reflect is also one of the few antennas that tested well with the new digital signal.  Compared to other indoor FM antennas, the FM Reflect achieves a high signal-to-noise ratio and is less susceptible to interference from surrounding objects and people. The dipole design is more powerful than a standard dipole antenna, and delivers maximum gain across the entire FM broadcast band. Unlike ordinary dipoles, with the FM Reflect Antenna there is no fall off near the end of the FM band. In other words, this is a good FM antenna. National Public Radio Labs has performed some HD Radio reception tests using the FM Reflect and other FM antennas  Size: 54" all-copper element with an 8-foot feed line. Weight: 8.5 oz.

COL title VAL "Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras - White Box (New)" COL feature VAL "Compact, lightweight G-type fast 2.9x telephoto zoom with Vibration Reduction VR operation offers the equivalent of using a shutter speed 3 stops (eight times) faster Holds fast and constant f2.8 maximum aperture through the entire focal range Built-in Single Wave Motor for ultra-fast, ultra-quiet AF operation Five ED glass elements for higher optical performance" COL description VAL "B00009MDBQ Lens-making is an art--Nikon artisans craft Nikkor optics from the finest materials, taking pride in adding their intellect and technique to bring the world's finest lenses to life. They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the "glass" that makes the world's greatest pictures. AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 70-200mm f2.8G IF-ED AF-S VR is a compact, lightweight G-type fast telephoto zoom with Vibration Reduction. VR operation offers the equivalent of using a shutter speed three stops (eight times) faster. In addition, active vibration mode selection is possible, for use in an active situation such as in a car, boat, or plane. VR On/Off mode available. The lens holds a fast and constant f2.8 maximum aperture through the entire focal range. The built-in Single Wave Motor provides ultra-fast, ultra-quiet AF operation. Five ED glass elements offer higher optical performance, and is protected by a dust and waterproof rubber sealing mount. Internal-focusing design smooths focusing and has great body balance, and the filter attachment does not rotate with focusing. It also features an M/A mode that enables instant switching from autofocus to manual with virtually no lag time even during AF servo operation, no power consumption during manual focus operation, rounded diaphragm (9 blades) for natural blur, and focuses as close as 4.9 feet in autofocus and 4.6 feet in manual focus. High-performance Nikon Super Integrated Coating offers superior color reproduction and minimizes ghost and flare. Detachable tripod mounting collar provided. The new G design enables apertures to be selected from select Nikon AF SLR camera bodies, incorporating distance information for flash and ambient light exposure processes. Fully compatible with Nikon TC-14E II, TC-17E II, and TC-20E II teleconverters and D1X, D2H, D1H, D100, D70, F6, F5, F100, N80, N75, and N65 cameras. <B>ED glass: An essential element of Nikkor telephoto lenses</b><br> Nikon developed ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass to enable the production of lenses that offer superior sharpness and color correction by minimizing chromatic aberration. Put simply, chromatic aberration is a type of image and color dispersion that occurs when light rays of varying wavelengths pass through optical glass. In the past, correcting this problem for telephoto lenses required special optical elements that offer anomalous dispersion characteristics--specifically calcium fluoride crystals. However, fluorite easily cracks and is sensitive to temperature changes that can adversely affect focusing by altering the lens' refractive index. So Nikon designers and engineers put their heads together and came up with ED glass, which offers all the benefits and none of the drawbacks of calcium fluorite-based glass. With this innovation, Nikon developed several types of ED glass suitable for various lenses. They deliver stunning sharpness and contrast even at their largest apertures. In this way, Nikkor's ED-series lenses exemplify Nikon's preeminence in lens innovation and performance. <B>Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performance</b><br> To enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry. <B>Internal Focusing</b><br> Imagine being able to focus a lens without it changing in size. Nikon's IF technology enables just that. All internal optical movement is limited to the interior of the non-extending lens barrel. This allows for a more compact, lightweight construction as well as a closer focusing distance. In addition, a smaller and lighter focusing lens group is employed to ensure faster focusing. The IF system is featured in most Nikkor telephoto and selected Nikkor zoom lenses. <B>Distance information</b><br> D-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70. Flash control; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70 cameras. <B>G-type Nikkor lens</b><br> The G-type Nikkor has no aperture ring; aperture should be selected from camera body. <B>Silent Wave Motor</b><br> Nikon's AF-S technology is yet another reason professional photographers like Nikkor telephoto lenses. AF-S Nikkors feature Nikon's SWM which converts "traveling waves" into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that's extremely accurate and super quiet. <B>M/A mode</b><br> AF-S Nikkors feature Nikon's exclusive M/A mode, that allows switching from autofocus to manual operation with virtually no time lag--even during AF servo operation and regardless of AF mode in use. <B>Vibration Reduction (VR)</b><br> This innovative VR system minimizes image blur caused by camera shake, and offers the equivalent of shooting at a shutter speed three stops (eight times) faster. It allows handheld shooting at dusk, at night, and even in poorly lit interiors. The lens' VR system also detects automatically when the photographer pans--no special mode is required. VR operation works with the Nikon F6, F5, F100, F80, F75, F65, D2-series, D1-series, D100, D70-series, and D50 cameras. <B>What's in the Box:</b><br> Lens, 77mm snap-on front lens cap, rear lens cap LF-1, bayonet hood HB-29, soft pouch CL-M2."

This results in sharper images with less motion blur and reduced need to use flash in dimly lit conditions so you can easily capture the atmosphere of a low light environment.The 50mm focal length allows you to fill the frame with your subject from a comfortable distance making it a great lens for portraits. A similar perspective to the human eye and its compact size make the EF 50mm f/1.8 STM a great everyday lens to always carry with your EOS camera.The near-silent STM (Stepping Motor) technology focuses extremely quickly when shooting photos, so you can react suddenly to capture fleeting moments. Creating high quality movies is easier with STM as it delivers steady and quiet continuous focusing, so your movies are smooth, and soundtracks only capture the surrounding sounds and not the noise of a focusing motor.The EF 50mm f/1.8 STM replaces the popular EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens which was affectionately known for giving outstanding picture quality at an affordable price.

With an 80mm effective focal-length on APS-C cameras, 50mm on full-frame cameras, it's an excellent prime lens for portraits, action, even nighttime photography. Its bright maximum aperture of f/1.8 helps it not only to excel in low light, but also to capture gorgeous, sharp images and movies with beautiful background blur thanks to its circular 7-blade design. An updated lens arrangement with new lens coatings helps render images with excellent color balance, plus minimized ghosting and flare. Performance is brilliant, with a stepping motor (gear-type STM) to deliver near silent, continuous Movie Servo AF for movies plus speedy, smooth AF for stills. A redesigned exterior with improved focus ring placement makes manual focus adjustments a breeze. Canon's most compact 50mm lens, the EF 50mm f/1.8 STM has a rugged metal mount, plus an improved minimum focusing distance of 1.15 ft. (0.35m) and a maximum magnification of 0.21x.

With a fast and constant f2.8 maximum aperture through the entire focal range, ED glass elements provide high-resolution and high-contrast image even at maximum aperture. The rotating zoom ring provides precise zoom operation. <B>ED glass: An essential element of Nikkor telephoto lenses</b><br> Nikon developed ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass to enable the production of lenses that offer superior sharpness and color correction by minimizing chromatic aberration. Put simply, chromatic aberration is a type of image and color dispersion that occurs when light rays of varying wavelengths pass through optical glass. In the past, correcting this problem for telephoto lenses required special optical elements that offer anomalous dispersion characteristics--specifically calcium fluoride crystals. However, fluorite easily cracks and is sensitive to temperature changes that can adversely affect focusing by altering the lens' refractive index. So Nikon designers and engineers put their heads together and came up with ED glass, which offers all the benefits and none of the drawbacks of calcium fluorite-based glass. With this innovation, Nikon developed several types of ED glass suitable for various lenses. They deliver stunning sharpness and contrast even at their largest apertures. In this way, Nikkor's ED-series lenses exemplify Nikon's preeminence in lens innovation and performance. <B>Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performance</b><br> To enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry. <B>Distance information</b><br> D-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100 and D70s/D70.

So you can enjoy peace of mind using your laptop or netbook in close quarters or high traffic areas. Plus, easy-on, easy-off 3M&trade; Privacy Filters are the convenient way to create a barrier between your fragile LCD screen and inevitable scuffs and scratches. And like the stylish new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U0NDEI ">3M&trade; GOLD Privacy Filters</a>, they don&rsquo;t rely on blurring or distorting images to guard your privacy. So they go a long way in protecting your eyes. Simply size up your screen and scroll the model list above. Then confidently take your digital life with you, wherever life takes you. Even better, all 3M Privacy Filters are backed by a one-year warranty. To ensure proper fit, <strong>measure the viewable height and width</strong> of your laptop screen. (Do not include the screen frame in your measurement.) Then, choose the filter size that matches your exact measurements, or slightly smaller. Even if you have a pretty good idea what screen size and aspect ratio your laptop or netbook boasts, it&rsquo;s best to pull out the ruler. By ordering the 3M&trade; Privacy Filter that is a perfect fit for your widescreen or standard laptop or netbook, you&rsquo;ll save time and money by avoiding the hassle of returns and exchanges. See the measuring instructions diagram to determine your perfect fit from the model list above. Whether it&rsquo;s staying compliant for work or keeping family photos to yourself, privacy is central to everything you do. 3M&trade; Privacy Filters create a 30-degree cone of vision so on-screen data is visible only to those directly in front of your screen. Fear no train commute, plane seat, park bench, cubicle farm or coffee house. No matter where you are or what digital device you have, 3M&trade; Privacy Filters prevent others from crowding your personal space or perusing your digital life. Your laptop or netbook screen is an open window to your personal and business affairs. But what about your <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002H3NSFC">mobile device</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015YOVPU">desktop</a>? Whether you login at work or home, in a bustling coffee shop or busy airport, 3M Privacy Filters and Films are designed to deliver peace of mind in any setting. How do 3M&trade; Privacy Filters protect your on-screen information while making it privy to your eyes only? Patented 3M&trade; Advanced Light Control Film (ALCF) technology contains closely spaced black microlouvers positioned to 1-degree precision, with over a dozen louvers per millimeter evenly distributed across the screen. It&rsquo;s a mini Venetian blind with no strings attached. Easy-on, easy-off attachment system makes 3M&trade; Privacy Filters the perfect fit for laptop and netbook users on the go.

The telescope side of the T-Ring has threads that will accept a variety of camera adapters, including the Celestron T-Adapter or Tele-Extender. The adapter you choose depends on the type of photography you wish to do. You can take pictures of terrestrial and/or celestial scenes by using a simple T-Adapter to turn your telescope or spotting scope into a large telephoto lens. The #93633-A T-Adapter is the best choice if you own a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope with standard rear cell threads. If you have a refractor, the Universal T-Adapter (#93625), with its 1-1/4 barrel insert, is available. There are also special T-Adapters for the EdgeHD optical system: one for the 8-inch EdgeHD (#93644) and one for the 9.25, 11, and 14-inch EdgeHD (#93646). Prime focus photography is popular for short exposure images of terrestrial objects as well as celestial objects like the Moon. If you need extra magnification beyond that which your Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope provides, a Tele-Extender (#93643) will allow you to insert an eyepiece inside the barrel before attaching it to the telescope. A Tele-Extender is used most often for high power images of the Moon and the planets."	1

Perfect for Mac OS X users, the side buttons are pre-programmed to activate Expos&eacute;, so you can view all your windows with a squeeze. Of course, you can also customize Mighty Mouse to open whatever you choose--Spotlight, Dashboard or any application when you have Mac OS X v10.4.6 or later. <b>The Button That Wasn&rsquo;t</b></br>Alas the fate of the one-button mouse in today&rsquo;s multibutton world.

Thanks to a smooth top shell with touch-sensitive technology beneath, Mighty Mouse allows you to right click without a right button. Capacitive sensors under Mighty Mouse&rsquo;s seamless top shell detect where your fingers are and predict your clicking intentions, so you don&rsquo;t need two buttons &mdash; just two fingers. Click on the left side to use Mighty Mouse in its simplest, single-button form. Click on the right to access contextual menus within applications and edit, copy, label or download from your mouse. It&rsquo;s simple sleight of hand. <table align="left" cellpadding="10" width="350"> <tbody><tr> <td> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/keyfeatures.gif" align="top" border="0"><br><small><i><b>The Mighty Mouse offers plenty of functionality.</b></i> <small></small></small></td></tr></tbody></table> <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="100"> <tbody><tr> <td> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/designbatteries20060718.jpg" align="top" border="0"></a><br><br><small><i><b>The mouse works with 1 or 2 AA batteries.</a></b></i></small></td></tr> </tbody></table> <b>More Mouse, Less Mess</b><br>Perfectly portable, the wireless Mighty Mouse goes anywhere you do and banishes clutter in its wake. A secure Bluetooth connection keeps you in control from up to 30 feet, and you can forget lugging around a bulky charging dock: the wireless Mighty Mouse works with one or two AA batteries. Two last longer, but one works just as well and packs ultralight. <b>A Mac and Mouse Game</b><br>Because Apple engineers designed Mighty Mouse to work in perfect harmony with the operating system, you get the full Mac OS X experience from the comfort of your mouse. Take that Scroll Ball button, for instance. Pre-programmed to launch Dashboard, it gives you access to a world of information in a single click. Mighty Mouse&rsquo;s side buttons show you all your open windows in Expos&eacute; with a squeeze. Of course, you can program both of these buttons--along with Mighty Mouse&rsquo;s right- and left-click functions--to launch Dashboard, Expos&eacute;, Spotlight, Application Switcher or any application you choose. Mac OS X gives you the capability, thanks to an intuitive System Preference pane. <b>Switch Users, Not Mice</b><br>Once you set your Mighty Mouse preferences, your Mac will remember them, even if you share your computer with others. Each account on your Mac has its own preferences, so everyone can use Mighty Mouse differently. Program Mighty Mouse as a simple, single-button mouse for a youngster. Set buttons to launch user-specific apps. Limit application access for children by pre-programming Mighty Mouse and locking System Preferences using parental controls. No matter how they work or play, Mighty Mouse makes everybody happy--all from one Mac. <b>X-Mouse</b><br> Mighty Mouse helps you make the most of Mac OS X. Pre-configured to launch Dashboard from the Scroll Ball button and Expos&eacute; from the side squeeze buttons, Mighty Mouse gives you lots of other options: <ul> <li>Program the Scroll Ball button to launch Application Switcher, then move from one task to another with a scroll. <li>Set any button to start a new Spotlight search and find what you&rsquo;re looking for, fast. <li>Change the side buttons from displaying all windows in Expos&eacute; to displaying only the windows in the current application. <li>Launch any application you choose from any button on Mighty Mouse: Just select "other" from the button drop-down menu and browse for applications in the Finder. <li>Designate either top-shell button as your primary--the perfect solution for southpaws. <li>Activate screen zoom with the keyboard and Scroll Ball. </ul> <b>What's in the Box:</b><br> Apple Bluetooth Wireless Mighty Mouse, 2 AA batteries, software CD, instructions."

COL title VAL "Tamron Auto Focus 2x Teleconverter for Nikon Mount Lenses (Model 230FFN)" COL feature VAL "Increases focal length from same camera position by 2x Powerful and creative options for your telephoto photography Fits easily between lens and camera body. Includes carry case Not designed for use with Digital SLRS. In some cases, they may only work manually." COL description VAL "It is natural for the image quality to deteriorate when using a teleconverter since the lens becomes darker due to aperture loss: one F-stop (with 1.4X) or two F-stop (with 2X). Depending on the shooting conditions, the Auto Focus may hunt. In that case, please use MF (manual) mode. This teleconverter is not designed for digital use. We do not guarantee its performance when used on Digital SLR cameras. When using the teleconveter, it maybe difficult to achieve focus using AF because the depth of field becomes shallow. If this occurs, focus manually. If used with a variable F-number zoom lens (e.g. 2.8-3.5), AF may not operate at the telephoto side. If this occurs, focus manually. A Teleconverter is a great way to extend the focal length of your lens. This converter will extend the focal length of your lens by 2x giving more magnification."

Chromatic aberration  reduces the sharpness of an image, but glass with an extremely low  dispersion index, has less of a tendency to separate (defract) a ray of  light into a rainbow of colors. This characteristic allows the lens  designer to effectively compensate for chromatic aberration at the  center of the field (on axis), a particular problem at long focal  lengths (the telephoto end of the zoom range), and for lateral chromatic  aberration (towards the edges of the field) that often occurs at short  focal lengths (the wide-angle end of the zoom range.)" <br /> <strong></strong>"	1

As a matter of fact, we invented the category. Over these years we've seen our cases used for some fairly crazy activities...and important ones too. Pelican Cases have been thrown out of helicopters in Iraq, floated through frigid fjords in Norway and rolled over by SUVs in Tanzania. With only a few scratches to show on the outside, contents inside are left unscathed. These are minor details for major bragging rights. And that is really what it's all about. Getting your gear from point A to point B in the condition it's meant to be in: intact and functional. Because it might contain a large format camera that will shoot next month's magazine cover or a heart defibrillator that could save a person's life, you can't put a price on it. Pelican Cases are made with a proprietary combination of homo co-polymers, using an open cell core and solid wall construction, which is stronger and lighter than a solid core wall. Stainless steel pins are used in hinges and handles. Stainless steel hasp protectors are a Pelican exclusive. The Double-Throw latches are smarter and easier to open: it's the classic "C" clamp design with a secondary movement that works like a pry bar to start the release and offers plenty of leverage to open with a light pull. The secret is the tongue and groove fit with a polymer o-ring acting as a waterproof seal. Custom engraved nameplates are available for a nominal fee. Automatic Pressure Equalization Valve releases built-up air pressure while keeping water molecules out, resulting in a watertight case that is even easier to open. Stainless steel reinforced padlock protectors provide added strength and extra security against cutting and theft. Stainless steel ball bearing wheels last longer and ride smoother. The nylon hub adjacent to the stainless steel is made to resist heat. The result is less wear and tear on the polyurethane wheel."	1

As a matter of fact, we invented the category. Over these years we've seen our cases used for some fairly crazy activities...and important ones too. Pelican Cases have been thrown out of helicopters in Iraq, floated through frigid fjords in Norway and rolled over by SUVs in Tanzania. With only a few scratches to show on the outside, contents inside are left unscathed. These are minor details for major bragging rights. And that is really what it's all about. Getting your gear from point A to point B in the condition it's meant to be in: intact and functional. Because it might contain a large format camera that will shoot next month's magazine cover or a heart defibrillator that could save a person's life, you can't put a price on it. Pelican Cases are made with a proprietary combination of homo co-polymers, using an open cell core and solid wall construction, which is stronger and lighter than a solid core wall. Stainless steel pins are used in hinges and handles. Stainless steel hasp protectors are a Pelican exclusive. The Double-Throw latches are smarter and easier to open: it's the classic "C" clamp design with a secondary movement that works like a pry bar to start the release and offers plenty of leverage to open with a light pull. The secret is the tongue and groove fit with a polymer o-ring acting as a waterproof seal. Custom engraved nameplates are available for a nominal fee. Automatic Pressure Equalization Valve releases built-up air pressure while keeping water molecules out, resulting in a watertight case that is even easier to open. Stainless steel reinforced padlock protectors provide added strength and extra security against cutting and theft. Stainless steel ball bearing wheels last longer and ride smoother. The nylon hub adjacent to the stainless steel is made to resist heat. The result is less wear and tear on the polyurethane wheel."	1

COL title VAL "Nightvision Car Dash DVR Two Cam Vehicle Video Recorder for Taxi Cabs" COL feature VAL "Automatic, Dependable Operation: The DuoCam plugs into the cigarette lighter and automatically records whenever its plugged in. Power and recording buttons can override automatic operation if you choose. Should the plug become disconnected, battery power takes over, providing two hours of operation on a full charge. Should you run out of power completely, the DuoCam automatically saves recorded files before shutting down. High-quality Video and Stills: The dual 1,280x480 video cameras record at a user-selected 10, 20, or 30 frames per second, providing detailed images at every setting. A built-in microphone records audio and a five-megapixel still camera captures JPEG images. Documentation of all video is complete with a time and date water stamp on the video footage. Backing You Up: In the event of an accident, DuoCam footage will be invaluable. Commercial drivers can limit their liability and possibly save on insurance premiums if video evidence shows they arent at fault. Private vehicle owners take the same risks, and DuoCam footage could potentially prevent years of raised premiums and out-of-pocket costs. With DuoCams unbiased testimony, the truth prevails in circumstances that used to rely on hearsay and conjecture. Night Vision Capability: Both cameras feature infrared recording technology. Invisible LED lamps provide a light source for night recording, never distracting you, so your focus stays on the road. MicroSD and USB 2.0 Compatible: Save your video files in AVI format on 2 - 32 GB capacity MicroSD cards, and transfer them to a computer via either USB 2.0 connection or a MicroSD Card reader."

Panasonic's high-tech DIGA series DMR-ES10S DVD recorder has everything you need to archive your old VHS and camcorder tapes while taking over any lingering TV-related duties from your VCR and serving as a home-theater-caliber DVD player to boot. The unit records to your choice of DVD-RAM, DVD-R, DVD+R, or rewritable DVD-RW. For playback, it'll handle those formats in addition to DVD+RW, DVD-Audio (high-resolution 2-channel only), video CD, MP3 CD, and recordable CDs brimming with your cherished JPEG digital photos. DVD-Audio media offer super high-fidelity (192 kHz/24-bit) sound and provides unique bonus materials not available on regular audio CDs.<P> The DMR-ES10S's virtual Multi-Encode System enables LP mode recording with the same 500 lines of horizontal resolution as the deck uses to encode in the higher-quality SP and XP modes. This is twice the 250 lines of resolution used in conventional Long Play recording. Now you can store 4 hours of full-resolution program material on a standard 4.7 GB recordable DVD rather than merely 2 hours.<P> Panasonic's Time Slip feature lets you use your DVD recorder like a digital video recorder, viewing the recorded portion of an ongoing program from the beginning, while still recording the program in progress. With Chasing Playback, you can view the recorded portion of a live program, from the beginning, while continuing to record that program until its completion. Simultaneous record and play lets you view a previously recorded program on either a DVD-RAM disc or the hard disk drive while recording a different program.<P> The DMR-ES10S uses a 12-bit video analog-to-digital converter to provide 4 times the number of possible color gradation (shades) offered by 10-bit converters. This preserves your source images with more detail, more definition, and more beauty. Other enhancements include Panasonic's Real-Time Variable Bit Rate Control, integrated noise reduction (NR), and Visibility Modulation technology.<P> The DMR-ES10S is also a progressive-scan DVD <i>player</i> for use with both standard- and high-definition or HD-ready TVs. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.<P> Panasonic's Direct Navigator simplifies the process of previewing recorded programs, letting you access recorded material from an onscreen menu that lists recording dates, times, channels, and titles.

(Note that your TV must have an HDMI connection; HDMI cable not included.) Choose from a full spectrum of recordable DVD media--write-once DVD+R and DVD-R discs or rewritable DVD-RW/+RW and DVD-RAM discs.

You can also view individual images and photo slideshows using the integrated Secure Digital (SD) memory card slot (compatible with JPEG and TIFF file formats). Panasonic's Time Slip function consists of two features designed to give you added flexibility and control when making DVD recordings: Chasing Playback and Simultaneous Record &amp; Play. With Chasing Playback, you don't have to wait for an entire program to be recorded before watching it from beginning to end. This feature allows you to watch a program that's currently being recorded from any point that's already been recorded--while continuing to record the live program in progress. Simultaneous Record &amp; Play allows you to record a program onto a disc while simultaneously watching any other program that's previously been recorded on the same disc. You can set your recorder to one of five different recording speeds, each varying in recording quality and length. EP mode yields the most recording time, LP &amp; SP modes provide less recording time with higher quality recording, and XP mode gives you the highest quality recording. There's also the FR (Flexible Recording) mode that lets you record with the best picture quality possible for the recording time and remaining space on the disc. The Direct Navigator feature makes it easy to find a previously recorded program on a disc. A list of recording dates, times, channels and (user-entered) titles are shown on screen. With the Playlist Playback function, you can perform simple non-linear video editing using, such as rearranging the order of scenes, skipping over unwanted scenes, or copying selections Jump directly to any spot on a disc and begin playback or recording right away with the Rapid Random Access function when using DVD-RAM discs. Even if there is no sequential area of empty space available, this DVD recorder can record data on available space throughout the rest of the disc. You will also avoid searching for a blank spot to start recording, or accidentally recording over desired material. Enjoy a great picture on you flat screen LCD or plasma HDTV using the component video output, and immersive surround sound via the optical digital audio output for Dolby Digital and DTS home theater effects.

It provides up to a 5 GB per second bandwidth for transmitting pure digital video and audio signals with no degradation in the transfer. It can carry up to eight discrete audio channels, making it compatible with 7.1-channel surround sound systems. Signals are encrypted with HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) to prevent recording. HDMI is fully backward-compatible with most DVI connections . <i>Component video</i> (also called Y/Pb/Pr) features a three-jack video input, which provides separate connections for luminance (Y), blue color difference (PB) and red color difference (PR). This results in increased bandwidth for color information, resulting in a more accurate picture with clearer color reproduction and less bleeding than you would get with S-Video or composite (RCA yellow video plug) connections. You will need a separate RCA left/right audio cable for sound. <i>High Definition Formats:</i> The most common high-def (HD) video format is 720p, which displays video at 720 vertical by 1280 horizontal pixels. The "p" denotes that it is progressive scan, meaning that all video lines are filled at the same time. The 1080i format displays video at 1080 vertical by 1920 horizontal pixels, and the "i" means that it is interlaced (the old-school way of presenting video where the screen scans the odd-numbered video lines first, then the even-numbered lines). The 1080p format has the same pixel resolution as 1080i, but it is a progressive scan format and thus has a constant vertical resolution of 1080 lines. <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD recorder/player, remote control (with batteries), AV cable, RF cable, power cord, one DVD-RAM disc, printed operating instructions"	1

As a matter of fact, we invented the category. Over these years we've seen our cases used for some fairly crazy activities...and important ones too. Pelican Cases have been thrown out of helicopters in Iraq, floated through frigid fjords in Norway and rolled over by SUVs in Tanzania. With only a few scratches to show on the outside, contents inside are left unscathed. These are minor details for major bragging rights. And that is really what it's all about. Getting your gear from point A to point B in the condition it's meant to be in: intact and functional. Because it might contain a large format camera that will shoot next month's magazine cover or a heart defibrillator that could save a person's life, you can't put a price on it. Pelican Cases are made with a proprietary combination of homo co-polymers, using an open cell core and solid wall construction, which is stronger and lighter than a solid core wall. Stainless steel pins are used in hinges and handles. Stainless steel hasp protectors are a Pelican exclusive. The Double-Throw latches are smarter and easier to open: it's the classic "C" clamp design with a secondary movement that works like a pry bar to start the release and offers plenty of leverage to open with a light pull. The secret is the tongue and groove fit with a polymer o-ring acting as a waterproof seal. Custom engraved nameplates are available for a nominal fee. Automatic Pressure Equalization Valve releases built-up air pressure while keeping water molecules out, resulting in a watertight case that is even easier to open. Stainless steel reinforced padlock protectors provide added strength and extra security against cutting and theft. Stainless steel ball bearing wheels last longer and ride smoother. The nylon hub adjacent to the stainless steel is made to resist heat. The result is less wear and tear on the polyurethane wheel."	1

This red dot finder keeps the sky right-side up, matching what you see with your unaided eyes The adjustable red dot is bright enough to see day or night Attaches to just about any telescope thanks to the small footprint, even works great with astronomical binoculars and spotting scopes Includes mounting base and a long-lasting CR2032 3V battery" COL description VAL "The Celestron Star Pointer Finderscope is the way to go if you want the easiest way possible to locate an object and center it in your eyepiece. A red dot finder, unlike an optical finder, has 1x magnification, displays a super wide field of view, and keeps the sky right side up and left-to-right correct, matching what you see with your unaided eyes. An LED creates a red dot, superimposed on a viewing screen, so you simply point the Star Pointer to the area or object you wish to observe, look through your eyepiece, and if properly aligned, the area in and around place you pointed the red dot will be centered in the field of view. If you like the idea of having some magnification, try installing both a red dot and optical finder on your telescope. Schmidt-Cassegrain and EdgeHD telescopes have multiple mounting bracket holes so you can get the best of both worlds. Just make sure to align both of them correctly, and youll get the best use out of each of your finders. How to Align the Star Pointer Finderscope The first time you use your finder, you need to align it. This one-time setup procedure should be done during the day. Take the telescope outside and find an easily recognizable object, such as a streetlight, car license plate, or tall tree. The object should be as far away as possible, but at least a quarter mile away. Move the telescope left and right or up and down so that it is roughly pointing at the object. Look through the telescope using your low power eyepiece and move the telescope until the object you chose lies in the center of the view. Once the object is centered in your eyepiece, turn on the red dot. With your head positioned about a foot behind the finder, look through the round lens of the finder and locate the red dot. Without moving the telescope, use the two adjustment knobs located on the side and underneath the finder. One controls the left-right motion of the dot. The other controls the up-down motion of the dot. Adjust both of these until the red dot appears over the same object you are observing in the eyepiece. Your finder is now aligned and should not require realignment unless it is bumped or dropped. You can even take the finder off the telescope and reattach it while preserving alignment."	1

As a matter of fact, we invented the category. Over these years we've seen our cases used for some fairly crazy activities...and important ones too. Pelican Cases have been thrown out of helicopters in Iraq, floated through frigid fjords in Norway and rolled over by SUVs in Tanzania. With only a few scratches to show on the outside, contents inside are left unscathed. These are minor details for major bragging rights. And that is really what it's all about. Getting your gear from point A to point B in the condition it's meant to be in: intact and functional. Because it might contain a large format camera that will shoot next month's magazine cover or a heart defibrillator that could save a person's life, you can't put a price on it.   The secret is the tongue and groove fit with a polymer o-ring acting as a waterproof seal. Automatic Pressure Equalization Valve releases built-up air pressure while keeping water molecules out, resulting in a watertight case that is even easier to open. Stainless steel ball bearing wheels last longer and ride smoother. The nylon hub adjacent to the stainless steel is made to resist heat. The result is less wear and tear on the polyurethane wheel. Stainless steel hasp protectors are a Pelican exclusive. The Double-Throw latches are smarter and easier to open: it's the classic "C" clamp design with a secondary movement that works like a pry bar to start the release and offers plenty of leverage to open with a light pull. Custom engraved nameplates are available for a nominal fee. Stainless steel reinforced padlock protectors provide added strength and extra security against cutting and theft. "	1

A woven glass fiber midrange speaker works together with a cloth dome tweeter to create a high-quality sound delivery system.

Each speaker generates a powerful, robust sound from 28 watts of total power. A 50 Hz to 20 kHz frequency response and 80 dB signal-to-noise ratio mean that these speakers cover the sound spectrum with efficiency, producing clear, precise highs, mids, and lows. <b>Convenient Control and Expandability</b><br> Dial in the perfect sound to match your needs with the front-mounted bass, treble, and volume controls. A front auxiliary input allows you to plug in your digital music device or CD player, making it easy to listen to your digital music library. And a headphone jack lets you enjoy music and movies without disturbing those around you.

The D300 features a new 51-point autofocus system with Nikon's 3D Focus Tracking feature and two new LiveView shooting modes that allow users to frame a photograph using the camera's high-resolution LCD monitor. The D300 shares a similar Scene Recognition System as is found in the D3; it promises to greatly enhance the accuracy of autofocus, autoexposure, and auto white balance by recognizing the subject or scene being photographed and applying this information to the calculations for the three functions. </P> <P>The D300 reacts with lightning speed, powering up in a mere 0.13 seconds and shooting with an imperceptible 45-millisecond shutter release lag time. The D300 is capable of shooting at a rapid six frames per second and can go as fast as eight frames per second when using the optional MB-D10 multi-power battery pack. In continuous bursts, the D300 can shoot up to 100 shots at full 12.3-megapixel resolution. (NORMAL-LARGE image setting, using a SanDisk Extreme IV 1GB CompactFlash card.)</P> <P>The D300 incorporates a range of innovative technologies and features that will significantly improve the accuracy, control, and performance photographers can get from their equipment. Its new Scene Recognition System advances the use of Nikon's acclaimed 1,005-segment sensor to recognize colors and light patterns that help the camera determine the subject and the type of scene being photographed before a picture is taken. This information is used to improve the accuracy of autofocus, autoexposure, and auto white balance functions in the D300. For example, the camera can track moving subjects better and by identifying them, it can also automatically select focus points faster and with greater accuracy. It can also analyze highlights and more accurately determine exposure, as well as infer light sources to deliver more accurate white balance detection.</P> <P>The D300 incorporates Nikon's new Multi-CAM 3500DX autofocus module that features an intelligent array of 15 cross-type sensors and 36 horizontal sensors. These sensors can either be used individually or in groups, with the option for Single area AF mode and Dynamic AF modes using groups of either nine, 21, or all 51 focus points. The system also features 3D tracking with automatic focus-point switching that takes advantage of all 51 AF points as it uses color and light information to accurately track the subject. Nikon's new Scene Recognition System and improved focus algorithms also contribute to the impressive performance of the new 51-point AF system. </P> <P>Nikon's new Picture Control System makes it easy for users of all experience levels to select and apply adjustments to how their pictures are rendered and create optimized settings to suit their individual preferences. The same settings produce consistent picture tone, even when using different camera bodies. The Picture Control System offers four basic setting options--Standard, Neutral, Vivid, and Monochrome. These can be directly modified for easy adjustment and customization of image parameters, such as sharpening, tone compensation, brightness, and saturation. Photographers can customize and store up to nine customized options in the D300 and export up to 99 to a CF memory card, enabling photographers to share settings among multiple cameras that feature Picture Control System.</P> <P>Taking a cue from the popularity of Nikon's D-Lighting technology, the D300 features a new Active D-Lighting mode that, when enabled, provides remarkable real-time highlight and shadow correction with optimized image contrast. Active D-Lighting produces broader tone reproduction in both shadows and highlights by controlling highlights and exposure compensation while applying localized tone control technology to achieve a more pleasing level of contrast across the entire image. And because the advantages of Active D-Lighting are applied as images are captured, image editing time can be shortened.</P> <P>The D300's LiveView feature offers two modes for confirming subjects and composition on the new 920,000-dot, high-resolution 3-inch LCD monitor while shooting. The Tripod mode is designed for precise focus and accuracy when the camera is on a stable platform and the subject is not moving. In this mode, the camera focuses on the subject using focal-plane contrast and any point on the LCD screen can be selected as the focus point for the picture. The second mode, called Handheld mode, allows photographers to use the camera's conventional TTL focusing system with all 51-points and 15 cross-type points available. When using this mode, the camera activates focusing immediately when the shutter button is pressed to ensure accurate focus.</P> <P>The D300 also employs a new self-cleaning sensor unit. Four different resonance frequencies vibrate the optical low-pass filter in front of the image sensor to shake particles free and reduce the appearance of dust.</P> <B>Refined Ergonomics and Usability</B><BR> The D300 inherits one of Nikon's most streamlined, functional, and aesthetically pleasing layouts in a digital SLR camera, designed to enable photographers to take pictures with less fatigue, greater accuracy, and comfort. <P>The camera's viewfinder provides virtually 100 percent coverage so pictures can be framed accurately, while an ultra-high definition 920,000 dot VGA LCD screen on the rear of the camera displays images with vivid color and clarity. Its 170-degree wide viewing angle makes it easy to compose shots using the LCD screen in LiveView mode. </P> <P>The D300 features rugged magnesium alloy construction and the camera's shutter mechanism is tested up to 150,000 cycles. The 3.0-inch LCD is strengthened with tempered glass and the D300's rubber gaskets and seals protect vulnerable entry points from dust and moisture.</P> <B>What's in the box</B><BR> Nikon D300 digital SLR body, EN-EL3e rechargeable li-ion battery, MH-18a quick charger, UC-E4 USB cable, EG-D100 video cable, AN-D300 strap, BM-8 LCD monitor cover, body cap, DK-5 eyepiece cap, DK-23 rubber eyecup, Software Suite CD-ROM"	1
