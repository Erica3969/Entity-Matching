By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Best Fitness E1 Elliptical Trainer by Body Solid\" COL feature VAL \"Compact and portable elliptical trainer offers a patented center drive design and low center of gravity Constructed with a powder-coated steel frame Measures 48 by 30 by 66 inches (L x W x H) Moving arms allows for a dual-action, upper and lower body workout Close pedal spacing eliminates hip fatigue; contact heart rate grips allow you to monitor your workout intensity Fifteen-year frame warranty, 10-year motor warranty; 275-pound user capacity\" COL description VAL \"Featuring a comfortable and natural stride, the Best Fitness E1 center drive elliptical trainer offers patented technology that ensures the shape of the ellipse is biomechanically correct.

The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy.

Classic series knives were the first to feature Wusthof PEtec - Precision Edge Technology - for an easily maintained razor-sharp edge that retains its cutting performance twice as long as other knives. The attractive, ergonomic black handle is designed for comfort and control, and is made of a seamless, synthetic material for a hygienic grip. The handle is triple-riveted to the full-length tang for exceptional durability and the full bolster protects fingers from slipping. Cook's knives are indispensable kitchen helpers. They perform a wide variety of cutting chores, from mincing to dicing and slicing. The 5-inch blade of this definitive example provides sufficient heft to allow the knife rather than the cook to do most of the cutting labor; it's modest blade length makes it particularly useful for small chopping jobs, slicing, and cubing. Many people favor a cook's knife of this size because it combines the maneuverability of a paring knife with the strength and weight of a larger cook's knife. Part of the Classic series, the knife represents two centuries of unexcelled W&uuml;sthof craftsmanship. Like other cutlery in the series, it's hand-forged from a single piece of stainless steel for maximum strength; the hand-polished blade is exactingly calibrated to be hard enough to resist dulling yet soft enough to take a keen edge when it's honed or sharpened. Dishwasher-safe and with a traditionally shaped, ergonomically designed handle that is triple-riveted for durability, this knife brings a guaranteed lifetime of low-maintenance cutting to any cook who owns it. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Wusthof Classic 5-Inch Cook's Knife\" COL feature VAL \"5-inch cook's knife for cutting, chopping, slicing, and dicing Precision forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel Full-tang, triple-riveted synthetic handle affords superior strength and balance Washing by hand recommended; made in Germany Measures approximately 11 by 3 by 1 inches; limited lifetime warranty\" COL description VAL \"4582-7/14  Features: -Blade Dimension 5''.-Forged From One Piece Of Specially Tempered High Carbon Steel To Ensure Outstanding Strength.-Extraordinary Sharpness Which Is Easy To Maintain.-Special Alloyed Steel.-Seamless, Hygienic Fit Of Handle.-Triple-Riveted, Full Tang Synthetic Handle.-Dishwasher Safe, But Hand-Washing Recommended.-Lifetime Guarantee.-Made in Solingen, Germany.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9988144096214892}

The nonstick grids prevent crumbling waffles, are easy to clean, and allow for lower-fat grilling, justifying more whipped cream on your waffles, or extra cheese in your sandwich.

Classic three-rivet handles distinguish Pro S from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Pro S handles are heavier and its knives less weight-forward. The steel used in the Pro S line is identical to that of the Five and Four Star lines. High-tech welding of knives this size and larger combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel. While this chef's knife is dishwasher-safe, hand washing is recommended. <I>--Fred Brack</I> <P> <B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/henck-pro-s-block.jpg </td> <td> The J.A.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9959770900642709}

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"JUGS Bulldog White Poly Baseballs - bulk box of 100\" COL feature VAL \"JUGS Bulldog Polyball Practice White Hole Baseballs 100 Total Balls 9 Inch Balls Last 30% Longer Than Other Balls Uniform Holes - White\" COL description VAL \"JUGS Bulldog White Poly Baseball 9-inch Hole Balls.

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM \"tent cities\" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, Eurekas new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition. For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Womens Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian. <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering. \"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9961829502757347}

Grinding fresh whole bean coffee immediately before brewing is the first step to achieving the best tasting coffee at home. Ground coffee interacts with the air around it and, within hours, loses a great deal of flavor and aroma. The longer the ground coffee is exposed to air the more flavor is lost and the rich, full-bodied taste of the coffee cannot be obtained.

The amount of ground coffee varies quite a bit depending on how coarse or fine you grind and whether you use light, dry beans or dark, oily beans.

The inventor, a pet lover and owner of a friendly Yellow Labrador Retriever named \"Bentley\" encountered a problem as do many pet owners today. Bentley was \"teething\" and enjoyed the soft exterior of the backyard water hose. In an effort to protect Bentley and keep from replacing the water hose on a regular basis, the search was on for a for a water hose that was impervious to a dogs bite or \"chewing\". No such hose could be found at the time. This initiated development of a solution to this common problem among pet owners.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9178565660641359}

All your games teach social and co-operative skills.\" - South Carolina <b>Play as friends, not as enemies!</b> Family Pastimes games foster the spirit of cooperation. Players help each other climb a mountain, make a community, complete a space exploration... They never play against each other. After all, the initial impulse to play a game is social; that is, we bring out a game because we want to do something together. How ironic then that in most games, we spend all our efforts trying to bankrupt someone, destroy their armies - in other words, to get rid of one another! At <b>Family Pastimes</b> we believe that people of different ages and abilities should be able to play side by side, each making their best contribution. We are all there together when we finish the game to take joy in our successes and wonder how we might work together even better the next time we play. Thus, Family Pastimes games will prove to be a friendly form of fun. Socialization, entertainment, academic learning, character growth, etc. - whatever your objectives, we invite you to realize them by cooperative means. We hope you enjoy playing and learning together! Players work together to rescue the damsel in distress in the Princess Game. As players move their pieces around the board, they uncover tools such as a boat, key, or magic potion. These are used to get past six obstacles that guard the princess: a moat, a guard dog, a sentry, a locked door, a dark tunnel, and a magic spell. It's a race against time, because in addition to objects, the board contains spaces that advance the coming of the night and the end of the game. Cooperation comes into play when players help each other come up with creative uses for the various objects. The horse, for example, might be used to swim the moat or run past the dog, or might be traded to the guard as a bribe. Since all players are working toward a common goal, everyone wins or loses as a team.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Family Pastimes Home Builders - A Multi-Cultural Co-operative Game\" COL feature VAL \"A real-life theme where players help to build as many homes as we can The homes are from different cultures, past and present, so we learn a bit about other kinds of shelter, too Enjoy family game time more by playing with one another rather than against each other For 1 to 8 players ages 5 through 9 Hand-made in Canada using recycled boards and papers, soy-based inks, water based glues and safe paints\" COL description VAL \"A real-life theme where players help to build as many homes as we can.

Natural Disasters can strike and wreck what we build - we have to be ready to take safety measures at the right time. We also can use the special card that lets us rebuild. The game nurtures discussion, planning and memory skills. Younger players start with a few homes - the more homes you add, the more complex the game!

Our customers say: \"Lots to talk about, and a very challenging game!\" - Alberta, Canada <b>Play as friends, not as enemies!</b> Family Pastimes games foster the spirit of cooperation. Players help each other climb a mountain, make a community, complete a space exploration... They never play against each other. After all, the initial impulse to play a game is social; that is, we bring out a game because we want to do something together. How ironic then that in most games, we spend all our efforts trying to bankrupt someone, destroy their armies - in other words, to get rid of one another! At <b>Family Pastimes</b> we believe that people of different ages and abilities should be able to play side by side, each making their best contribution. We are all there together when we finish the game to take joy in our successes and wonder how we might work together even better the next time we play. Thus, Family Pastimes games will prove to be a friendly form of fun. Socialization, entertainment, academic learning, character growth, etc. - whatever your objectives, we invite you to realize them by cooperative means. We hope you enjoy playing and learning together!\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9459013026311742}

It is often called the \"dream stone\" for its ability to help one access the non-physical spirit realms. It is a protective stone, and acts as a ward against negative energies. Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy. Jade can be used as a dream-enhancer by slipping a mala of it under your pillow or inside your pillow case while sleeping. THE MALA HAS BEEN HAND KNOTTED (KNOT BETWEEN EACH BEAD). Blessed and Energized with proper Mantras, Pujas and Spiritually activated by SWAMI BUDHIRAJA to give best results. Since a Yantra and Mala is a Man-Made object, it requires energization to infuse potency and power to benefit the owner. Before sending the Yantras or Malas, we get Pran Pratishtha (Energization) done by learned Pandits (Priests). WATER FROM RIVER GANGA (GANGES) IS USED FOR THE ENERGIZATION PURPOSE. Total number of beads 108+1, Mala has been made in traditional style with knots between beads.

They also work well for keeping pasta, rice, flour, sugar, crackers, cookies, and other cupboard or pantry items fresh for longer, securely stored, and neatly organized. Even more, the versatile storage containers can be used to transport lunches to and from work or school--or even for storing smaller kitchen, office, or craft items. Lock&Lock's full line of Classic food-storage containers offers a wide range of shapes and sizes--each with a securely locking lid for airtight storage and peace of mind. Furthermore, the clear body of the containers makes identifying contents easy--no labels required. Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers feature an innovative four-sided locking system for an airtight seal and watertight storage so food stays fresh longer and there's no messy leaks or spills to worry about. The four sides of the locking system promote an airtight seal due to equal pressure to all four sides, along with the hollow-center silicon sealing ring that makes it possible to lock tightly (the silicone sealing ring can be removed for cleaning if necessary). Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers not only offer an airtight and watertight seal, but they're also durably built for unbreakable, long-lasting use and hygienic, food-safe storage. The containers can withstand temperatures ranging from -4 degrees F to 210 degrees F, making them suitable for use in the freezer, microwave* (reheating only), and dishwasher (top-rack). The base and lid should NOT be used in the oven, under browning elements, or on the stove top. Another thoughtful design detail includes the fact that the containers can be nested together, and with the lid in place, they can be stacked one on top of the other--particularly useful where space is limited. *Unlock all four latches and loosen lid before use in microwave. Lock&Lock Classic lids feature four side flaps or \"wings\" that are hinged and slightly flared at the end for an easy grip when opening. More importantly, they come with holes (rectangular-shaped openings) that line up with matching knobs on the base of the containers, making it easy to latch the lid to the base, locking it into place. This patented blocking hole system maintains the integrity of the lid and helps promote an easy, tightly locked container. In addition to its blocking hole system, the Classic food-storage containers feature a blue hollow-center silicon ring in the lid that helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Generic silicon with a solid center doesn't compress as well and doesn't have the same restorative power as hollow-center silicon, which means an inferior seal. Lock&Lock's hollow-center silicon seal delivers superior compression and restoration power that helps ensure an airtight seal. When testing the freshness of foods, one of the most important factors is the permeability of the container. In comparison to other brands, the permeability of Lock&Lock products showed to be drastically better. The freshness test is determined throughout the world by how much moisture permeates various containers. Test results show Lock&Lock airtight containers allow in 3,000 - 6,000 times less moisture than other containers, making them far more airtight. Lock&Lock airtight containers passed the leakage test. Their four-sided locking system makes an airtight seal possible due to equal pressure on all four sides and the hollow-center silicone sealing ring. <div class=\"rightImage\" style=\"width:130px\"> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/lockandlock/B0054PHG2Q-kemti.jpg\" width=\"130\" height=\"91\" alt=\"Lock&Lock Classic\" /> <div class=\"imageCaption\">Passed the KEMTI bending test.</div></div> <h5>Durable Design</h5> Lock&Lock airtight containers have also passed the KEMTI bending test. The container and the wing were fixed to the bending test machine and bent 3,000,000 times 80 degrees left to right. If the container were to be used 10 times a day, it could be used for 821 years (semi-permanently). <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width:145px\"> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/lockandlock/B0054PHG2Q-healthy.jpg\" width=\"132\" height=\"92\" alt=\"Lock&Lock Classic\" /> <div class=\"imageCaption\">Hygienic and food-safe.</div></div> <h5>Healthy Living</h5> Lock&Lock Classic food-storage containers have passed the strict hygiene and safety tests of the U.S. FDA and German SGS. Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, the durable and heat-resistance containers are food-safe and health-friendly. When not in use, the cleverly designed food-storage containers nest together, both lids and bases, for compact storage in a drawer or on a shelf. The containers also offer a stacking system for maximum space efficiency. The flat lids make it easy to stack one container on top of another--a slight edge helps to keep stacked items in securely place, whether in the freezer, refrigerator, or cupboard. Whether just one or building a collection of several, Lock&Lock's Classic airtight containers offer a smart solution for food storage.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.7021217288635788}

With a patented reversible blade for sharp or blunt processing, and two speeds of operation, it is well equipped to handle a variety of jobs. <P>Though it has a high-speed motor and durable stainless-steel motor shaft, keep in mind that the Mini-Mate is designed for small amounts of food: 2 tablespoons is the maximum recommended for one batch, and food pieces should be no larger than 1/2 inch. Purchase it to complement, not replace, a larger, full-function food processor. An instruction book that accompanies the processor details how to process many common foods and troubleshoot problems so you know how to best use and care for your Mini Mate. <P>Cleanup and completion of small jobs is quicker and more efficient because of the small size, though the many parts of the Mini Mate require disassembly, careful cleaning, and reassembly, which does add to total cleaning time.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9960469102823344}

Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder?

comparable Lex Loop and is designed for full range of motion integrated movement drills and exercises. The increased padded cuff size provides a more secure and comfortable fit for all body types. SPRI rubber resistance products are created using a 'dipped process' rather than the more common and inexpensive 'extruded process' - making it one of the most durable and reliable tubes on the market! All SPRI rubber resistance products are made using Tuff Tube, a SPRI exclusive. This heavy-duty, high quality material has greater resistance to abrasion and tears to stand up to the rigorous demands of professional use.

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 10-inch fine-edged blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a sharp point. The hand-honed blade is slim and narrow to facilitate even, precise meat cutting. It is made with Henckels' Sintermetal Component Technology (SCT), which allows three different grades of steel to be combined to form a single piece, fusing together the blade, bolster, and tang. What does this mean in layman's terms? It means a strong, high-quality knife that will last a lifetime. Founded in 1731, the J.A.

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 10-inch specialty blade on this knife--sometimes called a Granton or Kullenschliff --features a \"\"hollow-ground\"\" edge specially designed for fine cutting duties. Air pockets develop in the hollows along the blade's edge, keeping even the thinnest-sliced meats from clinging to the blade. In addition to its superb meat-slicing abilities, this specialty knife is also great for slicing layer cakes and biscuit bases. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell</i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines. Four Star knives were designed and developed in close cooperation with renowned professional chefs. The result was a fully forged knife with a unique molded handle. The Four Star line contains knives for all tasks, and includes the following open stock knife types: parer, bread, peeling, sandwich, utility, carving, chefs, granton edge slicer, santoku, and others. Four Star knives are also available in a range of block sets and gift sets. <td> </tr> </table> <P> <B>A Higher Standard in Knife Construction</B><P> Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of exclusive-formula, high-carbon, no-stain steel under the all-new Sigmaforge standard. As a result, Four Star knives have improved quality consistency, lasting sharpness, and perfect geometry. Sigmaforge one-piece construction also provides high precision and improved stability of the blade and steel structure, thus improving cutting-edge retention for lasting sharpness. In addition, Four Star knives use J.A. Henckels Friodur ice hardening for corrosion resistance, a process that also contributes to cutting-edge retention. <P> <center> <img src=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-twinselect-forging.jpg align=\"center\"></center> <p clear=left> <B>It's All in The Grip:</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar-handle.jpg </td> <td> The Four Star series features high impact polypropylene handles that are permanently bonded to the knife blades without any gaps.

He got the answering machine and said \"What's going on over there at Sector 9?\" which to him and us meant a house full of nine balls. The message on the machine was heard and the name not only had a nice ring to it but seemed fitting as well so it stuck. The interest had been apparent from everyone who saw us skate by so we started making skateboards in our backyard.

SALES PRODUCT does NOT include the glass jar, comes in a clear Poly bag. </br> PLEASE NOTE: SrA12O4:Eu is a solid odorless, nonflammable, pale yellow powder, heavier than water. It is chemically and biologically inert. When activated with a suitable dopant (Europium) it takes on a different structure and becomes a phosphorescence emitting its glow. It now requires UV (Ultra Violet) in the higher spectrum to charge the crystals and make them GLOW. UV light is the electromagnetic radiation from sunlight with a wavelength shorter than white light. </br> In summer the powder supercharges because of the UV rays from sunlight, and this makes the powder REALLY POP. However, in the winter months when there is limited UV in the suns rays it is harder to charge the powder. We use UV black lights to help charge the powders in the winter months. These are specially designed black lights you can purchase from stores. </br> We DO NOT give glow times on our products because we cannot guarantee this, there are too many factors involved, some we have already spoken about. </br> This pigment is daytime invisible, meaning it is an off-white color during the day & glows its individual color in the dark. </br> ALL PHOTOS AND IMAGES PROPERTY OF GLOMANIA & PROGLOW USA, NAIL ART COURTESY OF MARY FINOCCHIARO\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Uchida Calligraphy Paint Marker,Chisel Tip,Flat 2mm Nib,Gold (UCH125SGLD)\" COL feature VAL \"Delivers precise lettering with a chisel point pen tip and flat 2mm nib Design elegant personalized gifts, invitations, documents and announcements Use on paper, glass, wood, porcelain, metal and mirrors\" COL description VAL \"Calligraphy paint marker delivers precise lettering with a chisel point pen tip and flat 2mm nib.

The product comes in powdered form and it is simply added on a daily basis to dry or wet food. Dogs and cats like the taste of the small amount that is added. Proden plaqueoff animal does not rely on topical application or friction. The product is ingested and works systemically. The natural compound in the product comes out through the saliva and works to break down the bacterial biofilm that forms on the teeth and gums. This is how the natural bacteria in the mouth take hold onto the teeth and gums, colonizing and creating the oral problems of plaque and tartar, bad breathe and gingivitis. It does not change the ph of the mouth or kill off the normal levels of bacteria. Proden plaqueoff has been proven to reduce plaque and tartar on the teeth and gums, depending on composition, diet and how long it has been there. It then works to prevent bad breath, plaque and tartar from returning. Patients generally begin to see results over a 2-8 week period, and will see further benefits with continued use. Proden plaqueoff animal is made from a specific strain of selected seaweed harvested from above scandinavia. This seaweed has developed a natural defensive mechanism against bacterial biofilm.

Both the handles and stainless-steel lid stylishly present a dual matte/polished finish that handsomely contrasts with the black pan body. Scanpan Professional pans are safe for any burner type, including induction; oven-use up to 500 degrees F; and dishwasher-cleaning, although washing by hand will best preserve the nonstick finish. In response to environmental concerns regarding nonstick finishes, Scanpan in 2007 introduced its Green Tek nonstick technology. Working with its suppliers, Scanpan is the first cookware company to completely eliminate the use of the harmful chemical PFOA from the entire process used to make its nonstick compound. The new PFOA-free nonstick finish is now found on all Scanpan Classic and Professional cookware. Scanpan covers its cast-aluminum cookware with a full lifetime warranty. <I>--Ann Bieri</I> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/green-tek-logo.jpg\" align=\"left\"></td> <td> <P> <B>About Green Tek Nonstick Technology:</B><P> In the more recent past, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken the leading manufacturer of nonstick compounds to task over excessive emissions of PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid). PFOA has been used as a catalyst in the production of PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene), the basic building block for all nonstick cookware surfaces. PFOA is a chemical that is hard to break down in the environment. It has a half life of 3.8 years, meaning that if there are 4 grams of PFOA in the body today, the body will have 2 grams in it in four years from now, 1 gram in eight years from now and so on. The human metabolism does not remove PFOA. While it is not a carcinogen or toxin and is generally assumed inert and not harmful to your health, it is environmentally unfriendly and just sticks around forever. That is why the EPA and the leading nonstick manufacturer have agreed that by 2010, the amount of PFOA used to produce PTFE compounds need to be cut by 95%, and by 2015 no PFOA could be used, at all. Towards the end of this process, PFOA is completely extracted via ionization filters. Even if any traces of PFOA were still present by the time the nonstick compound reached the cookware factory, the pan surface curing temperatures would destroy such remnants. The same is true for the old nonstick compound used for Scanpan Classic and Scanpan Professional. That&#146;s why Scanpan has always been able to present the finished product as not containing PFOA. <td> </tr> </table> <B></B><P> Scanpan Cookware has always been PFOA free, but the negative publicity that PFOA and, by extension, PTFE had received over the last few years, had caused Scanpan to work closely with their suppliers to find a substitute for PFOA that is biodegradable. Scanpan received patents on PFOA-free technology in 2007 and has been producing Scanpan Classic and Scanpan Professional with this new process since spring 2007. With their new Green Tek technology, there is no PFOA used at any stage of the entire process, resulting in a \"clean and green\" nonstick PTFE compound, the production of which no longer uses chemicals that could have a negative impact on the environment. The performance of the Scanpan Green Tek surface is not different in any way from the performance of Scanpan's previous surface. And Scanpan continues to incorporate their patented ceramic-titanium technology. Scanpan is safe to use with metal utensils and each piece comes with a lifetime warranty. <B>Taking Care of Scanpan Professional Cookware:</B> 1. Before first use, remove all packing materials, labels, and tags, and wash pan in hot, soapy water. Rinse well and dry. 2. Heat pan to working temperature. Medium heat is typically sufficient for frying and sauteing. Since each stove top has its own settings, find the best heat setting for your stove by starting at a lower setting, then gradually increase until water splashed on the pan surface evaporates immediately with a sizzle. High heat can be used for other applications, like boiling water, stir frying, oven roasting etc. Note: Scanpan Professional is oven safe to 500 degrees F. 3. Scanpan Professional can be used without oil, butter, or other seasonings, making it especially suitable for low fat diets. 4. After use, remove food and clean Scanpan cookware with warm, soapy water. Scanpan Professional wipes clean with a sponge. Scanpan Professional is dishwasher safe. Scanpan recommends using extra care if you decide to clean the pans in the dishwasher to prevent damage to plates, glassware, etc. 5. When storing Scanpan cookware and nesting (placing smaller pots inside larger pots) is required due to space limitations, Scanpan recommends placing a paper or cloth towel between the pots and pans to prevent scuff marks.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9671009586520349}

Together they form an elite group known as the three Ms. Masahiro MV-H knives are produced by Masahiro Co., Ltd. in Seki, Japan. Among the numerous ranges of knives produced by Masahiro, the MV-H range is the top of the line. It is indisputably the best range from one of the best factories in Japan. The cutting edge is asymmetrical: 80% on the right side of the blade and 20% on the left side, then polished to a mirror finish. This tapered style edge takes pressure off food for a perfect finished cut. This asymmetrical edge is derived from traditional one-sided Japanese knives which are also 80/20 asymmetrical. The 80 percent side on the MV-H is only  high as compared to the  on a traditional Japanese knife, but the idea is the same. An asymmetrical edge is approximately 35% thinner than a 50/50 straight edge. The Masahiro knives are amazingly light weight, yet perfectly balanced. The handle is a composition plastic handle which is remarkably durable and is much more practical and longer lasting than a laminated wood handle. The composite handle is resistant to bacteria, which keeps the knife very hygienic in daily use. The handles are a three rivet design and use a very wide full tang, almost as wide as the handles themselves. This design provides plenty of room for the rivets and still allows room for the handle to cover the tang, which results in an incredibly smooth rounded handle that feels great in your hand. The MV-H range is made from MBS-26 high carbon stainless steel. This MBS-26 is proprietary to Masahiro; however, it comes from the VG family like VG-10 that the Kasumi Damascus knives first used. The MBS-26 stainless steel is treated by three stages of quenching, sub-zero treating and tempering until the steel reaches a hardness of 58-60 HRC. Masahiro believes this is the ideal hardness the for a kitchen knife with the features of the MV-H.\"", "match": "0", "match_confidence": 0.6431603416407252}

Several woodworking magazines have tested Whiteside versus the competition and selected Whiteside as the winner for best router bits available in the market.

Located in Western North Carolina near the furniture manufacturing town of Hickory, the company was often involved in making repairs or special parts for the furniture and woodworking field. A strong commitment to customer problem-solving, a can-do attitude, and innovative ideas, along with a growing core of dedicated employees, helped the business evolve into a manufacturer of woodworking equipment and tooling. Primarily through repeat business and referrals, the tooling business continued to grow to meet a demand for quality production router bits as well as custom application tooling. Today, Whiteside Machine occupies a 40,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility and produces a complete line of solid carbide and carbide tipped router bits. Whiteside's quality, innovation, and customer commitment is still present in our superb product line, in the design of custom tooling to fill special customer requirements, and in the development of special machinery and tooling for our own manufacturing use.

They also work well for keeping pasta, rice, flour, sugar, crackers, cookies, and other cupboard or pantry items fresh for longer, securely stored, and neatly organized. Even more, the versatile storage containers can be used to transport lunches to and from work or school--or even for storing smaller kitchen, office, or craft items. Lock&Lock's full line of Classic food-storage containers offers a wide range of shapes and sizes--each with a securely locking lid for airtight storage and peace of mind. Furthermore, the clear body of the containers makes identifying contents easy--no labels required. Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers feature an innovative four-sided locking system for an airtight seal and watertight storage so food stays fresh longer and there's no messy leaks or spills to worry about. The four sides of the locking system promote an airtight seal due to equal pressure to all four sides, along with the hollow-center silicon sealing ring that makes it possible to lock tightly (the silicone sealing ring can be removed for cleaning if necessary). Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers not only offer an airtight and watertight seal, but they're also durably built for unbreakable, long-lasting use and hygienic, food-safe storage. The containers can withstand temperatures ranging from -4 degrees F to 210 degrees F, making them suitable for use in the freezer, microwave* (reheating only), and dishwasher (top-rack). The base and lid should NOT be used in the oven, under browning elements, or on the stove top. Another thoughtful design detail includes the fact that the containers can be nested together, and with the lid in place, they can be stacked one on top of the other--particularly useful where space is limited. *Unlock all four latches and loosen lid before use in microwave. Lock&Lock Classic lids feature four side flaps or \"wings\" that are hinged and slightly flared at the end for an easy grip when opening. More importantly, they come with holes (rectangular-shaped openings) that line up with matching knobs on the base of the containers, making it easy to latch the lid to the base, locking it into place. This patented blocking hole system maintains the integrity of the lid and helps promote an easy, tightly locked container. In addition to its blocking hole system, the Classic food-storage containers feature a blue hollow-center silicon ring in the lid that helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Generic silicon with a solid center doesn't compress as well and doesn't have the same restorative power as hollow-center silicon, which means an inferior seal. Lock&Lock's hollow-center silicon seal delivers superior compression and restoration power that helps ensure an airtight seal. When testing the freshness of foods, one of the most important factors is the permeability of the container. In comparison to other brands, the permeability of Lock&Lock products showed to be drastically better. The freshness test is determined throughout the world by how much moisture permeates various containers. Test results show Lock&Lock airtight containers allow in 3,000 - 6,000 times less moisture than other containers, making them far more airtight. Lock&Lock airtight containers passed the leakage test. Their four-sided locking system makes an airtight seal possible due to equal pressure on all four sides and the hollow-center silicone sealing ring. <div class=\"rightImage\" style=\"width:130px\"> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/lockandlock/B0054PHG2Q-kemti.jpg\" width=\"130\" height=\"91\" alt=\"Lock&Lock Classic\" /> <div class=\"imageCaption\">Passed the KEMTI bending test.</div></div> <h5>Durable Design</h5> Lock&Lock airtight containers have also passed the KEMTI bending test. The container and the wing were fixed to the bending test machine and bent 3,000,000 times 80 degrees left to right. If the container were to be used 10 times a day, it could be used for 821 years (semi-permanently). <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width:145px\"> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/lockandlock/B0054PHG2Q-healthy.jpg\" width=\"132\" height=\"92\" alt=\"Lock&Lock Classic\" /> <div class=\"imageCaption\">Hygienic and food-safe.</div></div> <h5>Healthy Living</h5> Lock&Lock Classic food-storage containers have passed the strict hygiene and safety tests of the U.S. FDA and German SGS. Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, the durable and heat-resistance containers are food-safe and health-friendly. When not in use, the cleverly designed food-storage containers nest together, both lids and bases, for compact storage in a drawer or on a shelf. The containers also offer a stacking system for maximum space efficiency. The flat lids make it easy to stack one container on top of another--a slight edge helps to keep stacked items in securely place, whether in the freezer, refrigerator, or cupboard. Whether just one or building a collection of several, Lock&Lock's Classic airtight containers offer a smart solution for food storage.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Lamson &amp; Goodnow 6-Inch KnifeSafe\" COL feature VAL \"KnifeSafe for 4-Inch to 6-Inch knives This easy-to-use case protects knife blades and people Completely covers the blade and securely holds the knife in place for safe storage and transportation The case is made of a clear Polypropylene Features locking tabs that clamp tight and rubber pads that secure the knife\" COL description VAL \"This Lamson & Goodnow easy-to-use case protects knife blades and people.

High carbon, no-stain steel bl The thin, long blade of this set's knife makes any fine-slicing job a breeze. The fork's prongs are faceted rather than flat and are exceptionally attractive. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish the Pro S line from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Handles in the Pro S line are heavier and smaller, which makes the knives less weight-forward. The steel used in this line is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines, and the knives are constructed using the same technique. High-tech welding combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, giving the knife its distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Though traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, Henckels claims that the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel.

We got started in apiculture and learned how to raise our own beehives by attending classes organized through our local beekeeping association. With each passing season, though, we noticed there were fewer and fewer wild bees around and more and more beehives collapsing without any obvious cause. After suffering the loss of our own hives, we decided it was time to take action and help save the bees. That's why we established Humble Bee and agreed on a mission - to give back 10% of our profits to charities that encourage local beekeeping activities and promote bee conservation efforts. We want to get more people involved with beekeeping and help newcomers establish their own apiaries. Our beekeeping products are built to the highest safety and quality standards. In fact, we only sell products that we've tested and use at our own apiaries! We promise that you'll love your new Humble Bee gear as much as we do, or we'll give you a full refund - no questions asked. And, to top things off, we guarantee the caliber of all our products with a hassle-free 2-year warranty.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.8643677084417294}

Each one is lined with a foam insert for effective mechanical pre-filtering. Instant-release T-handles let you lift and separate the baskets quickly and easily, making routine maintenance simpler. Fluval FX6 also features Smart Pump Technology, which provides optimal filter performance. This advanced technological feature employs an electronic circuit board that continually monitors the pump. Impeller speed and force are constantly measured to ensure powerful output and energy efficiency. It also manages the filter's self-starting feature and evacuates air that may enter or build up within the filtration system. On a 12-hour cycle, the pump will pause and allow trapped air to escape, ensuring the best filtration efficiency at all times. Only 21\" in height, Fluval FX6 fits under most aquariums.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"JW Pet Company Activitoys The Wave Bird Toy\" COL feature VAL \"Translucent multi colored hanging toy Features beads, mirrors and bell Stimulates your bird and encourages play Activate your bird's body, mind and soul!

Near perfect in design, the pan is constructed of three layers of metal; two stainless steel outer layers with an aluminum core. The stainless steel exterior combined with the aluminum core allows the pan to be used on all types of stovetops, including induction, and heats the pan evenly to eliminate hot spots. Additionally, the pan has a non-stick coating which makes food removal and clean-up a breeze. The classically sloped sides help prevent messes, and when you're finished cooking, the pan can be hung through the handle's eyelet for convenient storage. Producing some of the finest cookware in the nation, All-Clad has been featured in many high class and gourmet restaurants for its superior performance and aesthetically designed pieces crafted from American artists using the finest metals. A firm believer in quality over convenience, All-Clad's metals are formulated and bonded with cooking performance in mind, and are combined with stunning designs to provide you with the best cooking experience possible. The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the steel. This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 10 inches in diameter, perfect for cooking tuna or tofu, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for a healthful meal. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's heat. Although Stainless cookware is dishwasher-safe, nonstick pieces should be hand washed. <i>--Fred Brack</i> <b>From the Manufacturer</b> <br> <b>All-Clad Stainless Construction</b> <br> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cookware/allclad.stainless.gif\" width=\"244\" height=\"129\" align=\"left\"> Each piece of All-Clad cookware features a unique metal bonding construction. All-Clad Stainless cookware sandwiches a thick core of three separate layers of aluminum between an easy-to-clean, highly polished 18/10 stainless-steel cooking surface and a magnetic stainless-steel exterior. The aluminum core retains heat and evenly distributes it along the bottom and up the sidewalls of the cookware. The stainless interior is stick-resistant and cleans easily. The magnetic stainless-steel exterior gives the cookware a gleaming finish. All-Clad Stainless also features the company&#x92;s signature \"stay-cool\" long handles, lids fashioned from gleaming 18/10 stainless steel, and highly durable stainless-steel rivets. All-Clad Stainless cookware is one of five collections from All-Clad Metalcrafters. Designed to work on conventional gas and electric ranges, as well as induction cooktops, All-Clad Stainless cookware is the best-selling collection in a full line that includes All-Clad LTD, Cop-R-Chef, Master Chef 2, and Copper Core. <b>Features and Benefits</b> <br> All-Clad pans with a stainless interior cooking surface are oven-safe up to 500 degrees. All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include: <ul> <li>Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer. <li>Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you won&#x92;t have \"hot spots\" when cooking.  <li>Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface. <li>Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles. <li>Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods. <li>Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pan&#x92;s edges to seal in flavor of your foods. <li>The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops.  <li>The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface. </ul> <b>Warranty</b> <br> From date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

Made in the USA.<br><br><b>Product Features</b><br>&#149; 3-ply bonded construction for a lifetime of use<br>&#149; Mirror-finished magnetic stainless-steel exterior is hand-polished to a lustrous shine<br>&#149; Pure aluminum core covers bottom of the pan and extends up the sides for greater heat conductivity<br>&#149; Easy-to-clean, ultra-smooth nonstick interior prevents foods from sticking<br>&#149; Cookware maintains even heat distribution that prevents \"hot spots\" when cooking<br>&#149; Signature stay-cool handles are cast from solid stainless-steel and designed for ergonomic comfort<br>&#149; Handles and rivets are polished stainless-steel creating a striking impression<br>&#149; High-strength, noncorrosive stainless-steel rivets keep handles permanently secure, making cooking safer<br>&#149; Bonded cookware handcrafted in the USA The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the steel. This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes it clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 12 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep, which is large enough for a professional kitchen but fully functional in a home kitchen, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for healthful meals. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's heat. Although Stainless cookware is dishwasher-safe, nonstick pieces should be hand washed. <i>--Fred Brack</i> <b>From the Manufacturer</b> <br> <b>All-Clad Stainless Construction</b> <br> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cookware/allclad.stainless.gif\" width=\"244\" height=\"129\" align=\"left\"> Each piece of All-Clad cookware features a unique metal bonding construction. All-Clad Stainless cookware sandwiches a thick core of three separate layers of aluminum between an easy-to-clean, highly polished 18/10 stainless-steel cooking surface and a magnetic stainless-steel exterior. The aluminum core retains heat and evenly distributes it along the bottom and up the sidewalls of the cookware. The stainless interior is stick-resistant and cleans easily. The magnetic stainless-steel exterior gives the cookware a gleaming finish. All-Clad Stainless also features the companys signature \"stay-cool\" long handles, lids fashioned from gleaming 18/10 stainless steel, and highly durable stainless-steel rivets. All-Clad Stainless cookware is one of five collections from All-Clad Metalcrafters. Designed to work on conventional gas and electric ranges, as well as induction cooktops, All-Clad Stainless cookware is the best-selling collection in a full line that includes All-Clad LTD, Cop-R-Chef, Master Chef 2, and Copper Core. <b>Features and Benefits</b> <br> All-Clad pans with a stainless interior cooking surface are oven-safe up to 500 degrees. All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include: <ul> <li>Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer. <li>Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you wont have \"hot spots\" when cooking. <li>Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface. <li>Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles. <li>Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods. <li>Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pans edges to seal in flavor of your foods. <li>The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops. <li>The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface. </ul> <b>Warranty</b> <br> From date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keepers Friend. To use the Bar Keepers Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keepers Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keepers Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack. Both of these one-pot comfort food specialty pans comes with All-Clads popular high dome-shaped lid. Other specialty pans include a larger brasier pan with domed-shape lid; a complete family of round-shaped saucier saucepans for versatile stove-top cooking; a flare-sided Windsor pan in two sizes, designed for reduction and the creation of rich sauces; and a contemporary \"Soup for Two\" 3-1/2-quart soup pot; casseroles; an open stir fry; a versatile wok-style chefs pan; and a \"Pasta Pentola\" 7-quart stockpot with colander insert and lid. All saucepans, casseroles, saut pans, stock pots, and specialty items come with lids. Double boiler and steamer inserts, including the large steamer insert for 6-quart, 8-quart and 12-quart stockpots, are available as well. Stainless cookware sets are available in various sizes, from a starter 5-piece to a complete 10-piece set. <b>About All-Clad Metalcrafters</b> <br> Based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, All-Clad Metalcrafters markets premium quality cookware to department and specialty stores in the United States, along with premium All-Clad bonded bakeware, All-Clad All-Professional kitchen tools, and a growing assortment of kitchen accessories, including All-Clads upscale tea kettle, measuring scoop set, stainless-steel mixing bowls, kitchen colanders, and 1-cup measuring cup.

With each passing season, though, we noticed there were fewer and fewer wild bees around and more and more beehives collapsing without any obvious cause. After suffering the loss of our own hives, we decided it was time to take action and help save the bees. That's why we established Humble Bee and agreed on a mission - to give back 10% of our profits to charities that encourage local beekeeping activities and promote bee conservation efforts. We want to get more people involved with beekeeping and help newcomers establish their own apiaries. Our beekeeping products are built to the highest safety and quality standards. In fact, we only sell products that we've tested and use at our own apiaries! We promise that you'll love your new Humble Bee gear as much as we do, or we'll give you a full refund - no questions asked.

Birds flock from miles around to consume these flavorful minerals. Hardened minerals provide a variable surface that attracts the birds curiosity. Solves two problems associated with most mineral blocks: Problem: Many birds just ignore the block, preventing them from ingesting vital nutrients. Solution: Once the bird roosts on the perch, it naturally rubs its beak along the wood and minerals; birds find the taste irresistible! From then on, the bird will chew through the perch to gain access to the mineral center. Problem: Some birds aggressively attack a new block, demolishing it in a few minutes.

Large \"G\" Scale Size Recommended for ages 14 years old & up 50 Pieces Total ***Not a single piece*** Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track&#039;. Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power Supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. DO NOT USE STEEL WOOL TO CLEAN YOUR TRACK. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains.

A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity. When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: <b>Grinding mechanism: </b>Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features. <b>Design and appearance: </b>Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table decor. <b>Ease of Use: </b>A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand. Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty. Peugeot's <b>Pepper Grinding Mechanism</b> is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available Peugeot's <b>Salt Crushing Mechanism</b> features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill. Peugeot's <b>Spice Mechanism</b> is made of ceramic, and is specially designed to grind dried spices and flat leafy herbs to release their essential oils. It is particularly effective with dried aromatic herbs such as thyme, parsley, basil, oregano, and herbs de Provence, as well as dried seeds such as cumin. Peugeot's <b>Chili Pepper Mechanism</b> is made of case hardened steel for optimal hardness and resilience. This patented mechanism features a pre-cutting system and dual chamber reservoir. For use with dry, hot chilis such as birds tongue, African devils and Piri Piri. The <b>Nutmeg Shaving Mechanism</b> is made of treated stainless steel which is corrosion resistant, and offers superior edge retention. The Peugeot nutmeg shaver is equipped with a double stainless steel grater blade and a strong claw which enables the whole nutmeg to be very finely shaved, while keeping fingers safe. Intended for use with whole nutmeg nuts. Peugeot's <b>Wet Salt mechanism</b> has been specially designed for wet sea salt: a spiral guides the salt, ensuring that it does not stick together. The mechanism is made of ceramic because wet salt crystals are soft (wear is not an issue) but corrosive. Intended for use with damp sea salts such as Sel de Guerande. The <b>Coffee Grinding Mechanism</b> found in all Peugeot coffee mills is the foundation of Peugeot's grinding legacy. The case-hardened steel mechanism efficiently cracks and grinds coffee beans to the desired consistency:from espresso fine to coffee- press coarse. For best results, hold mill and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only To adjust the Grind on manual mills not equipped with u'Select, turn the adjustment nut located on the top of the mill. - clockwise to obtain a finer grind - counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind Electric mills permit single-handed use, leaving you free to cook at the same time. Just press the button to start grinding. To adjust the grind on an electric mill, turn the thumbwheel grind adjustment (found below the grinding mechanism on electric mills that are not equipped with the u'Select system). - Clockwise to obtain a finer grind, - Counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind. Classic Electric Salt Mills (not fitted with the u'Select grind adjustment system) are pre-set to medium and cannot be adjusted. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Oster 4937 Mini Jar Accessory\" COL feature VAL \"Blend and chop in the container and then store Convenient for making baby food, grinding spices, and coffee beans BPA Free Plastic container for long-lasting quality and durability Fits most Oster blenders\" COL description VAL \"Do you grind your coffee beans or baby food in your blender, but hate to because you don't want to clean up the whole jar just for a little amount?

Introduce a new generation to this silly, electronic board game for kids FUN AND UNPREDICTABLE GAMEPLAY: The game features a surprising buzzer and a flashing nose when a player hits the sides with the tweezers\" COL description VAL \"In the Operation game, kids get to be the doctor and make Cavity Sam better or get the buzzer! Perform successful action noted on the cards by picking funny ailment pieces out of the game tray with a pair of tweezers. But watch out! If the tweezers touch the sides of the openings, the buzzer goes off and Cavity Sam's nose lights up! Then players look for their Specialist card that fits that action to earn an even higher fee. The player with the most money after all of the Funatomy parts have been removed wins the game! Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. Surely countless medical careers have been launched because of this humorous game. The Operation game board features Sam the patient, lying atop a red plastic \"operating table\" with 12 body cavities exposed. Players perform highly skilled procedures with a pair of tweezers such as removing a broken heart or butterflies in the stomach. This kind of surgery requires a steady hand! Doctors must remove the offending body part without touching the metal lining of the cavity. Touch the metal edge, and you'll set off the buzzer and make Sam's nose light up. Then the designated Specialist steps in--for double the fee! If you're playing solo, try performing all 12 operations without getting zapped. Two AA batteries are required. Operation is for one or more players. <i>--Elizabeth Ward</i>\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Mouse Trap Board Game For Kids Ages 6 and Up (Amazon Exclusive)\" COL feature VAL \"CLASSIC MOUSE TRAP GAMEPLAY: Do you remember playing the Mouse Trap game when you were a child?

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for 19th-century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. The company even fabricated and erected a series of IBM \"tent cities\" just outside Binghamton, housing thousands of IBM salesmen during the company's annual stockholders meeting, which had outgrown its previous locale. With the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, renowned explorer Sir Edmund Hillary used Eureka's new and innovative Draw-Tite tent--with its practical, freestanding external frame--in a Himalayan expedition to Nepal (Hillary had climbed to the summit of Mt. Everest only six years earlier). In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants during the first all-American Mt. Everest Expedition, where explorers braved fierce 60-plus mph winds and temperatures reached below -20F. Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s, targeting it to backpackers and families. The first to employ the StormShield design, the lightweight, self-supporting backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents in the industry, with sales reaching over 1 million by its 10-year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as companions on other historic expeditions, including the American Women's Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent years, Eureka designed and donated tents to Eric Simonson and his team. The group took two historic research expeditions to Mt. Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history by finding the remains of George Mallory, but the overall mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found several historical artifacts that are now on display at the Smithsonian. <br> <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all-purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in. If you're a backpacker, alpine climber, or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to use something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall, and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three-season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproof camping. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four-season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types: freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floorplan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one- and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it with less weight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9983675110211778}

But that doesn't mean he/she is a size small for all the clothes. Different designers and manufacturers use their own size charts. So the measurements given in a size SMALL by manufacturer &quot;A&quot; will be a size XS in manufacturer B's size chart. Don't buy a particular size because that is what you always buy in a pet shop or online store. Always look at the size chart for chest girth and length and confirm the size before you commit to buy. <b>3.If any of the measurements are 'between' two sizes, choose the larger size.</b> If your measurements are toward the upper end of the range given for a particular size, you may also want to choose the larger size, as you may also wish to do for heavily coated dogs to accommodate all that fur. <b>4.Take each measurement a bit loosely</b>. Take each measurement a bit loosely, so there will be room for your dog to move and breathe, but not too loose. (the measurement for Belly Bands is the exception -- it needs to be a bit snug) Please measure carefully before buying and email us if you have any questions about fit before you bid or make a purchase. <b>*About Shipment*</b> Our warehouse is located in China and all the parcels are shipped by ePacket(A service of EMS) internationally.Normally it takes 5~18 business days(except weekends) to arrive with tracking number,you can track it from the website of EMS or www.usps.com in detail.The estimated shipping time is not guaranteed because the real shipping time is depends on your custom.Feel free to contact us if necessary.Thanks.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9967712359523215}

Individuals or teams stare at an image on a card for 30 seconds (more challenging games can be played by shortening the time) and then answer questions about what they saw.

As a result, even people with knee and ankle trouble can exercise hard. Octane also added several workout boosters. Called GluteKicker, ArmBlaster, and X-Mode, the boosters challenge and motivate you to even greater levels of effort. The GluteKicker booster targets your glutes, hips, and thighs, with intense lower-body intervals to get your legs in tiptop shape. The ArmBlaster booster does the same for your upper body, rigorously toning your pecs, biceps, triceps, back, and more. And for full cross-training, try the X-Mode virtual personal trainer, which includes eight challenging prompts to get your entire body working. The Q35c is designed to support your body throughout your workout. The machine's 20.5-inch stride length, for example, is comfortable whether you're striding forward or backward, while the 1.8-inch pedal spacing mimics human biomechanics while minimizing stress on your lower back. The machine also offers a low step-up height, making it effortless to get on and off--a great feature for older users or people recovering from injury. Workout-wise, the Q35c offers 10 preset programs, 20 resistance levels, and four customizable \"goal\" programs. The \"goal\" programs are great for users who want to design their own routines, such as workouts with distance or calorie burning targets. Or you can just get on the machine and go, with an auto QuickStart function that launches a workout immediately. No buttons to press or programs to select. The Q35c even goes above and beyond traditional ellipticals with features like the MOM mode. This movement management feature promotes family safety and peace of mind for parents by disabling console buttons and restricting movements, so your little one can't climb on the machine and start moving. Other features include stationary handlebars that take your arms out of play (ideal for building core and leg strength); contact heart rate grips; a DedicatedLogic button that makes it easy to program workouts; built-in transport wheels; and a space-efficient footprint that's significantly shorter than other premium ellipticals or treadmills. <table align=right width=200 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/B004IACGSW-2.jpg\" border=0 align=top><br><br><small><i><b>The console includes a water bottle holder, MP3 player hutch, and reading rack.</b></i></small></td></tr></table> <b>Specifications</b><br> <ul> <li>QuadLink drive: Yes <li>Electronic stride adjustment: No <li>Stride length: 20.5 inches, fixed <li>Pedal spacing: 1.8 inches <li>Step-up height: 4 inches <li>Console fan: No <li>Soft grip pedals: No <li>Water bottle holder: Yes <li>MP3 player holder: Yes <li>Reading rack: Yes <li>Transport wheels: Yes <li>DedicatedLogic programming: Yes <li>QuickStart: Yes <li>Cool down: Yes <li>MOM mode: Yes <li>Heart rate: Yes, contact <li>Resistance levels: 20 <li>Workout programs: 8 <li>Preset resistance programs: Manual, random, custom interval, beginner <li>Goal programs: 350 calories, 750 calories, 10k, 1/2 marathon <li>Workout boosters: GluteKicker, ArmBlaster, X-Mode <li>Capacity: 300 pounds <li>Footprint: 26 by 65 inches <li>Footprint (live area): 26 by 76 inches <li>Weight: 210 pounds <li>Warranty: Lifetime on frame, 5 years on parts, 1 year on labor </ul> <b>About Octane Fitness</b><br> Octane Fitness was founded by two fitness industry entrepreneurs with a bold mission to reshape and perfect elliptical machines.

Selectable light timer (Test, 1 min, 5 min or 20 min). <div class=\"aplus\" ><div class=\"two-third-col\"> Designed to provide safety, convenience, and security outside the home, the Heath Zenith motion-sensing security light (model SL-5512-BZ) provides reliability and peace of mind at a price you can afford. The SL-5512-BZ features 240-degree motion detection at up to 100 feet, and it uses two 150-watt halogen bulbs (included)&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;for 300 watts of total illumination. This model comes in bronze, but it's also available in white. This security light also features Heath Zenith's patented DualBrite technology, which provides energy saving two-level lighting operating at half power until motion is detected and full power lighting when motion is detected. Studies show that light is the #1 deterrent to crime, and Heath Zenith's intelligent motion lighting fixtures help give the appearance of a startled homeowner turning on the lights to investigate what's going on outside. They also provide convenient illumination when you need it most, whether you're working outside at night or needing to see the steps more clearly to avoid a fall. Lights are activated when motion is detected, so there's no need to waste electricity by leaving the lights on all night. You can choose between three auto modes&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;1, 5, or 20 minutes of illumination after motion triggers the light. In DualBrite mode, you can choose 3 hours, 6 hours, or dusk to dawn. When constant light is needed, this motion-activated light has a manual override mode that allows it to function as switch-controlled light for constant on, dusk-to-dawn lighting. Heath Zenith uses superior pulse-count motion detection technology, which prevents false triggering by reading heat and movement in pulses as opposed to single occurrences. As a result, only substantial motion is detected, such as humans and animals. This security light offers Heath Zenith's exclusive RangeBoost feature, which uses double pulse-count technology to reduce false triggering and allows it to reliably detect motion farther than the competition&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;adding 30 feet of motion detection range from the light fixture.

It is a plastic basket muzzle that offers a great deal of security, and they go on a lot easier than most muzzles. They come in different sizes, please refer to sizing chart and instructions below. If you are looking for a good utility muzzle that will last for years and years, this is your best choice. All are made with polyethylene plastic with three reinforced rubber straps. The clear plastic muzzle is softer and more flexible than the white or black style plastic muzzles. These muzzles are not designed for muzzle fighting training. DESIGN & USES Can be worn for extended periods without inhibiting the dogs breathing, barking, and panting. Dogs can drink with the muzzle on, using a water bowl or bucket. It is best to \"teach\" your dog that it is okay to put the muzzle into the water before leaving the dog unattended for any period of time. Prevents wound licking, and eating rocks, garbage, poison, etc. Prevents injuries from dog fights. Allows dogs to use some modes of transportation when properly muzzled, which some transportation companies require. FITTING THE DOG The vinyl nose piece should be just below the dogs stop with the end of the muzzle touching the dogs nose. When on the dog: pull the muzzle out and down; pull the muzzle out and up. If at some point the muzzle comes off, its either too loose or too big. The muzzle should fit comfortably and allow the dog to pant and bark. SIZING TIPS & CHART There are a few things you need to know about sizing a muzzle for your dog: The muzzle cannot be longer than your dogs actual \"nose length\". If the muzzle is longer than your dog's nose length, the muzzle will be in the dog's line of vision. The muzzle's circumference must be larger than your dog's \"nose circumference.\" We recommend between one and three inches larger than your dog's measurement. If the muzzle is the exact same size as your dog's nose, the dog won't be able to pant.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"AquaTop Nano Aquarium Digital Heater with LED D1HT 50W\" COL feature VAL \"Single LED Display Temperature adjust 63F-94F.

You can set the light timer to one, five, or ten minutes, and the sensor itself may be adjusted to give you more or less sensitivity (so it doesn't light up every time a car drives by).

You can also turn the light on and off at will via the manual override that mounts to an existing indoor switch.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Sunny Health &amp; Fitness SF-E902 Air Walk Trainer Elliptical Machine Glider w/ LCD Monitor\" COL feature VAL \"<span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Full body toning via a comfortable, no impact cardio workout             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Abdominal pad provides comfort and support             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Completely smooth and quiet             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Built-in fitness programs a fun, yet challenging workout             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 LCD Computer displays: time, count, total distance, and calories             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Max user weight: 220lbs             </span> <span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary\">                 Stride Length: 30 in             </span>\" COL description VAL \"Sunny Health & Fitness SF-E902 Air Walk Trainer provides an aerobic workout, giving you all the benefits of stretching, walking, running, cross-country, skiing and aerobic dancing without jarring impacts or damaging movements to your body.

The 5-1/2-inch hand-honed blade on this knife features a sharp curve near the bolster and a straight cutting edge. The blade is slim, narrow, and flexible for ease in removing bones, particularly from chicken and other poultry. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell</i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines. Four Star knives were designed and developed in close cooperation with renowned professional chefs. The result was a fully forged knife with a unique molded handle. The Four Star line contains knives for all tasks, and includes the following open stock knife types: parer, bread, peeling, sandwich, utility, carving, chefs, granton edge slicer, santoku, and others. Four Star knives are also available in a range of block sets and gift sets. <td> </tr> </table> <P> <B>A Higher Standard in Knife Construction</B><P> Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of exclusive-formula, high-carbon, no-stain steel under the all-new Sigmaforge standard. As a result, Four Star knives have improved quality consistency, lasting sharpness, and perfect geometry. Sigmaforge one-piece construction also provides high precision and improved stability of the blade and steel structure, thus improving cutting-edge retention for lasting sharpness. In addition, Four Star knives use J.A. Henckels Friodur ice hardening for corrosion resistance, a process that also contributes to cutting-edge retention. <P> <center> <img src=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-twinselect-forging.jpg align=\"center\"></center> <p clear=left> <B>It's All in The Grip:</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar-handle.jpg </td> <td> The Four Star series features high impact polypropylene handles that are permanently bonded to the knife blades without any gaps.

Its beautiful cabinet, constructed of solid beechwood and furniture grade beech veneer, contains separate motors that allow you to grind and flake simultaneously or independently. Included with the KoMo Duett is a handmade ceramic bowl with a cool, smooth surface that complements the mill's warm finish. Oats are a naturally soft grain and more of our customers roll oats than any other grain in their Duett&mdash;but many other grains including wheat, rye, barley and millet can be flaked too, with a little preparation. If you want the full range of capability from grinder to flaker, the KoMo Duett offers significant savings compared to buying a mill and a flaker separately. The grinder side will grind hard or soft wheat, oat groats (dehulled oats), rice, triticale, kamut, spelt, buckwheat, barley, rye, millet, teff, quinoa, amaranth, sorghum and dent (field) corn. It will also grind lentils, dry beans (pinto, red, garbanzo, kidney &amp; more), and dried, non-oily spices. It isn't suitable for herbs, oilseeds like flax or sesame, popcorn, or fibrous materials. Capacity of the grinder hopper is 2 lb., 10 oz. The 600 watt motor of the Duett 200 produces 10-11 ounces per minute for bread flour texture. The KoMo Duett has precisely fitted corundum-ceramic burrs that are adjustable to grind to any texture you choose, from exceedingly fine flour to coarse meal (just cracked if you wish). All by simply rotating the hopper to align with your choice on the front texture setting scale. The flaker has a 6.4 oz. hopper and its 140 watt motor flakes 2.8 to 3.5 oz. of oats per minute. Flake thickness is adjustable from .3mm to .65mm. The Duett's flaker is perfect for rolling all softer grains like oat groats. As with all KoMo grinders, cleanup is minimal and easy and access to the milling chamber takes just a moment and requires no tools.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9974140631300773}

Trolley Car Not Included Nickel Silver rail with Gray roadbed E-Z track system--snaps together, stays together on floors, tables and carpets No nails, screws or special tools needed Modeled from AAR track engineering dimensions Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track&#039;. Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;In.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case,   Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. DO NOT USE STEEL WOOL TO CLEAN YOUR TRACK. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition.   Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended.\" COL description VAL \"Product Information Nickel silver track and gray roadbed Featuring our electronic auto-reversing E-Z Track(c), this track set is the perfect solution for point-to-point passenger and freight transit on your layout.

The Wusthof Classic Ikon 7inch fillet will easily clean and bone your favorite catch. The fillet knife comes with a leather sheath so it can be used on the lake as well as the kitchen. Located in The Cutlery Capital of the World, Solingen Germany, the Wusthof factory history goes back as far as 1814 when the company was listed with the Duchy of Berg. To this day, the company remains family owned. Throughout its history, Wusthof has focused almost solely on the manufacturing of forged knives for the professional chef and home cooking enthusiast. A considerable number of separate manufacturing steps are required to complete each precision forged knife. Each step is performed to exacting standards by skilled German workers aided by the most modern, computer guided equipment. Some of our precise steps are done robotically and utilize the same machinery that are used to produce very well known Swiss Watches. It is this balance of German technology and old world hand craftsmanship that is the secret of how each Wusthof knife is created. Known the world-over for its unique and uncompromising quality, Wusthof uses a special blend of German steel through out the whole length of the knife. The ingredients of this steel are proudly etched on each blade. Wusthof not only uses the best materials to make a fine knife, but it is also crucial that each blade is precisely tempered. This tempering allows the knife to hold its edge for an extremely long time, yet still be able to be maintained in your home kitchen with out the need to be sent away for maintenance. Our unique compound angle is not seen in many knives. This angle tapers from the spine of the knife to the edge to allow for a sturdy, yet extremely sharp edge while it also tapers from the bolster to the tip to give the knife strength as well as flexibility.\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9932811299991622}

Designed to provide protective barrier around a water bottle, Crinkits give your dog a durable, interactive toy they wont want to put down. Use the Crinkit as treat dispenser by putting a smaller 8oz or 12 oz water bottle inside the Crinkit, which allows room for a treat on the end where you in insert the bottle. The Crinkit floats and is easy to clean. Most empty 16oz water bottles fit into a Crinkit. Securing the cap tightly back onto the empty bottle allows the bottle to slide in easier. Put a little soap and water over the empty water bottle to help with inserting or taking out the bottle.

Relative humidity is a crucial factor in weather analysis and forecasting and human comfort. The data are also crucial to the safe storage of many products and instruments.  <br />  <br /> This purely mechanical instrument has been a prized product of the Fischer Precision Instrument Company for more than 60 years. It has no electronic components. The sensor element is human hair whose length is sensitive to the humidity in the air. For a given tension on the fiber bundle, the length increases with increasing relative humidity. Changes in its length are then magnified with precision gears to display the relative humidity of the air.  <br />  <br /> Installation: Relative humidity is closely correlated to and dependent upon air temperature, so it provides best data when not exposed to rapidly changing temperatures. For the best measure of the humidity, avoid placing the instrument in direct sunlight or in line with strong breezes. Locate the instrument in a place that best represents the average temperature of the local environment. Avoid outside walls that might be cooler than average, and avoid direct exposure to heat sources that would be warmer than average.  <br />  <br /> Healthy room environment: It is often considered that 40% to 60% is a healthy and comfortable relative humidity range, and with a hygrometer showing the actual value you may find that added moisture in the winter would be beneficial.\"", "right": "COL title VAL \"BBQ Grill Screen For Infrared Searing Grill Burner Bull Fits Most Models Grills OEM 20501\" COL feature VAL \"11 1/4\" x 5 1/4\" For Bull BBQ Grill Only It will not fit any other brands\" COL description VAL \"BBQ Grill replacement partBBQ GrillScreen For Infrared Searing Grill For Bull Models: Angus 4762847629 Brahma 5756857569Outlaw 2603826039 Lonestar Select 8704887049 7 Burner Premium 1824818249Grills OEM 20501\"", "match": "1", "match_confidence": 0.9876400801786767}

Each rubber stamp begins as an artists drawing. Much of the text is created with computer graphic software. The artwork is then reproduced on a magnesium plate. From this plate a matrix board mold is created. The stamp gum is vulcanized or cooked in the mold at 325 degrees under enormous pressure to form the rubber stamp die. The rubber is then affixed to a special cushion then carefully cut out. The cushioned die is then mounted onto a white maple block which is indexed with a clear vinyl label. - Stamps by Impression - \"Craft Made in Small Batches since 1986\" Stamps by Impression was born from my father's love for his wife and family.

This model comes in gray, but it's also available in white. Studies show that light is the #1 deterrent to crime, and Heath Zenith's intelligent motion lighting fixtures help give the appearance of a startled homeowner turning on the lights to investigate what's going on outside. They also provide convenient illumination when you need it most, whether you're working outside at night or needing to see the steps more clearly to avoid a fall. Lights are activated when motion is detected, so there's no need to waste electricity by leaving the lights on all night. You can choose between three auto modes&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;1, 5, or 10 minutes of illumination after motion triggers the light. However, when constant light is needed, this motion-activated light has a manual override mode that allows it to function as switch-controlled light for constant on, dusk-to-dawn lighting. Heath Zenith uses superior pulse-count motion detection technology, which prevents false triggering by reading heat and movement in pulses as opposed to single occurrences. As a result, only substantial motion is detected, such as humans and animals. In addition to being Energy Star certified, this model meets California's Title-24 energy efficiency standards for residential and commercial buildings.

They stay level, even after years of high heat exposure, and theyre accompanied by our U-shaped nonstick roasting rack, turkey lifters, and injection baster! If youve never tried slow-roasted foods, nows the time to take the time. Prepare a hassle-free roast turkey with this Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick roaster, which offers convenience and quality that disposable aluminum pans can't match. Constructed of heavy-gauge hard-anodized aluminum, the pan heats evenly and consistently while in the oven, delivering a golden brown bird on the outside that tastes moist and juicy on the inside. The pan's nonstick surface ensures that the turkey will release cleanly, making it easy to collect juices and bits for gravy. The roaster includes a nonstick rack--which allows heat to circulate underneath the turkey--as well as a bulb baster with an injector tip and two stainless-steel turkey lifters. When it's time to remove the bird from the oven, simply lift the rack out of the roasting pan, then use the lifters to move the turkey to the serving platter. The pan measures 16 by 4 by 13 inches (W x H x D) and is oven-safe to 450 degrees F.

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM \"tent cities\" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, Eurekas new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition. For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Womens Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian. <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering. \"", "right": "COL title VAL \"Kodiak Canvas Flex-Bow Deluxe 8-Person Tent\" COL feature VAL \"Canvas Made with Hydra-Shield, 100% cotton duck canvas that is durable, watertight and breathable Spacious 6'6\" ceiling height provides walk-around comfort Two large D-shaped doors (front and back) with #10 YKK zippers Four large windows with no-see-um mesh Two funnel-flow vents help improve air flow and temperature management Made with Hydra-Shield, 100% cotton duck canvas that is durable, watertight and breathable Spacious 6'6\" ceiling height provides walk-around comfort.

The Flex-Bow tent is made of a superior, marine-grade, 100-percent cotton duck Hydra-Shield canvas. The custom-woven, treated canvas is ideal for tents, as the double-fill design is strong and durable, while the silicone, dry-finish treatment is watertight, breathable, and durable. As a result, campers will stay comfortable and dry even in a downpour. Unlike synthetic fabrics or canvas with a paraffin- or oil-based treatment, Kodiak's canvas allows water vapor to escape, minimizing condensation, humidity, and mugginess. Plus, you'll rarely--if ever--have to retreat Kodiak canvas. The Flex-Bow frame is every bit as strong, with 1-inch galvanized steel tubing and 3/8-inch Flex-Bow spring steel rods keeping the tent taut at all times. To further improve ventilation, the tent includes two funnel-flow vents that circulate air and assist with temperature management. And campers won't feel claustrophobic thanks to the tent's spacious 6-foot 6-inch ceiling height, two large D-shaped doors (front and back), and four large windows, all covered with no-see-um mesh.

WaterDog senses your dog's approach, and automatically dispenses a cool, clean stream of fresh drinking water. Smart sonar sensing technology triggers the WaterDog to turn the water on when your pet comes within 3 feet (1 meter), and turns it off when your pet leaves. You'll never have to worry about what your dog's been drinking again. Constructed of durable, high-quality UV resistant materials, the WaterDog has been designed to provide many years of reliable service. The WaterDog's hose has a metal covering to protect it from chewing and to reflect heat to help keep the water cool, even on bright sunny days. The WaterDog is an automatic drinking fountain that is designed to give your pet direct access to fresh clean water, at any time. A sonar-based proximity sensor triggers the WaterDog to turn the water on when your pet comes within three feet (one meter), and turns it off when your pet leaves. Dogs quickly learn that they can always get a drink from the WaterDog. This greatly reduces the risk of your dog becoming dehydrated on a hot day, or developing disease from a contaminated water bowl.

To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track.W hen the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive.A dd the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically.D o not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains.

KitchenAid has introduced a new member of the stand mixer family, known as the Artisan mixer. It has a tilting head, like the KSM90, but it has a larger 5 qt. capacity bowl. It also gives you more oomph, as in 325 watts of cookie dough busting power. What's not to love? If you've been considering a stand mixer, this may be the perfect \"starter model\" for you. KitchenAid's Artisan stand mixer is a substantial piece of equipment: 325 watts of mixing power make child's play of creaming butter, kneading dough, and whipping cream. The kid in you will appreciate how quick and easy it is to mix up a batch of cookie dough. This model comes with three attachments: a flat beater for making batter, meat loaf, and all textures in-between; a wire whip for egg whites, mayonnaise, and more air-infused creations; and a hook for mixing and kneading yeast doughs. All three are solidly constructed and easily secured to the beater shaft with a simple twist. This model also includes a pouring shield for guiding ingredients to their proper destination, and the bowl itself locks tight to the base. Standing about 15 inches high, jutting out a foot, and weighing more than a grown woman's bowling ball, this stand mixer isn't the sort of appliance you'll wipe down and put away.

Measures 6-1/2 by 5 by 4-Inches Since the inception of Fratelli Guzzini in 1912, innovation has been at the very core of every product design. Inspired by his personal experiences at home and abroad, Enrico Guzzini initially set out to relaunch an ancient craft by producing elegant ox horn items. Later, a younger Guzzini generation began to craft household items from Plexiglas. Reaching its next milestone in the 1960s, Raimondo Guzzini began to create a more open approach to business with the introduction of moulded acrylics while focusing on creative design concepts. By the 1980s Fratelli Guzzini began to shape into the company that it is known for today by introducing color and a creative incorporation of various materials like porcelain and glass. With many awards from all over the world, some of Guzzinis collections are showcased at the Museum of Modern Art in New York as well as the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Guzzini strives for the ideal combination of practicality and aesthetic appeal while a research team carefully considers the environmental cost.

Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge.

Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary. This 9-1/4-inch square baker, crafted from commercial-grade  stoneware with Le Creuset's poterie glaze, cooks up a mean hot dish and  looks good doing it. Coated inside and out with the company's signature  enamel, the dish doesn't absorb moisture and resists chips, nicks,  stains, and odors. It's oven-safe to 500 degrees F and can also go in  the freezer, refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. It even looks  good at the table.

CupriSorb?? will remove copper more rapidly and efficiently than carbon and is thus ideal for emergency copper removal. It extracts all types of copper from water and, if in continuous use, from the gravel/substrate bed as well. CupriSorb? will allow maintenance of invertebrates in copper-treated tanks by removing copper leaching from substrates. This product is sold by volume. Cited weight is minimal weight.DIRECTIONS: Use 500 mL for every 1,200?L (300 gallons*) to remove up to 15,000 mg (12 ppm) of copper. For best results, CupriSorb? should be placed so as to maximize the flow of water through it. To remove undetectable substrate leaching copper keep CupriSorb? in use for at least 2 weeks after copper tests report no copper. Use in a canister filter, chemical filtration module, box filter, or any high flow area of a trickle filter. Exhaustion is indicated by a pronounced discoloration of the beads to a deep blue black color. Use MultiTest: Copper? to monitor copper. When exhausted, CupriSorb? may be discarded or regenerated. REGENERATION: Soak in a non-metal container with 2 cups of water and 1?2 cup of muriatic acid (available with pool supplies: PAY HEED TO WARNINGS on acid container!). This is best done outside and away from children. Soak for 1 hour, rinse well. Repeat as required to restore the original color. Rinse well, add sodium bicarbonate until foaming stops, and rinse again. CupriSorb? is now ready for reuse. If original color cannot be restored after several acid washes, proceed with rinses and bicarbonate step, then regenerate as HyperSorb? or Purigen?. i500 mL / 17 fl. oz.
