The ChefsChoice Diamond Hone EdgeSelect Plus Model 120 requires no sharpening oils or liquids. Engineered and assembled in the USA. It may seem like a contradiction, but sharp knives are the safest. With a clean edge, a knife is more predictable and easier to control. If you've purchased a top-of-the-line knife, maintaining the quality of the blade ensures maximum value from your investment. This Chef's Choice knife sharpener performs professional-quality sharpening on any knife, from gourmet knives to hunting knives--even serrated knives can be sharpened with this machine. For top-quality edges, there are two sharpening and honing stages, which use 100 percent diamond abrasives, and a final polishing stage. Each stage uses precision angle guides to create a unique Trizor-Plus edge for maximum sharpness and durability, while a magnetic pad collects residue so the machine is easy to clean and maintain. While a sharp knife is indeed a safe knife, it's wise to use caution with your newly sharpened knives, as they'll be sharper than you expect. <it>--Laura Cuthbert</it><P> <B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr> <td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/smallappliances/chefschoice-120-serrate.gif </td> <td> For all fine-edge knives, and even serrated knives (as demonstrated in the image), the Chef's Choice 120 three-stage diamond hone professional sharpener lets you select the edge to match the need.

The featherboards slide into miter-gauge slots in the router table or fence, and are locked in place by tightening a pair of knobs.

Just how does it work? Well, a powerful piston pump removes the air from the patented storage bags and custom containers, then seals them tight. FoodSaver bags have 3 layers of material and special channels so that all the air is suctioned out and can't get trapped in pockets. The bag's outer layer of nylon keeps air from re-entering and spoiling your food. This machine is easy to use and you're certain to find it is a great way to maximize your food's freshness as well as helping your prepare meals ahead, pack for trips and so on. Even first-time users will quickly get the hang of this nifty device. By vacuuming air out of food storage bags, the food inside stays fresher longer--years longer, in many cases. After food is placed in a bag, the edge is laid along the Teflon coated sealing strip and the lid closed. Two hands are required to press down on the top. A choice of two seal times, long and short, ensure that the FoodSavers nylon piston pump vacuums out as much air as desired: longer for wet foods, such as meats, and shorter for dry foods, such as pasta. The machine then creates a wide, tight seal. <P> FoodSavers patented dual-layer bags, made of UV-protective and FDA-approved materials, can be frozen (and prevent freezer burn on foods), microwaved, and boiled. The kit includes three quart-size and two gallon-size bags, along with an 11-inch-by-10-foot roll that can be cut with the built-in cutter to customized lengths and sealed with the Seal Only setting. An accessory port allows the included 30-inch hose to be attached in order to vacuum seal homemade foods in jars, cans, and bottles, or in the kits round, 3/4-quart canister. A how-to video takes away all the guesswork.

The petal-shaped pans add a fresh and personal touch; decorate with edible or marzipan flowers for added effect. <P>Since the pans come in four different sizes and are in a nonstandard petal shape, a baking and serving chart on the packaging helps determine the appropriate baking time and amount of batter required for each pan, as well as the quantity of batter and icing needed overall. Decorating ideas are included on the packaging as well. The 2-inch deep pans, deeper than standard cake pans, ensure cake sides are straight and smooth for easy icing.

COL description VAL "This Perma-SHIELD coated blade gives new life to underpowered saws and produces smooth crosscuts in hardwoods, softwoods and moldings. Coated blades pull 1/3 less on the saw, which translates into 33% more cutting power. Thin kerf blades remove less material than standard carbide blades, thus requiring less horsepower to produce equally good results.

This means it provides you with smoother cuts, and it can handle fast feed rates. It's ideal for crosscutting hard- or softwoods that are 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thick, and it also provides good results when cutting plywood and chipboard or when ripping wood. The blade can also handle laminate, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.090 kerf. Plus, because this thin-kerf blade removes less material than standard carbide blades, it wastes less material and requires less horsepower to produce smooth, clean results. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This crosscutting saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide "crosscut blend." Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo. With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money. <b>Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat Buildup</b><br>Built to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp. As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or "pitch" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

It provides useful practice of addition and multiplication facts. It requires strategizing to decide how to play on each turn. That's the good news. The bad news is that the rules are rather difficult to figure out, even for an adult. But keep trying--it's a rewarding and educational game after all. Polygon uses numbered tiles that are placed on the game board in ways that achieve a score for each turn. You can play tiles in several ways so you have to add (and sometimes multiply, too) on each turn, as well as at the end of the game. Polygon is a subtle way to practice those math facts painlessly, so it's a good choice for elementary age kids from third through fifth grades. <I>--Marcie Bovetz</I>" 0.9219921007855413

Includes fascimiles of real U.S. money plus tips that parents and teachers can use to connect Moneywise play with the real world. For two players. Created by a volunteer math aide in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Moneywise Kids contains two simple, fun games that will help kids understand how money works, in terms of dollar value and spending power. In the first game, Bill Maker, kids take turns rolling the dice and earning dollars that are commensurate with the numbers that come up: roll a 2 and a 6, for instance, and you get $8. As they accrue wealth with each turn, players exchange smaller bills for larger ones until someone winds up with $100. In the second game, Bill Breaker, each player starts with $100 and earns more money with each turn, but players must also draw "moneywise markers"--bills for such real-life expenses as food, medical care, and taxes--and make payments along the way. And watch out for those hard-luck chips that mean big bills. The player who collects all six markers and still has $100 in savings is the winner. The game is lively and only lightly competitive, with an accent on grasping the mysteries of dollars and cents. <I>--Tom Keogh</I>" 0.952353049558644

Show your skills as you dunk over your opponents. Made of lightweight foam, the multi-colored basketball measures 4in. in diameter and is safe to use indoors. Since the hoop is lightweight and uses a screwless door mount, this set can be moved from door-to-door, stored when needed or taken anywhere you go. All you need is a door to experience great basketball action. Includes a breakaway rim, backboard, net and 4in. foam basketball. Recommended for children 5 years of age and older. Don't let a little rainy weather break up those backyard basketball games. If your little hoopsters have the indoor blues, help them play their favorite sport--and expend some of their boundless energy--with the Poof Breakaway Hoop Set.

A revolutionairy combination of advanced filter media and an encapsulated ion particle charging chamber makes it possible for the Blueaur air purification system to achieve better results than either technology alone. Our patented HEPASilent filter technology is proven effective at capturing 99.97% of the tiniest 0.1 micron particles. The quietest unit in the industry, Blueair's low-density filter clean larger volumes of air more quietly than any other unit in the industry. Hence the name HEPASilent(r) a Blueair Exclusive. Bacteria-resistant filters, Blueair's filters are made of bacteria-resistant polypropylene. Because polypropylene is waterproof, the filters naturally reist contamination from bacteria, viruses and mold without chemical additives or washes. And the filters only need replacement every six months, a process that takes under 30 seconds. The Blueair 501 is for room sizes up to 679 square feet.10 year limted warranty, Award-winning Swedish design For rooms up to 679 square feet, this air purification system features two-stage HEPASilent technology that captures 99.97-percent of 0.1 micron particles, including allergy-provoking pollen grains, dust mites, mold spores, and pet dander particles. The unit is ideal for people living with allergies, asthma, or other respiratory conditions, or for anyone who wants cleaner, more breathable air. Particles that a HEPA filter alone might miss are captured with an electrostatic charge. HEPASilent technology moves particles through an enclosed ion chamber, which attaches a charge to the particle itself. Charged particles cling more easily to the filter media, resulting in higher filter efficiency overall. Because most electrostatic air cleaners charge the filter media itself, the charge dissipates over time and renders the filter less efficient. By constantly charging incoming particles, instead of the filter, HEPASilent technology keeps on working effectively. The air purifier's nontoxic polypropylene filter contains millions of ultra-thin fibers that trap tiny particles as they pass through the pleats. One of the least harmful plastics for human health and the environment, polypropylene works without outgassing or shedding irritating microscopic fibers into the air. Because polypropylene is waterproof, the filter resists contamination from bacteria, viruses, and mold naturally, without chemical additives. And as used filters are discarded and decompose, the filter media converts into harmless carbon dioxide and water. Not only does the unit clean air with filters, it&#146;s HEPASilent filter technology also allows for extremely quiet operation. On the lowest setting, the unit emits no more sound than a desktop computer. With its HEPASilent filter technology, particles are trapped with both mechanical and electrostatic filters so that in combination, the two filters create a filter system through which air flows freely and the fan doesn't have to work so hard. The unit's design is also geared towards quiet operation with its noise-muffling steel housing. Not only quiet, but the air purifier is energy efficient as well, costing about the same amount to clean indoor air as it does to power a light bulb--15 watts on low to 95 watts on high. The air purifier operates efficiently, quietly, as well as inoffensively. Instead of discharging a windy stream of filtered air, the unit diffuses air gently through an area six times greater than the average air cleaner. Its SurroundAir system achieves peak performance without annoying drafts by drawing in dirty air from the sides and bottom, moving it through a less dense filter media, and releasing clean, filtered air from the sides and top. Operating on its lowest setting, the system produces virtually no noticeable draft, while still providing an exceptional air exchange rate. The air purifier features a sleek, contemporary, Swedish design and is easy to use and maintain. Simply plug it in, select the speed setting, and it is ready to go, with a bright blue power "on" light to show that it's working. The grilles and powder-coated steel exterior are easy to wipe clean, and when the filter needs to be replaced (twice yearly), just open the lid, lift out the old filters, and drop the new ones in. This quiet, efficient, easy-to-use air purifier measures 26 by 20 by 13 inches and carries a 10-year warranty. <i>--Catie Unger</i>" 0.9705485187078967

Follow the sequence and take turns adding food cards to the pot. First potatoes, then tomatoes, and so on. Out of the right ingredient? Pass your turn with the dash-of-salt card or dare to bluff. You'll have to sneak to get rid of your stone cards - slip one into the pot and double your risk. Be the first to play all your cards and win. When the game is over, follow Sally's Stoneless Stone Soup recipe to cook up a real pot of soup!" Your cauldron bubbleth over. The broth needs onion and sausage, but you're stuck with a mittful of cabbage and peas. What to do? Simmer down; if you're between a rock and a hard place, you'll just have to bluff your way through this recipe. And with Stone Soup, Gamewright's game du jour, the house special is deception, sneakiness, and crafty culinary card-play. Based loosely on the old folktale whereby reluctant villagers were enticed to enhance a "delicious soup of water and stones" by adding "just one more vegetable," Stone Soup consists of a 54-card ingredient deck dealt out and composing a consomm&eacute; that must be assembled--in specific ingredient order--by placing cards face-down into the pot and hoping that no one calls a bluff. Oh, sure, it's delicious when tomatoes are called for and you have two tomato cards, but what do you do with your Stone cards except hope to sneak them in, face-down, by announcing "Here are four tomatoes!" Get busted and the penalty is severe: take all cards in the pot. Ditch 'em all, either by evading challenges to discards, or by completely honest card-play, and the only thing missing from your victory bouillon is salt and pebble... uh, pepper. <I>--Tony Mason</I>" 0.9826909042463315

He earned eleven NBA All-Star Game appearances and was named the All-Star MVP in 1991.

The team averaged an Olympic record 117.3 points a game and won games by an average of 43.8 points.

The fish you bought may already carry a disease. Disease is often difficult to detect, particularly in its early stages. Treat bacterial infections in your fish and reduce the risk of spreading illness to other fish with API MELAFIX Freshwater Fish Bacterial Infection Remedy. Bacterial diseases are caused mostly by dirty aquarium conditions and the addition of infected fish. Fish that are injured and have open wounds are especially susceptible, even in seemingly clean tanks. Bacterial infections, like fin and tail rot, eye cloud, pop eye, body slime and mouth fungus destroy tissue and other organs, and if left untreated, can cause death. API MELAFIX Freshwater Fish Bacterial Infection Remedy is an all-natural antibacterial treatment that heals open wounds, treats bacterial infections and promotes re-growth of damaged fins and tissue, usually within a week. Just add 5 ml per 10 gallons of aquarium water. It will not adversely affect the biological filter, alter the pH or discolor the water. For effective treatment, dose infected fish daily for 7 days, and continue afterward if necessary. Dose new fish daily for 3 days. Remove activated carbon from filter before use, if possible. With API Aquarium products, its easy to keep a beautiful saltwater, freshwater or reef aquarium. For over 50 years, API has been creating innovative, research-driven solutions that make it easier to care for your fish and aquarium. API Aquarium Treatment Supplies are designed to work in conjunction with each other to provide best results to control algae, promote healthy bacterial growth and help control and cure fish diseases and conditions such as ich and fin rot. They work to provide a safe, hospitable environment for fish such as tropical community fish, cichlids, goldfish and more.

A built-in antenna system receives signals from the WWVB radio transmitter in Fort Collins, Colorado, which is in turn regulated by the atomic clock. Once you install the battery and choose one of four U.S. time zones, the clock automatically sets to the accurate time in hours, minutes, and secods, and continues to adjust itself six times daily. This low-maintenance clock even automatically adjusts for daylight savings time, so you never need to remember to spring ahead or fall back. As an additional perk, the clock features in the lower left area of the face a hygrometer that measures the percentage of relative humidity in the air. The lower right has an analog thermometer that reports the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. This radio-controlled clock is covered by a 1-year warranty and runs on one AA battery (not included). <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>" 0.5643686053167538

The side handles supports the basket's shape, rather than allowing it to open flat upon lifting. Capacity for more to steam. Segments fold inward for compact storage It's less what it includes than what it lacks that makes this Norpro vegetable steamer a cut above your average steamer insert. Without a bothersome center post, there is plenty of unobstructed room to steam entire heads of broccoli or cauliflower or full-length cobs of corn--and finished vegetables are easier to remove with a spoon or a spatula as denser veggies keep steaming. No need to slice carrots or pole beans beforehand--just plop them whole into the basket, which expands from 7 to 10&nbsp;inches, depending on the size of the pot you set it&nbsp;in. The three-pronged base provides stability equal to models with center posts, but instead of one central handle there are two ring-style side handles. This is another improvement, as you don't need to reach into the middle of the steaming-hot food to remove the basket, and using the side handles supports the basket's shape rather than allowing its "petals" to pop open flat upon lifting.

Olson</i> <strong><font color="#cc6600"><big>Five Tips for Buying Door Hardware</big></font></strong><br>Theres nothing that enhances style and function quite like new door hardware. Its the first thing that catches the eye at the front door, and it feels good in hand throughout the home. Here are five tips to simplify the buying process. <font color="434242"><b>What are the different types of door hardware?</b></font color="434242"><br><ul><b>Entry</b> hardware installs on exterior doors, and includes knobs or handlesets (handle with deadbolt) that lock with keys or touch pads from the outside and turnbuttons from inside. A deadbolt lock optimizes security.<br> <b>Privacy</b> hardware is designed for bedrooms and bathrooms, locking with turnbuttons and not requiring keys.<br> <b>Passage</b> knobs and levers are designed for hallway doors, laundry rooms and closet doors that latch but dont lock.<br> <b>Dummy</b> knobs and levers are decorative hardware pieces designed for pantry doors or other doors that only require a pull to open, with no latch or lock.</ul> <font color="434242"><b>What safety features are available? </b></font color="434242"><br> The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) sets different grades for door hardware, such as Grade 1 (basic), Grade 2 (intermediate), and Grade 3 (highest). These days, with more and more intruders using "bump keys"--a key that can open almost any lock--or locksmith tools once intended only to resolve accidental lockouts, many manufacturers offer bump-resistant cylinders. <font color="434242"><b>Will it fit my door?</b></font color="434242"><br><ul><li>Standard doors are either 1-3/8 or 1-3/4 inches thick, with most hardware designed to adjust for either. Extension kits are available for thicker doors.<table align=right width=250 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td align="center"> <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/backset_large.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/backset_small.jpg" border=0 align=top></a><br><small><i><b> <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/backset_large.jpg" TARGET="_blank" onclick=""window.open(this.href,hull,'width=674,height=420'); return false;">View larger</a></b></i></small> </td> </tr> </table> <li>Most hardware is interchangeable, only requiring that the <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/backset_large.jpg" TARGET="_blank" onclick=""window.open(this.href,hull,'width=674,height=420'); return false;">backset</a> (the distance from the edge of the door to the center of the knob or lock, usually 2-3/8 or 2-3/4 inches) matches the hole(s) in the door so that the latch or bolt throws properly. Some hardware sets adjust for both backset lengths. <li>Levers come in both left- and right-handed models. To determine the appropriate handing, look at the doors hinges from outside the door. If the hinges are on the left, youll need a left-handed lever. If the hinges are on the right, you need a right-handed lever.</ul> <font color="434242"><b>Can I install it myself?</b></font color="434242"><br>Most door hardware, including keypads and deadbolts, installs in under an hour with only a Philips screwdriver. Most keypads are powered by batteries, so no wiring is required. Handlesets sometimes require a drill. If the door or doorframe is not predrilled, door hardware usually comes with a paper template to mark holes for drilling and sawing with common spade bits and hole saws. Specialized tool sets also are available for door-hardware installation. If you want to use one key on multiple entry handles or deadbolts, you will need a locksmith to "re-key" all the locks to the same key. This should be done before installation and only will work if all the hardware comes from the same manufacturer. <font color="434242"><b>What cool hardware features are available nowadays?</b></font color="434242"><br>Keypad locks and deadbolts let you add and delete numerous user codes as needed, providing family members, neighbors, baby- or pet-sitters with easy-to-remember codes. Cool for parents and great for keeping kids out of cleaning closets and utility rooms, some keypads have auto-lock mechanisms that lock after a few seconds in case you forget.<br>Once used only for government applications (as depicted in high-tech spy movies), biometric keyless entry systems, which scan dozens of different fingerprints for easy access, also are growing in popularity."

It is much stronger than competing products and is safer too. Some competing products contain toxic formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is more toxic than ammonia, and if too much is used, the results can be disastrous. Ammonia Detox is safe, even when overdosed. It neutralizes ammonia, chlorine and chloramine, instantly preparing tap water for immediate addition to the aquarium. Unlike some similar products, Ammonia Detox is even safe for sensitive hard and soft corals, anemones and other invertebrates, as well as freshwater and marine fish and plants. Use when preparing tap water for new aquariums, making water changes, or adding water to make up for evaporation. Ammonia Detox is safe to use directly in all freshwater and marine aquariums, including coral mini-reefs and also water gardens to neutralize toxic ammonia, as well. If the bacteria bed of an aquarium is accidentally killed by overuse of antibiotics, or other factors, Ammonia Detox will bind toxic ammonia, providing time to relocate the fish and invertebrates or to obtain other filtration media. In cases where too many fish are added too quickly, Ammonia Detox will bind ammonia until the existing bacteria multiply sufficiently to handle the ammonia. Ammonia Detox is also valuable for binding nitrites in fry rearing systems, where filtration cannot be used."

The following is a brief summary of each glove's characteristics:<br> <ul> <li><b>Catcher:</b> No finger channels, with heavy palm padding and overall reinforcements to reduce the sting of repeatedly catching pitchers' throws <li><b>First Base:</b> Also lacks finger channels, but with less padding that a catcher's mitt, with added length to help catch infield throws and shallow pocket, enabling quick ball retrieval <li><b>Infield:</b> Five-fingered glove has shallow pocket for fast ball retrieval, with nine- to 10-inch youth sizes and 10.5- to 11.5-inch adult sizes, and softball infield gloves having a deeper pocket to accept the larger ball<br> <ul> <li><i>Second base</i> players require smaller gloves to balance control with the need to make quick throws <li><i>Shortstops</i> use a mid-sized glove for ground balls and quick throws <li><i>Third base</i> players need a larger glove for maximum catching power </ul> <li><b>Outfield:</b> Glove is longer to provide extended reach, with a deep pocket to handle high-lofting balls, and sizes range from 12 inches and up for adults and 11 inches for youth players <li><b>Softball Gloves:</b> The characteristics, by position, of softball gloves are typically similar to their baseball counterparts, with softball gloves having more length and deeper pockets to handle the larger ball </ul> <b><font color=CC6600>Anatomy of a Glove</font></b><br> Gloves are designed to perform a relatively simple task--catch a ball. The quality of materials and craftsmanship that can go into a building a glove, however, can be surprising. Below is an overview of a glove's components and how each helps optimize your defensive game:<br> <ul> <li><b>Pocket:</b> Pocket depth is determined by player position, with shallower pockets helping infielders quickly retrieve and throw the ball, and outfielders' pocket depth aiding in capturing a ball on the fly. Softball players also need deeper pockets to catch the larger ball. <li><b>Webbing:</b> The preferred webbing pattern is partly determined by field position and partly by player preference. Generally, open webbing helps infielders quickly retrieve the ball, closed or tightly woven webbing gives outfielders and third basemen extra support, and closed webbing allows pitchers to hide the ball from the batter. <li><b>Backs:</b> The back of a glove, or the part that goes across the top of your hand, can either be closed or open, which is largely a matter of player preference. Some infielders find an open back to be more flexible and forgiving, while outfielders may like a closed back with finger hole for added support. <li><b>Wrist Adjustment:</b> Some gloves include fit systems, or wrist adjustments, to help keep the glove tightly affixed to a player's hand. The most popular closures are buckles, D-rings, lacing, and Velcro. <li><b>Padding:</b> How padded a glove's pocket is depends on position, with catcher being the most heavily padded. In recent years, many manufacturers have begun to add padding to other position gloves to reduce "palm shock." <li><b>Materials:</b> By and large, gloves are constructed using one of three materials--leather, treated leather, or synthetic--with the differences relating to feel and durability. <ul> <li><i>Leather:</i> Most high-end gloves are made of leather, which offers optimal feel and durability, with leather quality being a significant cost driver <li><i>Treated Leather:</i> Leather material is softened and strengthened during production for quicker break-in, better durability, and lower maintenance <li><i>Synthetic:</i> A lower-cost alternative to leather that offers reduced durability and responsiveness, and is a good option for beginning players </ul> </ul> <b><font color=CC6600>Fits Like a...</font></b><br> As mentioned above, age and position are the most significant factors in selecting a proper glove size. Outfielders need larger gloves with deeper pockets for maximum "catchability," while infield gloves are smaller and have shallower pockets for optimal control and speedy ball removal. Some pitchers opt for infield gloves that are slightly larger than standard, yet small and shallow enough for rapid fielding and throwing. Most younger players will benefit from youth-sized gloves that help with control, and it's a good idea to resist the temptation to buy a larger glove the child will grow into. The tables below offer a general guideline for proper glove size by sport, position, and age. <table width="400px" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border:1px #000 solid; text-align:center;"> <tr> <td colspan="3" valign="left" style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;

Its 'sure grip' and well-balanced design combine with a soft trigger to reduce arm fatigue. And because you won&rsquo;t have to drag a hose with you as you work, you&rsquo;ll be able to drive nails better and longer, without undue stress on your arms, hands, and wrists. <b>Compact, Heavy-Duty Design Works Anywhere and Everywhere</b><br>Compact enough to work in tight, hard-to-reach areas, the IMCT Framing Nailer packs a powerful punch with heavy-duty construction that can handle tough job conditions. It shoots up to 1,200 nails on a single fuel cell and up to 4,000 nails on a full battery charge, providing a cycle rate of two to three nails per second. And because it offers tool-free depth-of-drive adjustment--no wrenches required!--you can get more done in less time. <b>Internal Combustion Linear Motor for Robust Performance</b><br>Unlike other power fastening tools, the IMCT Framing Nailer is powered by an internal combustion linear motor. In simpler terms, the nailer owes its robust performance to its motor, which is similar to an automobile's motor. Additionally, the tool ignites a fuel and air mixture to produce the energy needed to drive the motor, and ultimately, the fastener. <b>Patented Battery System for Consistency and Reliability</b><br>Another unique feature of this nailer is that it uses a patented system that requires both a fuel cell and a rechargeable battery (the fuel cell is not included). This translates to optimum consistency and reliability, whether you&rsquo;re building a deck, working with wall sheathing, or repairing a roof. It also means the IMCT Framing Nailer is entirely self-contained. The tool carries its own fuel supply and battery--along with a supply of fasteners--making it easy to bring with you from site to site. <b>Lockout Feature to Prevent Blank Firing and Wood Damage</b><br>The IMCT Framing Nailer boasts a lockout feature to prevent needless blank cycling, which can waste fuel and damage both the wood you&rsquo;re working with and the nailer's components. This feature works by ensuring that five nails will be left in the magazine when the follower reaches the lockout area. Additionally, the tool will not operate when its nail supply has less than six nails. <b>High-Visibility Magazine and Belt Hanger for Convenience</b><br>The IMCT Framing Nailer is designed to be exceptionally user friendly, with features that help keep your job running smoothly. First, the load magazine is highly visible, so it helps prevent you from running out of nails in the middle of a project. There&rsquo;s also a convenient dual-position belt hanger, so you don't have to lay the nailer on the ground or on top of a ladder, nor do you have to wedge it among rafters. And if you can't remember where you last placed your nailer, its bright orange color makes it easy to spot. <b>About the Battery Charging System</b><br>The IMCT Framing Nailer comes with a rechargeable battery and its own charging system. This charging system is the only one that will work with Paslode batteries (both round and oval). When your tool arrives, you&rsquo;ll first need to charge the battery. Batteries will generally take five minutes to two hours to recharge, depending on the amount of discharge within the battery. <b>Dimensions and Warranty Information</b><br>The IMCT Framing Nailer has a height of 14.5 inches and weighs 7.3 pounds. It comes with a one-year limited warranty on all parts, a five-year warranty on all molded nylon parts, and a 90-day limited warranty on the bumper, driver blades, O-rings, and seal rings. <b>What's in the Box</b><br>Nailer, 6.0-volt battery, charger, belt hanger, rugged plastic carrying case, safety goggles, manual, and 5/32-inch hex wrench.<br clear="all"><table align="center" width="750" cellpadding="10"><tr><td><center><br><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/content_26/Q2_2009/paslode-B0000225HU-3-sm.jpg" border="0"><br><br><font size=1><font face="Verdana"><em><b>The IMCT Framing Nailer is designed to for easy handling and reliable, professional performance.</b></em></font></center></td></tr></table><br clear="all">" COL title VAL "Grizzly G0529 Oscillating Spindle/Disc Sander, 12-Inch" COL feature VAL "We've combined the precision of an Oscillating Spindle Sander and a 12-Inch Disc Sander The Spindle Sander features 4 spindle sizes which utilize sleeves of sandpaper for easy changing availability and low cost The direct drive 1725 RPM 12-Inch Disc Sander yields excellent control without burning the work piece" COL description VAL "We've combined the precision of an Oscillating Spindle Sander and a 12" Disc Sander for the ultimate and most useful combination sander on the market today.

The 8-inch Channellock 338 Diagonal Cutting Plier uses precision machined knife and anvil style cutting edges to ensure perfect mating and superior cutting edge life. Channellock uses high carbon C1080 steel for superior performance on the job, and an electronic coating for ultimate rust prevention. It's completed by Channellock's iconic blue handle, which is both comfortable in your hand and easy to spot in your tool bag. The 338 can cut piano wire (0.063- to 0.091-inch thick), hard wire (0.047- to 0.091-inch), medium hard wire (0.047- to 0.091-inch), and soft wire (0.162-inch maximum diameter). Channellock utilizes precision-machined knife and anvil style cutting edges to ensure perfect mating and superior cutting edge life. While most manufactureres use two sharp edges that can become misaligned and lose their cutting effectiveness, Channellock's knife and anvil cutters give you proper cutting edge alignment for a clean cut every time. The edge is also laser hardened for unprecedented edge life. Founded in 1886, Channellock is a worldwide leader in the manufacture of high-quality pliers and assorted hand tools. Now run by the fifth generation of the DeArment family, Channellock tools reflect a tradition of dedication to excellence maintained for well over a century. Over the years, Channellock has obtained several patents including one in 1965 for the conical surface created on the cam side of the pliers when undercut and another in 1984 for the PermaLock fastener found in its Tongue and Groove Pliers. Channellock still manufactures more than 120 different sizes and types of pliers and hand tools at its facilities in Meadville, Pennsylvania." 0.9770664357676163

A knob adjusts the guide plate to the desired cutting thickness, and a gauge displays the setting in inches and millimeters. Three julienne blades of varying widths (1/8, 3/16, and 3/8 of an inch) snap easily into place for creating foods such as french fries.

Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global's original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives, Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty cutlery--like this 6-1/4-inch boning knife, whose stiff blade is as thick as a traditional European knife's and ideal for meat and poultry and cutting through joints. Global also dispensed with bolsters on most of its knives, although this knife has one. Most Global knives have hollow handles, but the handle on this knife is solid. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>" 0.9805620471528771

The kids' playing cards have pictures on the back to provide a clue to the correct answer. This game will be frustrating to those families not very familiar with Disney movies; we recommend it for die-hard Disney fans only. Requires three AA batteries (included). <I>--M.

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 7-inch hand-honed blade on this knife features a modest curve near the bolster and a straight cutting edge. The blade is long, slim, and flexible and is ideal for filleting fish or chicken; the thin edge allows the meat's fibers to be cleanly separated, making quick work of even the toughest tuna. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell </i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines. Four Star knives were designed and developed in close cooperation with renowned professional chefs. The result was a fully forged knife with a unique molded handle. The Four Star line contains knives for all tasks, and includes the following open stock knife types: parer, bread, peeling, sandwich, utility, carving, chefs, granton edge slicer, santoku, and others. Four Star knives are also available in a range of block sets and gift sets. <td> </tr> </table> <P> <B>A Higher Standard in Knife Construction</B><P> Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of exclusive-formula, high-carbon, no-stain steel under the all-new Sigmaforge standard. As a result, Four Star knives have improved quality consistency, lasting sharpness, and perfect geometry. Sigmaforge one-piece construction also provides high precision and improved stability of the blade and steel structure, thus improving cutting-edge retention for lasting sharpness. In addition, Four Star knives use J.A.

Unlike cast iron, which requires a pre-seasoning process, our cast aluminum griddle is non-stick coated and only a small amount of oil or butter is needed to prevent sticking. Because cast aluminum heats evenly and quickly, a low or medium heat setting is all that is needed for great results.  Overheating our griddle or heating it without food can damage the non stick surface and warp the pan.   <br/><br/> Clean the griddle with mild soap and a soft cloth after each use and never use metal utensils or abrasive cleaning products, which will scratch the nonstick surface of the pan.

As a practicing veterinarian in the 1960's Dr Ted Lafeber Sr. was treating pet birds and soon realized that most pet birds were suffering from malnutrition. Birds can not survive on millet, canary seed and sunflower seeds alone. In 1975, he created the very first pet bird pellet recipe. Initially, many people thought he was crazy, birds eat seeds, not pellets, but then they saw the results the birds eating pellets were healthier, happier and living longer. Nutritionally Balanced Good health and a long life begin with proper nutrition and Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet is formulated to provide exactly that. Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet is a high quality blend of natural ingredients like ground non-GMO corn and soybean meal. Both grains are literally grown outside Lafeber Company's front door. We also add whole egg, the world's most digestive form of protein. The different grains are mixed and essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids are added which are necessary for strong bones and brilliant feathers. Watch your feathered friend shine with the excellent nutrition found in Lafeber' s pelleted bird food. Balancing the Omega Fatty Acids increases immune function. Generally, increased immune function helps the body's ability to fight disease. Balanced Omega 3 & 6's also improves the quality of the skin. More than ever, each pelleted recipe provides excellent nutrition for your loved feathered companion. Creating the first Omega 3 & 6 balanced pet bird pellet is just one of the reasons Lafeber Company is considered the leader in avian nutrition. Our veterinarians and nutritionist determined the best combination of natural preservatives, specifically mixed tocopherols and citric acid, to protect the nutrients of Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet pellets.

The object: to eliminate your opponent's King or eliminate every other warrior in his army and leave your rival's King standing alone on the field of battle. Your knights and king are in position, and your infantry and archers are ready for their orders. Your next decision: rely on the unpredictable but lethal peasants? Take a chance on the bribable mercenaries? Or call in the heavy infantry? You're on a medieval battlefield, and war is imminent. Victory can be yours if you can eliminate your opponent's king--or kill off the rest of his troops and leave the king standing alone. In this chesslike strategy game, players begin with two rows of forces each, lined up on a game board-battlefield. As in chess, every unit moves in a particular way, and maneuvers are dependent on where and how far a piece can go. Combat dice with Battle-axes, Arrows, and Panic squares determine attack and battle outcomes. There are both basic and advanced versions of the game, making it a great choice for novice strategy game players to learn from and grow into. Detailed instructions make assembly and setup easy; contents include 92 battle figures and accessories, four blank dice with stick-on labels, and the Lionheart game board. <I>--Rachel Radway</I>" 0.9768244913817914

Based on the results of extensive computer simulations, this grind is ideally suited to working with thick stock and stacks of single- or double-sided laminates. The blade's teeth also feature 6-degree, negative hook angles, which helps prevent the blade from being too aggressive and further reduces the possibility of chipping. This blade is designed for optimal performance when cutting stacks of 3/4-inch laminates and melamine, and it's also an excellent performer in plywood and chipboard. This blade can also crosscut or rip wood, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This thick-stock saw blade's 48 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide "laminate blend." Formulated to extend tooth life in the face of work with laminates, melamine, and solid surfaces, this blend is extra hard--due to the proportion of high-density tungsten carbide that goes into it--and it still offers the mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo. With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money. <b>Silver I.C.E. Coating Resists Corrosion, Heat, and Resin Buildup</b><br>This blade is finished with Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which resists corrosion for improved performance over time. This unique coating also resists heat buildup, protecting your saw and your work surface and preventing the blade from warping. It also helps prevent resin or "pitch" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup means longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry. Freud is one of the few manufacturers of woodworking tools in the world that produces its own MicroGrain Carbide with Titanium, called TiCo, a high-density combination of Titanium and Cobalt.

Dimensions: -Dimensions: 13.2'''' H x 15'''' W x 56.5'''' D. To woodworkers who know the reputation of Jet products, the merit of this 12-inch variable-speed lathe should come as no surprise. Start with the guts of any tool, the motor. Prewired for 115 volts and fully encased in a metal housing for longer life, its 3/4-horses turn material at 500 to 3,000 rpm, depending on which of the six speeds you select. The cast-iron lathe bed, headstock, and tailstock provide superior vibration dampening and durability, while the heavy-gauge steel components and stand give rigid support. Pivoting 90 degrees for outboard turning of up to 16-1/2 inches on larger projects, the MT-2 headstock protects a Reeves drive pulley system with which we made quick and easy speed changes. Down on the other end, the hollow tailstock allows for longer hole bores and houses a live center, a luxury standard on all Jet lathes not found in much of the competition. You'll love the versatility that comes with 34-1/2 inches between working centers and a 12-inch swing capability over the bed (8-3/4 inches over the tool-rest base). All adjustments, whether extending the ram its full 2-1/4 inches or sliding the 12-inch tool rest, move fluidly and clamp down tight with little effort. Designed for use over the long haul, this tool has all the qualities professional woodworkers demand. <I>--Justin Paul</I>" COL title VAL "Woodstock D2738 1/32-Inch to 5/8-Inch JT3 Taper Drill Chuck" COL feature VAL "Chuck is JT3 and has 1/32 to 5/8-Inch bit capacity Features knurled grips Chuck key included" COL description VAL "Woodstock 1/32in 5/8in JT3 Taper Drill Chuck D2738 For those that prefer traditional keyed drill chucks, these chucks offer precision and nearly unlimited mechanical advantage for tightening and loosening drill bits and tooling." 0.9582651923719963

Simplex kettles are manufactured to the highest standards combining the virtues and traditions of Victorian design and elegance with the innovations of modern technology. Simplex still follows the original 1903 mission statement, "to manufacture by hand, the highest quality kettles, consistently and without doubt produce the finest craftsmanship available." When the lid is correctly fitted, which takes time to learn, and snapped in firmly, the kettle will whistle. If you have steam escaping from around the lid, then it is not correctly in place. You should be able to lift the kettle by the lid when it is in place. The kettles, when new, always whistle loudest with the whistle hole in the cap facing the spout. When you shake the kettle you should hear a ball rattle in the spout. Fill to the water line, fit the cap correctly, and the kettle will boil and whistle. 8-1/2" diameter x 10" H, with a 2 quart capacity" 0.9712656798315262

Smartly engineered so that the beater moves clockwise while the shaft moves counterclockwise, the beater reaches every part of the bowl without requiring it to rotate. 5 mixing speeds plus a stir setting means the appliance can do everything from folding cranberries into biscotti to whipping up a fluffy meringue. The all-metal construction includes a heavy-duty motor to handle stiff batters and a hardwearing transmission that ensures continuous power. The mixers seamless, stainless-steel, 5-quart bowl stands flat on its indented base and features sealed handle and bracket connections that meet NSF standards. A professional-style bowl lift raises it easily and securely into position, even if its brimming with weighty dough. The mixer comes with a burnished flat beater, a burnished dough hook, and a commercial wire whip. The flat beater is perfect for mixing cake batters, mashing potatoes, and stirring quick breads. The dough hook comes in handy for breads and coffee cakes, and the wire whip is your tool for icings and whipped cream. 4 sealed rubber feet hold the mixer stably in place, and a 3-wire, 6-foot power cord meets commercial requirements. As a safety mechanism, the overload reset button pops out if the mixer is overloaded, and the motor shuts off. If you only bake occasionally, a less heavy-duty unit will do the job. But if you work or recreate in the kitchen, this hard-working mixer can keep the pace. <i>--Emily Bedard</i> Editors note: This is a reconditioned appliance.

With Mariachi Imports sense of color, there is a rug or runner for every indoor and outdoor space you have. Mad Mats are made from 100% recycled plastic, are UV protected and fade-proof, and come with our one-year color guarantee. Because our rugs are handmade, pattern, color and size may vary slightly. Mad Mats' patterns are intricately woven. Multi-colored threads are woven in much the same fashion as real flat weave wool rugs. The result is a warmth and depth of color usually only available to the interior rug market. Most outdoor plastic mats on the market today are made from a combination of virgin polypropylene (PPL) and polystyrene. Mad Mats' plastic is completely different. First, our polypropylene is recycled from used soda bottles, milk bottles, packing, etc. We use only the highest grade of this recycled PPL. Then we combine it with state of the art conditioners and U.V. inhibitors to produce soft, resilient colorfast threads. Our soft tubular threads don't absorb dirt or stains of any kind. Leaves, debris, and food spills are easily rinsed away with a garden hose. They are truly carefree! This is a major advantage of Mad Mats. Most outdoor rugs are a dense weave of spun poly thread. They hold moisture for days which then gets tracked into the house. Grass, food, and dirt seep into the fiber where they remain until the rug is pulled up and washed, dried, and put back in place. YUCK! Mad Mats breathe. They don't trap water so they won't mildew and they won't rot wooden decks. Water goes right through them and evaporates right back out of them. Walking on Mad Mats the morning after a rainy night will leave your feet dry enough to walk right into the house. You put it down and that's it! All Mariachi products are produced under fair trade conditions. We do not work with factories that employ children or produce environmentally harmful waste."

Two separate families, Jean Sabatier of Le Moutier (lower Thiers) and Phillipe Sabatier of Bellevue (upper Thiers), began using the name in their makers mark. Over the years, many makers began using Sabatier in their branding. In general, it implies a high-quality knife made in the Thiers region of France using a fully forged process. As intellectual property standards were established in France, manufacturers were required to include a second word or symbol along with SABATIER and many marks were registered. In 1979, when one of the trademarks was sold and the brand began to be used on inferior products, the various trademark holders formed an association to protect the brand name and reputation. Only knives manufactured in Thiers, France from well established manufacturers from the 19th century are considered genuine Sabatier knives. With their glowing copper handles, the eight 4-1/2-inch knives in this set cut steaks, chops, and roasts into bite-size pieces with style. These are heavy, substantial knives with high-carbon, stainless-steel blades. The blades' fine serrations tend to tear rather than slice precisely through steak fibers. Made in China (unlike Sabatier's premier cutlery lines), the knives comes in a wood tray for safe storage on the counter or in a drawer and should be hand washed. <I>--Fred Brack</I>" 0.9299510391228232

Birds flock from miles around to consume these flavorful minerals. Hardened minerals provide a variable surface that attracts the birds curiosity. Solves two problems associated with most mineral blocks: Problem: Many birds just ignore the block, preventing them from ingesting vital nutrients. Solution: Once the bird roosts on the perch, it naturally rubs its beak along the wood and minerals; birds find the taste irresistible! From then on, the bird will chew through the perch to gain access to the mineral center. Problem: Some birds aggressively attack a new block, demolishing it in a few minutes.

And research shows that a diet of Purina ONE Urinary Tract Health Formula can help certain adult cats maintain a healthy urinary tract. How? With a diet that reduces urine pH and provides low dietary magnesium. Adult Cat Feeding Instructions: Fill your cat's bowl with the recommended measured amount every morning and allow your cat to eat on a "free choice" basis throughout the day, rather than as a single feeding at mealtime. Food intake required to maintain an ideal body condition will vary, depending on age, activity and environment. Monitor your cat's weight and adjust food amount accordingly. Fresh Water, Proper Diet & Veterinary Care: Be sure to provide fresh water in a clean container for your cat daily. Proper diet, exercise and veterinary care are the best ways to keep your cat healthy. If your cat hasn't had a check-up in the past year, please make an appointment today. Making the Switch to Purina ONE: Although you'll be anxious to see the difference Purina ONE can make in your cat, please allow 7-10 days to ease the transition from your cat's current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Purina ONE until you're feeding Purina ONE exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets.

It's constructed of dark porcelain surface and steel core absorb energy to heat rapidly. There are no PFOA's or other chemicals to alter food's taste, color or healthfulness. Porcelain is fused to the steel at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit producing a non-porous, inert glass surface that is naturally non-stick. Porcelain can chip if dropped, however this does not reduce the effectiveness of the cookware. It creates a smooth, hard finish that wont burn and resists staining. Its also non -porous so it wont trap odors or food particles and provides a low coefficient of friction  meaning that it cleans up easily and, it is corrosion and chemically resistant so it will last a long time. When fired, the vessel is placed on pins so the bottom and sides are hardened during the firing process into one smooth laminated glass surface. You may notice slight pin indentations where the glass has flowed around the pin that supports the base during firing. The pin marks do not compromise the finish or performance of the vessel. Not recommended for glass cooktops. This is your grandmother's pot--and her grandmother's, too. There are good reasons this black porcelain-on-steel cookware, with its classic granitelike styling, proves popular generation after generation. It's inexpensive, lightweight but sturdy, won't rust or corrode, and cleans easily. And it lasts a lifetime and beyond. This big pot is perfect for simmering broths, soups, and sauces; for boiling lots of pasta when the whole family arrives; for steaming heaps of vegetables; and for canning. The pot stands 12 inches high and is 11-1/4 inches in diameter. <I>--Fred Brack</I>" 0.9550264313271306

Made In China" COL description VAL "16PC. Stainless Steel 18/10 Cookware Set-Professional-Philippe Richard Use and Care Instructions are as follows: Before First Use: Wash pan in warm soapy water. 'Season' Pan with a small amount of cooking oil. Wipe off any excess oil. Oven Cooking: Non-Stick Cookware is oven safe to 350F. Do not use under the boiler as it may cause damage to the non-stick coating. Always use oven mittsor pot holders when removing pots or pans from the oven as the handles will also get hot. Glass lid is not recommended for oven use above 270F. Cooking Utensils: Tabletops Unlimited Inc. uses non-stick coating on the interiors of the cookware. Though this is a premium coating and is very durable, we do not recommend using metal utensils to mix, stir or release food from our pans. Wood, plastic or nylon tools are preferred. Do not use under the broiler as it may cause damage to the non-stick coating. Cleaning: Clean-up is as simple as using a sponge and warm soapy water, or cookware is also dishwasher safe. Do not use abrasive cleaning pads. Including a comprehensive cookware collection and an inclusive set of kitchen tools, this 16-piece ensemble from Philippe Richard establishes a strong foundation for any first time kitchen owner. Attractive and durable, the pans feature 18/10 stainless-steel construction with securely riveted handles and snuggly fitting, tempered glass lids. Thanks to an encapsulated aluminum disk in the base of each vessel, heat distributes quickly and evenly allowing for the prevention of unwanted hot spots. Generously sized loop handles and finger indentations along their straighter counterparts provide comfort during use. On the downside, the steel handle material retains heat and as a result requires the use of a cloth or potholder. While the glass lid construction affords the convenience of food monitoring, its disadvantage lies in the limited ability to withstand oven temperatures above 270 degrees F. The cookware set consists of an 8-inch omelet pan and 10-inch skillet for frying and sauting; a 2-quart saucepan and 3-quart casserole pan with lids for cooking pasta and steaming vegetables; and a generous 6-quart Dutch oven with lid for making hearty stews or cooking a cluster of full-cob corn. Each item in the utensil collection features durable nylon construction for safe use with nonstick pans and stain resistance. Conveniently stored in an included ceramic holder, the kitchen tools include: 11-3/4-inch ladle, 12-inch pasta server, 12-inch serving spoon, 12-inch slotted spoon, 12-1/2-inch spatula, 13-inch slotted spatula, and a 13-inch perforated skimmer.

These comfortable, molded handles are break-proof, sanitary, and colorfast. In addition, the super bolster and full rat-tail tang provides weight, insures safety, and adds balance.   Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of J.A. Henckels exclusive high-carbon, no-stain steel formula under the all-new SIGMAFORGE standard. As a result, Four Star knives have improved quality consistency, lasting sharpness, and perfect geometry. SIGMAFORGE one-piece construction also provides high precision and improved stability of the blade and steel structure, thus improving cutting-edge retention for lasting sharpness. In addition, Four Star knives use J.A. Henckels' FRIODUR ice hardening for corrosion resistance, a process that also contributes to cutting-edge retention. Manufactured in Germany. A 12-inch chef's knife is the largest made, suitable for professional chefs and serious cooks with good knife skills. Its curved, stainless-steel blade is perfect for rocking through chopping and mincing tasks; as a kitchen workhorse, the knife is also useful for cutting and slicing. Like other top-grade Henckels knives, Four Star blades are formed by a high-tech welding process that combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics. Traditionalists might insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are stronger than the steel. Knife handles don't have full tangs, but they're made of tough polypropylene. <i>--Fred Brack</i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines.

The blade is well-suited to cutting both hard-and softwood, as well as cutting through stacks of manmade material. It features teeth with a triple-chip grind (TCG). In this configuration, each flat-top tooth is followed by a trapezoidal tooth that's slightly higher. The trapezoidal tooth delivers a precut slot that's narrower than the final kerf, which helps prevent brittle materials--like chipboard--from chipping near the blade. Plus, the large gullets between these teeth ensure quicker cuts and easy chip removal. The blade's ideal crosscutting range includes materials that are 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thick, while the range when ripping includes materials that are 3/8 to 3/4-inch thick. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This heavy-duty saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide "general purpose blend." Formulated to maximize density, hardness, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance, this blend is ideally matched to the varied demands that are placed on a multi-purpose saw blade. With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money. <b>Silver I.C.E. Coating Resists Corrosion, Heat, and Resin Buildup</b><br>This blade is finished with Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which resists corrosion for improved performance over time. This unique coating also resists heat buildup, protecting your saw and your work surface and preventing the blade from warping. It also helps prevent resin or "pitch" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup means longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry. Freud is one of the few manufacturers of woodworking tools in the world that produces its own MicroGrain Carbide with Titanium, called TiCo, a high-density combination of Titanium and Cobalt.

Ideal for large-volume production work, this blade features 80 teeth with a triple-chip grind. The blade's teeth also feature 10-degree, positive hook angles, which contribute to the blade's speed and extended tooth life. This blade is designed for optimal performance when cutting laminate or melamine that ranges from 1/4 to 1-5/8 inches in thickness. It's also an excellent performer when working with plywood and chipboard, and a solid performer when crosscutting wood. This blade can also rip wood, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This laminate saw blade's 80 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide "laminate blend." Formulated to extend tooth life in the face of work with laminates, melamine, and solid surfaces, this blend is extra hard--due to the proportion of high-density tungsten carbide that goes into it--and it still offers the mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo. With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money. <b>Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat Buildup</b><br>Built to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp. As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or "pitch" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

Anti-vibration system exclusive to Super Sawzall. Adjustable shoe release lever. Pivot shoe for maximum support against work surface. Heavy duty steel Quik Lok blade clamp system enables user to change blades quickly and easily without the use of a hex wrench. 8 3-wire Quik Lok cord. Impact Resistant Carrying Case and two blades included This item will take 2-3 weeks to ship. Shipments cannot be expedited on this item. For years, Milwaukee's Sawzalls have been valued for their outstanding ability to cut through almost any material: wood, nail-embedded wood, steel, cast iron, aluminum, brass, drywall, composition materials, hard rubber, cement, brick, plaster, and fiberglass. The Super Sawzall features variable-speed control, with a speed control dial for faster cutting and better efficiency and control over a wide range of materials and applications. The blade is reversible, too, allowing you to cut upside down in tight spaces. For those of you who've grown up with Sawzalls, you'll appreciate the addition of the handy Quik-Lok blade clamp, which lets you change blades quickly without having to use a hex wrench; this feature is especially convenient when you're cutting hard materials, such as steel, a situation in which blades break frequently. There's also a handy quick lever adjustment for the shoe. We really like this tool's counterbalancing mechanism, which reduces some of the unavoidable vibration found in reciprocating saws. The difference you feel when operating this tool, compared to nonbalanced saws, is significant: the Super Sawzall is still extremely powerful, yet it has a smooth feel. As a result, of course, you can work longer with less fatigue than you can using other, unbalanced saws. Another significant feature is the clutch, which absorbs shock and impacts to the internal mechanics caused by sudden blade lockups (typically encountered during extreme use). While this is unquestionably a heavy tool, it does have a comfortable, ergonomically designed rubber grip that gives you a solid hold. And you can rely on the Super Sawzall to handle the most difficult jobs, either at home or at work. <I>--Tim Block</I>" COL title VAL "Johnson Level &amp; Tool 183 18-Inch Standard Aluminum Level - 3 vial" COL feature VAL "Aluminum I-beam frame 360 degree reading vials Quik-Change replaceable plastic covers V-grooved edge" COL description VAL "18&quot; Standard Aluminum Level with 3 acrylic Vials great for all basic leveling jobs convenient size will fit in many tool bags Inexpensive, lightweight extruded aluminum I-beam frame.

It's a cross between a ball and a star, and measures 5.5 inches across. But pick it up by any one of its dozens of plastic points and this amazing little feat of engineering, or <i>imagineering</i>, expands neatly into a lattice-like globe that's 12 inches in diameter. The inventor calls it a trapezoidal icosatetrahedron; you could also call it a  <a href="/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471198129/${0}">Bucky Ball</a>, but either way, it's a fascinating exercise in complex simplicity. The structure is rigid enough to roll and throw, yet if touched in the right way, it will suddenly collapse again, curling in on itself like a defensive hedgehog.

Made from CROMOVA 18 stainless steel, this light knife was created for optimum performance. It was made from a single piece of steel, and has a convex edge for easier slicing. The strength comes from the ice hardening process that reaches a Rockwell degree of C-56-58. It has a wide blade with a thick edge to give you ultimate control. Using this knife feels good on the hands thanks to the hollowed handle and compact design, making it ergonomic for repetitive use. The iconic Global dimple design is on the traditional handle for a nonslip grip. 7" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who like hefty knives, its original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. This knife, however, is relatively heavy. Thick at the back, the broad, 7-inch blade, designed for butchering fish and chopping hard vegetables, carries enough weight to chop through fish bones. For clean, low-friction cutting, the blade is tapered to an edge on only one side so it's even sharper than other Global knives. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>" 0.9558166780975931

This is the barrel-grip version of Bosch's bestselling top-handle 1587 model. Many woodworkers prefer the barrel grip on this model, however, arguing that it's easier to cut scrolls and curves when the saw is pushed forward (as opposed to down). Aside from the difference in grip, this saw is much like its top-handle counterpart: the balance is superb, the 5 amp motor packs plenty of power, the foot plate tilts left and right (up to 45 degrees), and the base retracts for flush cutting. The tool-free blade-changing system also works well. Simply put, this a compact, powerful, well-designed saw--a perfect buy for users who prefer barrel grips. <I>--Jon Groebner</I>" COL title VAL "Vaughan 612-02 Claw Hammer Handles 14&quot; Supreme Adze Eye 20 oz Claw Hammer" COL feature VAL "This item is Claw Hammer Handles - 14" supreme adze eye-20-oz. claw hammer Used for Handtools & Tool Organizers, Hammers The product is manufactured in United States" COL description VAL "This item is Claw Hammer Handles - 14" supreme adze eye-20-oz. claw hammer .

Ideal for working with materials that are 1-1/2 to 3-1/2-inches thick, it can be used in manual feeding situations or with power feeders, and it can handle both single- and gang-rip operations. It has a 1-inch arbor and produces a 0.177 kerf. In addition to offering faster cuts through thick materials, its large-tooth design allows the blade to be safely sharpened more times, prolonging the life of the blade and saving you money. Also, the large gullets between the teeth ensure easy chip removal. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features an anti-vibration design that reduces chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This thick-stock, rip saw blade's 24 teeth are finished with tips made from an application-specific TiCo high-density carbide that offers improved hardness, corrosion resistance, and heat resistance. Ideal for the demands of ripping large quantities of thick, hard wood, this carbide blend includes extra cobalt for increased impact resistance. In addition, it delivers increased sharpness and edge retention, which means the blade will hold up longer--saving you money. <b>Silver I.C.E. Coating Resists Corrosion, Heat, and Resin Buildup</b><br>This blade is finished with Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which resists corrosion for improved performance over time. This unique coating also resists heat buildup, protecting your saw and your work surface, and preventing the blade from warping. It also helps prevent resin or "pitch" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup means longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited, lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

Applying BladeArmor coating to tape blades reduces both tape breakage and tape returns, enabling it to conquer the toughest testing ground of all -- the job site! The Stanley Works, originally a bolt and door hardware manufacturing company located in New Britain, Connecticut; was founded in 1843 by Frederick T. Stanley. A few years later, in 1857, Fredericks cousin, Henry Stanley, founded The Stanley Rule and Level Company. In 1920, The Rule and Level Company merged with The Stanley Works and would go on to become its famous Hand Tools Division. Over the years, The Stanley Works has produced some of the most innovative and useful tools ever made. Among these tools are the Bailey Plane, the Surform shaper, the PowerLock tape rule and most recently the FatMax line of products.

Would You Rather takes the idea of parlor game questions to a new level of debate and lunacy. This version has content that is very edgy. It is not for the easily squeamish and it is not appropriate for players under 18 years old. It creates an outrageous, hilarious evening of fun by pushing the envelope. 1500 twisted questions that range from the heinous to the nauseating to the downright disturbing, each a field-tested conversation starter-because no matter how strange or far-fetched, "Neither" is not an option here! No matter how awful the alternatives are, it's up to the group to reach a consensus. Read the "would you rather" question, then let the conversation and laughter rip. Discuss and debate the mind-boggling options and see just how long it takes you all to agree on the absurd! To win, you must move around the board by correctly predicting the group consensus to each of your questions and complete three of the even more absurd "would you rather" challenges. Some questions, like a Rorschach test, reveal values: Would you rather...Age only from the neck up-OR-age only from the neck down? Would you rather...Be stupid and rich-OR-smart and poor? Some delight in their own grossness: Would you rather...Eat three earthworms-OR-wear a necklace made of them on your wedding day? Would you rather...Be trapped in an elevator with wet dogs-OR-three fat men with bad breath? Some churn up prejudices: Would you rather...Lose your mate to the same sex as yourself-OR-the opposite sex? Some create that squirming sensation: Would you rather... Get a bad case of poison ivy way up inside your nose-OR-inside your inner ear? Or ethical dilemmas: Would you rather...Be president of a firm that poaches endangered species-OR-work for a corrupt politician? And some are just deliciously absurd: Would you rather...Catch a porcupine thrown from a second story window-OR-a skunk thrown from the same window?"

Built for people age seven and up with a maximum weight of 180 pounds, the Moon Boots have adjustable bindings to fit up to a USA mens size 9. They are constructed of heavy duty plastic but the construction is such that the boots look likely to stay intact.

Just pick a size, pick a color, and get ready to inspire neighborhood-wide envy. At Weber they believe that grilling should be as fun as it is flavorful. Self-proclaimed perfectionists, they've dedicated themselves to that standard since 1952 when they made their first charcoal kettle. That's because they know that when you've got friends and family hovering around the grill, hungry for that unmistakable charcoal flavor, the last thing you want to contend with is shoddy construction or burnt food. So Weber did their homework, designing products that won't let you down. The result? Grills that don't require an engineering degree to assemble, last for many long years of dependable service and--most importantly--deliver exceptionally delicious grilled results every time. Weber kettles combine traditional design with innovation in production. Made of steel and coated with porcelain enamel, the bowl and lid are formed exactly right to allow heat to circulate around the inside of the grill for even cooking. The porcelain enamel is baked on at approximately 1500 degrees F ensuring that your grill will not only withstand the heat of many cookings, but also resist rust- and burn-through. In addition, the smooth, hard-wearing surface makes cleanup easy. Closed-lid cooking is a signature of Weber products. The damper system created by Weber allows for control of the heat inside the unit without lifting the lid. Simply adjusting the damper provides temperatures low enough to smoke food for hours or high enough the sear steaks. Made of rust-resistant aluminum and placed just so in the lid, the damper is as durable as it is functional Every Weber charcoal cooking grate provides ample cooking area for any meal. Made of heavy-duty plated steel, these cooking grates are durable and easy to clean, and they can hold enough heat to give you beautiful sear marks. The hinged grates have an area on either side that lifts to allow access to the fuel without lifting the whole grate or removing food from the grill. Adding or adjusting charcoal is hassle free and easy. The Weber charcoal grate has what it takes to withstand the heat of any charcoal fire. Made of heavy-duty plated steel, these durable grates won't warp or burn through. Additionally, they give you enough space for a direct set-up or an indirect set-up. Weber charcoal grates give you the flexibility to cook the way you want. The One-Touch cleaning system makes cleanup hassle free. As you rotate the handle, the three blades in the bowl move ash through the vents in the bowl and down into the ash catcher. The aluminum ash catcher lifts out for easy ash disposal and cleaning. The fully enclosed ash catcher keeps ashes from blowing around and is easily detached for quick and clean ash removal. This not only makes cleaning out the bowl a breeze but also helps keep you cooking longer by preventing the build-up of ashes that blocks vents and suffocates the fire. In addition to providing a quick and easy way to clean the bowl, the One-Touch cleaning system also acts as a second damper. The same vents that allow ash to fall easily out of the bowl help bring oxygen up to the fire. Closing the One-Touch cleaning system and the top damper allow you to choke out the fire easily. As part of the One-Touch series, the 22.5-inch Gold kettle grill provides a plated-steel hinged cooking grate that measures 22-1/2 inches in diameter for 363 square inches of total cooking space. The sleek unit also features a heavy-gauge porcelain-enameled bowl and lid with glass-reinforced nylon handles, rust-resistant vents, durable all-weather wheels, and a removable, aluminum, high-capacity ash catcher. Best of all, the grill's aluminized-steel One-Touch cleaning system allows you to empty the ash in seconds without getting your hands dirty. Overall, the grill measures 22-1/2 inches long by 27 inches wide by 38-1/2 inches high and carries a 10-year limited warranty. <b>Note:</b> Images shown above are of the Weber One-Touch Charcoal Kettle series in Black; features illustrated vary by model. When George Stephen created the first Weber grill, he wanted to be able to bring his family together for a good meal. He insisted on a product that would exceed customers' expectations. In the years since then, the Weber name has become synonymous with backyard barbecues and the family, friends, and good times that go with them. At Weber, they continue that tradition of excellence in everything they do from the development of new grills and accessories to the services they provide to customer and dealers. From the very beginning, Weber revolutionized backyard grilling. Since then, they have continued to develop products that enhance the grilling experience. From the original kettle with heat controlling dampers to electronic temperature controls and Flavorizer bars, Weber continues to be at the forefront of modern grilling, making the backyard a part of your kitchen. Weber grills have been and will continue to be the true definition of performance in backyard grilling. Whether you're cooking a basic burger or an extensive meal, Weber grills are designed and engineered to give you the best performance every time. Service is of the utmost importance at Weber. Their Customer and Dealer Service associates work every day to ensure that their customers and dealers have the support they need." 0.867877862988682

If everyone knew how incredibly cool life in the sewer could actually be, perhaps a lot more people would live down there. Well, maybe not.

While none of those characters are represented here in action figure form, anyone who already has those figures (or any action figures, really) will find plenty of fun things going on in the Turtle's lair. A working, hand-cranked elevator travels from street level to the two levels below while a rope slide lets the boys rappel from one floor to the next. The centerpiece of the set is a combat area where figures placed on specific points on the floor can be made to spin around when you twist their corresponding knobs. There are also spring-loaded plunger missiles, a trap door, and a couch that springs back.

This movie really scares you. So what do you do? Naturally,  you go out and buy a creepy, knife-wielding doll named Chucky. From the Movie Maniacs II series of  collectible horror movie "heroes," this little Chucky's resemblance to his movie counterpart is uncanny  enough to make a person nervous. Like all McFarlane action figures this is a very detailed, well-done  collectible. For the record, it's rated PG-13.  It's time to play.

You can also animate this Snowy Owl's feather-soft wings to create a real flap in your neck of the woods. Ideal for use in interactive stage and puppet theater, Folkmanis Puppets are also great for teaching, daycare, school, pretend play, games and parties, or to pair with a book for storytelling. Easy to feed and care for, just add lots of love and snuggly fun. This puppet measures 9 x 21 x 10 inches (LxWxH). Folkmanis has been encouraging young imaginations to blossom since 1976 with its innovative and engaging specialty puppets, promoting creativity and discovery while winning nearly every industry, child development, and kid-tested award. Folkmanis has grown to become the premier manufacturer of plush puppets worldwide, offering over 200 of the most heartwarming and realistically designed creatures--both exotic and familiar--on the market today. Puppets nurture the imagination, inspire creativity, develop interactive play, and expand language. This reviewer has found them to be excellent tools for teaching foreign languages--children will comfortably experiment when manipulating a puppet, but not when simply talking to a friend. As children mature, they are able to use puppets in a more sophisticated manner that will help them last a good long time. Snowy Owl is well made and true to form with her white and gray spotted fur. The texture of her leather beak and talons gives her an air of authenticity, and her large glass eyes ringed with thick white fur won't miss a rodent. A plastic stick inside Snowy Owl's body lets you rotate her head 360 degrees. With a wingspan of 22 inches, she will play a prominent role on the puppet stage. <I>--Sandy Hirsch</I>" 0.9587699726751935

COL description VAL "This flag is also called the Gonzales Banner of 1835. In 1831 Mexican authorities provided the settlers of Gonzales with a cannon for their protection. As Santa Anna assumed more power and civil unrest began to spread, the Mexican military felt it unwise to leave the residents of Gonzales with a weapon so the Mexican Military Militia went to Gonzales to retrieve the cannon. The Texans responded by raising a banner that included a star over a cannon over the words "Come and Take it".  It is important to remember that since no physical evidence is available and the earliest written account dates decades after the flag was used, it is almost impossible to know the exact cannon design and coloring of the Gonzales Banner." 0.9781771750265408

Timex It takes a licking and keeps on ticking. <div class="aplus"> Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico. The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the "Switzerland of America." Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time. During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through "torture tests," such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan "It takes a licking and keeps on ticking." With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches. The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality. One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity. Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you."

The unit not only easily accommodates larger ingredients, but its functional profile also maximizes convenient side-by-side space on the stovetop. Made of heavy-duty cast iron, the cookware's colorful, long-lasting exterior enamel resists chipping and cracking, while its durable, nonreactive sand-colored interior enamel offers a smooth surface for cooking and an optimal palette for food presentation. As cast iron is unexcelled for even heat distribution and superior heat retention, and enamel is impervious to acids and odors, the oven browns and cooks food uniformly and gently without hot spots and can be used for marinating, cooking on the stovetop, or finishing in the oven. Two loop cast-iron side handles help ensure a steady grip during transport--even when wearing bulky oven mitts, and the unit's secure-fitting lid locks in heat and moisture while cooking. The lid also comes fitted with a black phenolic knob that's oven-safe up to 350 degrees F. Beautiful enough for the table yet durable enough to outlive its lifetime limited warranty, the French oven can be safely used on any stovetop, including induction, and should be hand washed for best results. Beautiful enough to bring to the table, yet durable enough to  outlive its 101-year warranty against defects, this heavy casserole is  perfect for preparing and ceremoniously serving dishes such as  choucroute garni and braised lamb shanks. The oval shape handles big  cuts of meat and big birds. Use it in the oven or on the stovetop for  soups and chili. Made of cast-iron, which is unexcelled for its heat  distribution and retention, this French oven cooks foods evenly and  gently without hot spots at low temperatures and is suitable for all  heat sources. This pan holds 5 quarts and its exterior and interior  are clad in two coats of Le Creuset's famous enamel. The plastic  knob on its heavy, tight-fitting lid is ovenproof to 450 degrees F.  Loop handles facilitate carrying, and the casserole is dishwasher-safe.  Like all Le Creuset cast-iron products, it is hand-cast in a  one-of-a-kind sand mold and hand-finished at the Le Creuset factory in  France. <I>--Fred Brack</I>" COL title VAL "Wusthof Classic 6.3-Inch Hollow Edge Euro-Utility Knife (16cm)" COL feature VAL "Narrow 6.3-inch blade for lunch meats, cheese, carving, slicing Alternating hollows on blade's sides prevent food from clinging Blade, bolster, tang forged from single piece of high-carbon stainless steel Tough polypropylene handle with full tang and traditional three rivets Made in Germany" COL description VAL "The Wusthof Classic 6 inch hollow edge utility knife is a must have for cutting sandwiches, sausage, fruits, vegetables, and other kitchen utility tasks. Wusthof Classic knives are forged from a single piece of high carbon no-stain steel, a specially alloyed steel. Painstakingly manufactured, these knives are pure fun to work with and will turn even the preparation of a simple dish into a culinary pleasure. Made in Solingen, Germany. Tough polypropylene handles with full, visible tangs and the traditional three rivets distinguish Classic knives from Wsthof's other cutlery lines. Otherwise Classic knives are identical to other Wsthof knives, embodying all the virtues that earn the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a Wsthof knife-- blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, Wsthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. With its narrow blade, this 6-inch utility knife neatly slices lunch meat, cheese, vegetables, and large fruits as well as carves a roast, ham, or turkey into serving portions. Alternating hollows on each side of the blade create air pockets, allowing slices to fall away cleanly and permitting thinner slicing. Like all fine knives, it should be hand washed with the care a lifetime investment deserves. <I>--Fred Brack</I>" 0.7607839728524332

And what gets you back to your family or guests faster than putting these American-made pieces in the dishwasher? Who doesnt remember growing up, waiting for the juicy Thanksgiving turkey to emerge from the oven in that dark, speckled oval roaster? Now you can own your very own. Or add to your collection. Bringing comfort foodjust the way mom used to make itto your own table. Ideally suited for a 12-pound bird or a 15-pound roast, this oval roaster boasts even heating and faster cooking times because of its unique construction. Our roasters have a strong carbon steel body perfect for absorbing and distributing heat evenly and quickly. They are energy efficient; the dark surface absorbs the ovens energy, lowering cooking times. Porcelain is fused to the steel at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit producing a non-porous, inert glass surface that is naturally non-stick. Porcelain can chip if dropped, however this does not reduce the effectiveness of the cookware. They are safe for metal utensils, easy to clean, and dishwasher safe! Won't Discolor or Alter Taste of Food:</br> They are great for flavor! Since the glass surface is inert and will not absorb foods, the taste is not altered like it can be with other surfaces. There are no PTFEs, PFOAs or any other chemicals to change the taste, color or nutritional value of the food. Roasters designed to accommodate weight of ingredients:</br> There is a Granite Ware roaster perfectly suited for any size meal, oven or food preparation method. Whether grilling, broiling, baking or roasting, we have a size and configuration to handle the task. Our roasters are equally at home in oven or on the grill.

Your foot flows through the motion just as it does when walking on sand -- your heel contacts first, then rolls up to the toes for push off. This eliminates the "tingling foot" sensation found on other ellipticals, and initiates core activation. The gel cushioning provides additional traction and shock absorption. Multiply workout options with power incline and premium handlebars: With the touch of a console button, use any of the 20 levels of power incline to take your workout to the next level or to vary the muscle groups you're working. Our premium, multi-grip handles help you find the position that's just right for your body. Quality you can feel: Long, 20-inch stride length is smooth and fluid. Enjoy a low-impact workout while diversifying your exercise routine with the Livestrong LS13.0E elliptical trainer. The LS13.0E reduces stress on your legs by mimicking the natural path of your ankle, knee, and hip joints. Because your feet remain on the pedals at all times, there is zero impact, making the trainer a great option for people with sensitive joints, folks who are rehabbing after knee injuries, or even newcomers starting a fitness program for the first time. An elliptical also offers a full-body workout that includes resistance for the quadriceps, chest, back, hamstrings, glutes, triceps, and biceps. As a result, you'll tone your muscles while keeping your metabolic heart rate up, helping you burn calories long after your workout is finished. <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="225"> <tbody><tr><td><img align="top" border="0" height="225" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/detail-pages/B0065MU6KQ-1.jpg" width="225" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The console includes built-in speakers, an LCD display, and 2 LED feedback windows.</strong></em></small></td></tr></tbody></table> <b>Quality You Can Feel</b><br> It takes a heavy flywheel to produce a smooth performance. The LS13.0E more than qualifies, with a 30-pound flywheel that produces a smooth, fluid motion designed to withstand years of use. The trainer also offers a long 20-inch stride length and unique MaxTone pedals. Paired with a flat ellipse shape, the stride length encourages a natural walking and running motion for users of all heights. The MaxTone pedals, meanwhile, incorporate the science of balance training to keep your feet aligned. Your foot will flow through the motion just as it does when walking on sand--your heel contacts first, then rolls up to the toes for push off. This eliminates the "tingling foot" sensation found on other ellipticals and initiates core activation. Even the frame itself is designed to create a natural feel. Derived from extensive biomechanics research, the SixStar-certified frame focuses on all areas that impact the feel and comfort of an elliptical, including body positioning, handlebar spacing, elliptical footpath, pedal placement, elliptical access, and the trainer's drive mechanism. <b>Train Like a Pro</b><br> The LS13.0E includes 12 different workout programs to keep you fit, including Manual, Weight Loss, Muscle Toner, Strength Builder, Constant Watts, Mellow Johnny's Trail, Lance's Climb, Lance's Descent, Max Cardio, the Tour, Custom, and downloadable Livestrong.com programs. The trainer is also equipped with a Power Incline function. With the touch of a button, you can take your workout to the next level with 20 different incline levels. And it's easy to monitor your workout progress thanks to the built-in console, which includes a backlit LCD display and two LED feedback windows that track your time, resistance, incline, distance, speed, and more. <b>Livetrack Interactive Technology</b><br> Research shows that people who journal their fitness routines achieve greater success on average than those who do not. Exclusive to Livestrong Fitness, Livetrack Interactive technology allows you to do just that. Each time you work out, simply insert the USB device that comes with your treadmill into the console. When you're finished, transfer the USB to your computer. Within seconds, you'll be able to track your workout history on the Daily Plate feature of Livestrong.com. In addition, you can enter your meals and snacks on the daily food journal--with more than 800,000 items from which to choose--and get instant feedback on your calories consumed and calories burned.

The award-winning ProHeat system efficiently and evenly browns the bread, and prolongs the life of the appliance. The chunky, retro design features an insulated stainless steel body with extra-wide 28 mm slots to accommodate thick English muffins and bagels. Or make yourself a hot sandwich using the Sandwich Cage with built-in drip tray (sold separately). The manual ejector system keeps toast warm until you're ready to eat it, and the browning dial allows you to choose your favorite toast shade. Includes auto shutoff, energy-efficient 2- or 4-slice toasting option, removable crumb tray and adjustable rear foot to compensate for uneven countertops. Imported. 9Hx8Wx14L". Engineered in England and hand-assembled to the last detail, the Dualit 4-slice toaster is that ideal accomplishment--a hardworking kitchen appliance with an elegant presence. Its curvy retro shape is undeniably handsome and its structural components withstand the rigors of a high-octane kitchen. In fact, the toaster can output up to 130 slices per hour, should the entire neighborhood ever depend on you for breakfast or tea. The key to Dualit's exceptionally even browning is the toaster's system of patented ProHeat elements, a series of flat bars behind a smooth, transparent coating. The result is an efficient, durable design, suitable for everything from brioche to sandwiches. The elements are encased by a rugged, stainless-steel housing that you may not even recognize as a relative of its lightweight, plasticky peers. Each slot measures 28 mm wide and is extra deep to allow for the use of the Dualit sandwich cage (sold separately). One adjustable leg accommodates uneven surfaces and rubberized feet protect your countertop. The Dualit toaster has manually operated functions and is designed for people who like to engage with their appliances. Operation is simple but rewarding. A rocker switch selects 2- or 4-slice toasting, and a 4-minute timer knob lets you fine-tune browning time. Instead of a pop-up function that can prematurely cool toast, the unit comes with an ejector knob that you raise when you're ready for it. For smaller households or busy kitchens, Dualit also makes 2- and 3-slice models. All Dualit toasters come with a one-year warranty. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>" 0.9149009549929797

The exact variety varies with the season." COL description VAL "Lithops, (commonly called "flowering stones" or "living stones") are true mimicry plants: their shape, size and color causes them to resemble small stones in their natural surroundings. The plants blend in among the stones as a means of protection. Grazing animals which would otherwise eat them during periods of drought to obtain moisture usually overlook them. Even experts in the field sometimes have difficulty locating plants for study because of this unusual deceptive camouflage. In the wild, Lithops inhabit vast dry regions of southern Africa. Several areas in which these plants grow receive less than 2 inches of rainfall per month throughout the entire year. In an extreme situation of low rainfall, at least one species of Lithops depends on mist or fog to provide its main source of moisture . Lithops could not survive in many areas that they are found were it not for their capacity to store water. In fact, almost the entire plant is devoted to this function. The "body" of the plant is divided into two succulent leaves fused together in the shape of an inverted cone. The fissure or slit at the top of the plant is the division of the two leaves. There is no stem as such, but rather the taproot joins abruptly at the base of the leaves. The structure of the plant reveals to the imagination the harsh environment in which Lithops live: the scarcity of water demands that young plants limited to only two leaves and a root system, as more extravagant growth would only serve to waste water. The leaves are thick to store enough water for the plants to survive for months without rain. The plants are small and keep a low profile to minimize the effect of the intense heat and light of their climate. Lithops do well if they receive about 4 or 5 hours of direct (or only slightly filtered) sunlight during the early part of the day, and partial shade during the afternoon. The exact variety you will receive varies with the season." 0.8985441709460039
