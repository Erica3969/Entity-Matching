Made in Italy, this 1,250-watt machine eliminates the fuss of creating espresso and espresso drinks at home by automating the entire process. With the push of a button, the machine grinds coffee beans without burning them, tamps the ground coffee into the brew group, brews a cup of espresso, and then dumps the spent grounds into a container--all in about 30 seconds. For creating a cappuccino or latte, there's a hot water/steam wand with a milk-frothing attachment. (With this model, there's a 35-second delay from brewing to steaming, and 15 seconds from steaming to brewing.) A button selects one or two cups, and a knob adjusts cup size up to 10 ounces. For safety, the machine shuts off if the grinder runs out of beans or the water tank is empty (control-panel lights indicate specific problems).<P> The machine measures 15 inches high, 13 inches wide, and 13 inches deep; weighs 19 pounds; and, with a gleaming, marble-gray plastic exterior, looks great on the counter.

B models have three burners, and C models have three burners and a side burner. All models feature a unique, patented Flavorizer bar cooking system, patented hanging LP fuel scale (LP models only), two granite-style thermoset work surfaces, Crossover ignition system, solid robot-welded carts, and a double-walled stainless steel hood. Stainless steel is a very durable choice of materials, but intense heat will cause it to discolor. Weber engineers solved this problem with a double-walled design. Air trapped between the walls insulates the handsome brushed stainless exterior maintaining its showroom condition. All Genesis Gold models also feature Weber's Stop Watch Engineering because the last thing you want is a hassle putting your grill together. Now all it takes to get your grill together is ten minutes, no more than eight fasteners, and a single tool. We even throw in the tool. All propane models include a 20-pound propane tank. All models also feature a limited lifetime warranty. At first glance, Weber gas grills look like something that might be shot into space or driven in a Formula 1 race rather than the sleek cooking machines they really are. This is an understandable mistake, because with its Genesis series of grills, Weber has made the time-honored tradition of outdoor cooking state-of-the-art, virtually putting an entire kitchen at your fingertips and on your patio. The Genesis Gold C features a generous 611 square inches of total cooking area, which includes the primary cooking area, a warming rack, and a warm-up basket. Its three stainless-steel burners supply an input of 39,000 Btu's per hour and provide 550-degree broiling temperatures without wasting fuel. The Genesis Gold C also features a side burner, rated at 10,000 Btu's per hour, that is perfect for creating a side dish to accompany your perfectly cooked main course. In place of the lava rock, pumice stone, or flat metal plates found in most common gas grills, Weber grills feature the company's patented Flavorizer bars, which do not retain dripped fats. Instead, juices sizzle and smoke when they hit the Flavorizers, eliminating potentially disastrous flare-ups and imparting a delectable smoky flavor to your feast. Getting the grill ready to cook that feast doesn't take long, either. Weber's Crossover ignition system enables you to effortlessly start all three burners, which have been positioned to heat your food evenly. A dual-purpose thermometer included in the front of the grill unit measures the temperature under the double-walled stainless-steel hood; it can also be removed and used as a meat thermometer to ensure a thoroughly cooked meal every time. And you won't need to scramble for seasonings (or recipes--Weber provides a cookbook) or use a separate table while cooking, thanks to several convenient features. In addition to the handy work surface on one side of the unit, a wire condiment basket hangs along the front of the grill, keeping condiments, spices, marinades, or other barbecue necessities close at hand. A wire shelf is situated beneath the grill and stretches the length of the unit, and three wire tool hooks hang below the work surface, ready for your spatula, meat fork, and basting brush. Weber natural gas grills also come with a 12-foot quick-disconnect hose. With its lid open, the Genesis Gold C measures 61-1/2 inches tall, 69-1/2 inches wide, and 33 inches deep. This powerful cooking machine is easily moved, however, thanks to its crackproof all-weather wheels and locking casters, which prevent it from moving when you're cooking. While a grill cover is recommended to protect your grill from the elements, Weber's engineers did take outdoor storage into consideration and, with the help of entomologists, added special spiderproof screens to prevent the burner tubes from being clogged by cobwebs or nests. This grill features Weber's Stop Watch engineering. Now it takes approximately 10 minutes to assemble your grill with no more than eight fasteners and a single tool. Weber even throws in the tool.
