By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

This means the machine moves in the same natural motion as your body does, providing a true running feel. Inferior designs can have either too much vertical movement or too much horizontal movement; those units will often make the user feel off-balanced while exercising. The E1, however, will keep you in a balanced upright position for a stable and secure feel. The E1 also has a balanced steel frame which eliminates rocking while maintaining a compact footprint, which makes it ideal for your home workout area (particularly when space is a concern). Combined with its durable components, the steel frame supports users up to 275 pounds while the unit's front transport wheels make it easy to move around. Proper pedal spacing on this elliptical eliminates hip fatigue--when your feet are forced out too wide or in too narrow, your body will incur undue strain on your hips. The E1 also offers a comfortable step-up height to allow you to start your workouts safely while its moving arms recruit your upper body and core to the workout, making this a total body trainer. <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="200"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/best-fit-2-full.jpg" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The E1 offers a compact footprint that's ideal for smaller spaces.</strong></em></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> To track your workout metrics, the E1 offers contact heart rate handles for advanced monitoring.

With the Sauron expansion, the fellowship of Hobbits are no longer competing solely against the game and its boards. In Sauron one player takes on the role of the dark lord and seeks to thwart the fellowship's crucial mission. Okay look, we've all seen the movies, many of us have read the books, and plenty of us have already played the incredibly cool <I>Lord of the Rings</I> board game designed by Reiner Knizia. And while the determined pluck of the hobbits is obviously worthy of admiration, haven't you ever thought there was something kind of cool about Sauron? Sure you might not want to admit it, or maybe you do, but the guy is in at least a partially sympathetic spot. He just wants to rule all of creation and to do that, all he needs to do is pry some jewelry away from a hobbit. With this Sauron expansion set to the original board game, players can get their chance to play the bad guy himself, employ the Black Rider, and rule them all. But beware: with this set, the pesky hobbits have some new weapons of their own. The set includes 30 Sauron cards, nine Nazgul cards, and five Fellowship cards.

Classic series knives were the first to feature Wusthof PEtec - Precision Edge Technology - for an easily maintained razor-sharp edge that retains its cutting performance twice as long as other knives. The attractive, ergonomic black handle is designed for comfort and control, and is made of a seamless, synthetic material for a hygienic grip. The handle is triple-riveted to the full-length tang for exceptional durability and the full bolster protects fingers from slipping. Cook's knives are indispensable kitchen helpers. They perform a wide variety of cutting chores, from mincing to dicing and slicing. The 5-inch blade of this definitive example provides sufficient heft to allow the knife rather than the cook to do most of the cutting labor; it's modest blade length makes it particularly useful for small chopping jobs, slicing, and cubing. Many people favor a cook's knife of this size because it combines the maneuverability of a paring knife with the strength and weight of a larger cook's knife. Part of the Classic series, the knife represents two centuries of unexcelled W&uuml;sthof craftsmanship. Like other cutlery in the series, it's hand-forged from a single piece of stainless steel for maximum strength; the hand-polished blade is exactingly calibrated to be hard enough to resist dulling yet soft enough to take a keen edge when it's honed or sharpened. Dishwasher-safe and with a traditionally shaped, ergonomically designed handle that is triple-riveted for durability, this knife brings a guaranteed lifetime of low-maintenance cutting to any cook who owns it. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>" COL title VAL "Wusthof Classic 5-Inch Cook's Knife" COL feature VAL "5-inch cook's knife for cutting, chopping, slicing, and dicing Precision forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel Full-tang, triple-riveted synthetic handle affords superior strength and balance Washing by hand recommended; made in Germany Measures approximately 11 by 3 by 1 inches; limited lifetime warranty" COL description VAL "4582-7/14  Features: -Blade Dimension 5''.-Forged From One Piece Of Specially Tempered High Carbon Steel To Ensure Outstanding Strength.-Extraordinary Sharpness Which Is Easy To Maintain.-Special Alloyed Steel.-Seamless, Hygienic Fit Of Handle.-Triple-Riveted, Full Tang Synthetic Handle.-Dishwasher Safe, But Hand-Washing Recommended.-Lifetime Guarantee.-Made in Solingen, Germany." 0.994880323761938

Otherwise Grand Prix knives are identical to other W&uuml;sthof knives, embodying all the virtues that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. The blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as on some knives. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. The four knives in this set exemplify control while providing a cook with the essentials: an 8-inch cook's knife (chef's knife) for rocking through chopping and mincing tasks; a 6-inch sandwich knife for myriad slicing and cutting needs; a 7-inch serrated bread knife for crusty loaves; and a 3-1/2-inch paring knife for fruits and vegetables. The set also includes a sharpening steel for keeping knife edges aligned, kitchen shears, and an oak block with three extra knife slots to store everything on the counter within reach.

Henckels Twin Pro S 6-Inch High Carbon Stainless-Steel Chef's Knife Cooks with small hands find this version of the classic French chef's knife fits. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish Pro S from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Pro S handles are heavier and its knives less weight-forward. The steel used in the Pro S line is identical to that of the Five and Four Star lines. High-tech welding of knives this size and larger combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel.

We hope you enjoy playing and learning together! Players work together to rescue the damsel in distress in the Princess Game. As players move their pieces around the board, they uncover tools such as a boat, key, or magic potion. These are used to get past six obstacles that guard the princess: a moat, a guard dog, a sentry, a locked door, a dark tunnel, and a magic spell. It's a race against time, because in addition to objects, the board contains spaces that advance the coming of the night and the end of the game. Cooperation comes into play when players help each other come up with creative uses for the various objects. The horse, for example, might be used to swim the moat or run past the dog, or might be traded to the guard as a bribe. Since all players are working toward a common goal, everyone wins or loses as a team."

An instruction book that accompanies the processor details how to process many common foods and troubleshoot problems so you know how to best use and care for your Mini Mate. <P>Cleanup and completion of small jobs is quicker and more efficient because of the small size, though the many parts of the Mini Mate require disassembly, careful cleaning, and reassembly, which does add to total cleaning time.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>" 0.9903849642677099

The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder?

Quickly measure and modify the six aquarium levels that are most important to the health of your freshwater fish with the API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT. To stay healthy and thrive, fish need properly balanced levels of ammonia, pH, high range pH, nitrite and nitrate. These levels can change rapidly and create harmful conditions when fish waste, uneaten food or other organic matter accumulate, or when untreated water is added. If left uncorrected, all of these can be harmful or even fatal to fish, with consequences such as reduction of oxygen, increase in stress and higher risk of disease. The API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT measures these six parameters with scientific accuracy and provides professional results. It comes with four glass test tubes, a holding tray, test tube rack and computer calibrated, laminated color card. Just fill the test tubes, add the test drops and compare results to the color card.

Proden plaqueoff animal does not rely on topical application or friction. The product is ingested and works systemically. The natural compound in the product comes out through the saliva and works to break down the bacterial biofilm that forms on the teeth and gums. This is how the natural bacteria in the mouth take hold onto the teeth and gums, colonizing and creating the oral problems of plaque and tartar, bad breathe and gingivitis. It does not change the ph of the mouth or kill off the normal levels of bacteria. Proden plaqueoff has been proven to reduce plaque and tartar on the teeth and gums, depending on composition, diet and how long it has been there. It then works to prevent bad breath, plaque and tartar from returning. Patients generally begin to see results over a 2-8 week period, and will see further benefits with continued use. Proden plaqueoff animal is made from a specific strain of selected seaweed harvested from above scandinavia. This seaweed has developed a natural defensive mechanism against bacterial biofilm. The product is made only from this seaweed and has no additives or chemicals added. It is human grade and human tested." 0.9887554392793361

With a patented reversible blade for sharp or blunt processing, and two speeds of operation, it is well equipped to handle a variety of jobs. <P>Though it has a high-speed motor and durable stainless-steel motor shaft, keep in mind that the Mini-Mate is designed for small amounts of food: 2 tablespoons is the maximum recommended for one batch, and food pieces should be no larger than 1/2 inch. Purchase it to complement, not replace, a larger, full-function food processor. An instruction book that accompanies the processor details how to process many common foods and troubleshoot problems so you know how to best use and care for your Mini Mate. <P>Cleanup and completion of small jobs is quicker and more efficient because of the small size, though the many parts of the Mini Mate require disassembly, careful cleaning, and reassembly, which does add to total cleaning time.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>" 0.991347449436927

High carbon, no-stain steel bl The thin, long blade of this set's knife makes any fine-slicing job a breeze. The fork's prongs are faceted rather than flat and are exceptionally attractive. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish the Pro S line from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Handles in the Pro S line are heavier and smaller, which makes the knives less weight-forward. The steel used in this line is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines, and the knives are constructed using the same technique. High-tech welding combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, giving the knife its distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Though traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, Henckels claims that the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel. These knives may be placed in the dishwasher, but hand washing is recommended. <I>--Fred Brack</I> <P> <B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/henck-pro-s-block.jpg </td> <td> The J.A.

Its curved, stainless-steel blade is perfect for rocking through chopping and mincing tasks; as a kitchen workhorse, the knife is also useful for cutting and slicing. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish Pro S from the company's other quality lines: TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Pro S handles are heavier and its knives less weight-forward. The Pro S line also has handles that are smaller; however, the line's steel is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines. High-tech welding of larger knives combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so this knife's parts have distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel. <I>--Fred Brack</I>" COL title VAL "ZWILLING J.A.

Near perfect in design, the pan is constructed of three layers of metal; two stainless steel outer layers with an aluminum core. The stainless steel exterior combined with the aluminum core allows the pan to be used on all types of stovetops, including induction, and heats the pan evenly to eliminate hot spots. Additionally, the pan has a non-stick coating which makes food removal and clean-up a breeze. The classically sloped sides help prevent messes, and when you're finished cooking, the pan can be hung through the handle's eyelet for convenient storage. Producing some of the finest cookware in the nation, All-Clad has been featured in many high class and gourmet restaurants for its superior performance and aesthetically designed pieces crafted from American artists using the finest metals. A firm believer in quality over convenience, All-Clad's metals are formulated and bonded with cooking performance in mind, and are combined with stunning designs to provide you with the best cooking experience possible. The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the steel. This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 10 inches in diameter, perfect for cooking tuna or tofu, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for a healthful meal. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's heat.

Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration.

Otherwise Classic knives are identical to other W&uuml;sthof knives, embodying all the virtues that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high- carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. With its long, narrow blade, this 10-inch knife neatly cuts the biggest ham into thin slices. It also can be used for roasts, poultry, and smoked salmon. Alternating hollows on each side of the blade create air pockets, allowing slices to fall away cleanly and permitting thinner slicing. Like all fine knives, it should be hand washed. <I>--Fred Brack</I>" 0.9923933278354766

I get used during the Christmas season. Have you guessed me yet?  From King Arthur to Kevin Costner, from Mt. Rushmore to Mars, you gradually reveal clues that help identify a well-known mystery topic. You don't need this board game to play 20 Questions, but it can make it more fun. This version  is a little more like 20 clues than 20 questions, though. Two to six players take turns advancing on the  14-inch-by-19-inch board. Each in turn draws one of 378 cards that bears 20 clues about a given person,  place, thing, or year. One player reads the clues, while the others try to guess just what those clues pertain  to. The first player to reach the Finish wins the game, and the fewer clues they need, the faster they go  forward. The same company, University Games, also makes 20 Questions for Kids and Travel 20  Questions. <I>--Rebecca Hughes</I>" COL title VAL "Stare!

Images are varied and fun for kids to look at. It might be a movie poster, funny photo, comic, work of art and more. When time is up, an opponent will flip over the card and ask the player a series of questions about the image to see how much they can recall. What was the clown holding in his left hand? What color is the girl's party hat? Guess right and advance on the game board. Kids can play individually or in teams. Great for family game night! The revised Second Edition has larger cards with all new images and questions. Includes image cards, game board, sand timer, playing pieces, die and instructions. Furrowed brows and hearty laughter are the most likely outcome of this fun but challenging game from Game Development Group. Just like its elder edition, the object of Stare! Junior is to be the first to reach the end of the game board. "Been there, done that," you're thinking? But in this game, looking hard and paying attention to detail are two things that will help players move forward. Individuals or teams stare at an image on a card for 30 seconds (more challenging games can be played by shortening the time) and then answer questions about what they saw. It's not easy--just try to remember what color socks the person next to you on the bus was wearing this morning, or how many people were reading magazines. Of course, you weren't staring... <I>--Rachel Radway</I>" 0.9039321177950062

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

The blade is constructed of ice-tempered and hardened stainless steel, and its edge stays sharp far longer than similar blades while resisting rust, stains, and corrosion. Put a Global knife in your hand and you'll notice its lightweight comfort and delightful balance, which is especially handy when slicing multiple fruits or veggies for a large gathering. The knife features thin blades and a hollow handle, and it should fit in many (if not most) knife blocks.

The SL-5411-GR features 150-degree motion detection at up to 70 feet with a metal housing for durability, and it uses two PAR38 flood bulbs (120-watt, not included). This model comes in gray, but it's also available in white. Studies show that light is the #1 deterrent to crime, and Heath Zenith's intelligent motion lighting fixtures help give the appearance of a startled homeowner turning on the lights to investigate what's going on outside. They also provide convenient illumination when you need it most, whether you're working outside at night or needing to see the steps more clearly to avoid a fall. Lights are activated when motion is detected, so there's no need to waste electricity by leaving the lights on all night. You can choose between three auto modes&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;1, 5, or 10 minutes of illumination after motion triggers the light. However, when constant light is needed, this motion-activated light has a manual override mode that allows it to function as switch-controlled light for constant on, dusk-to-dawn lighting. Heath Zenith uses superior pulse-count motion detection technology, which prevents false triggering by reading heat and movement in pulses as opposed to single occurrences. As a result, only substantial motion is detected, such as humans and animals. In addition to being Energy Star certified, this model meets California's Title-24 energy efficiency standards for residential and commercial buildings.

The synthetic handles feature classic three-rivet styling with full tangs for strength. The storage box is stained a rich auburn. It has brass hinges and snap closures and measures 15-1/4 inches long, 1-3/4 inches high, and 5-5/8 inches wide. The knives are dishwasher-safe and carry a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>" 0.9958337438789613

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM "tent cities" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, Eurekas new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition. For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Womens Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian. <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

The Flex-Bow tent is made of a superior, marine-grade, 100-percent cotton duck Hydra-Shield canvas.

Plus, you'll rarely--if ever--have to retreat Kodiak canvas.

The all-metal construction includes a heavy-duty motor to handle stiff batters and a hardwearing transmission that ensures continuous power. The mixers seamless, stainless-steel, 5-quart bowl stands flat on its indented base and features sealed handle and bracket connections that meet NSF standards.

The dough hook comes in handy for breads and coffee cakes, and the wire whip is your tool for icings and whipped cream. 4 sealed rubber feet hold the mixer stably in place, and a 3-wire, 6-foot power cord meets commercial requirements.

WaterDog senses your dog's approach, and automatically dispenses a cool, clean stream of fresh drinking water. Smart sonar sensing technology triggers the WaterDog to turn the water on when your pet comes within 3 feet (1 meter), and turns it off when your pet leaves. You'll never have to worry about what your dog's been drinking again. Constructed of durable, high-quality UV resistant materials, the WaterDog has been designed to provide many years of reliable service. The WaterDog's hose has a metal covering to protect it from chewing and to reflect heat to help keep the water cool, even on bright sunny days. The WaterDog is an automatic drinking fountain that is designed to give your pet direct access to fresh clean water, at any time. A sonar-based proximity sensor triggers the WaterDog to turn the water on when your pet comes within three feet (one meter), and turns it off when your pet leaves. Dogs quickly learn that they can always get a drink from the WaterDog. This greatly reduces the risk of your dog becoming dehydrated on a hot day, or developing disease from a contaminated water bowl. The WaterDog attaches easily, without tools, to any outdoor faucet, and the height is fully adjustable to suit any sized dog.

Adults who remember hours of fun building with the classic interlocking building logs construction set and want to introduce it to their own children may be dismayed to find that many such toys are now made of plastic. Never fear, T-N-T International can't quite let go of the past either. They have made this 114-piece Frontier Building set entirely out of quality hardwood. Beautifully cut and finished, it includes all the traditional pieces--long logs, short filler logs, and roof slats. Helpfully, T-N-T has made this set to be compatible with other log sets. <i>--Lisa Whipple</i>" 0.993371759731887

Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood.

Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary. This 9-1/4-inch square baker, crafted from commercial-grade  stoneware with Le Creuset's poterie glaze, cooks up a mean hot dish and  looks good doing it. Coated inside and out with the company's signature  enamel, the dish doesn't absorb moisture and resists chips, nicks,  stains, and odors. It's oven-safe to 500 degrees F and can also go in  the freezer, refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. It even looks  good at the table. The easy-grip side handles--ridged above and lipped  underneath--provide room enough for oven-mitt-sized fingers. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>" COL title VAL "Le Creuset Square Dish Bonus Bonus, White" COL feature VAL "Oven, Freezer, Microwave and dishwasher safe.
