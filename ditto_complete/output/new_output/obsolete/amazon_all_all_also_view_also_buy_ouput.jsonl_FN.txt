A tall, old-fashioned-looking blender, it will crush ice and blend frozen fruit beautifully in a few seconds. This blender feels sturdy: the lid, with a cap that doubles as a 1-ounce measurer, fits securely, and the pitcher, made of thick, ridged glass, won't wobble. Many chefs prefer a blender rather than a food processor for soups and creamy sauces--the blades of a good blender whirl more quickly than those of a food processor and will refine a thin liquid such as cream of tomato soup to an incomparably silky texture. This blender is definitely up to that task. The fixed, self-cleaning stainless-steel blades on the base of the pitcher mean the lid is the only separate part to wash."

Bandleader and inventor Fred Waring introduced the first blender in 1936; more than 60 years later the Waring blender remains the standard for the field. This one, a hardworking blender with a durable glass pitcher and a sturdy metal base, can quickly pulverize ice or pure a vichyssoise to creamy smoothness. The stainless-steel blade is removable on this model, and the plastic ring that attaches the blade to the pitcher feels a little light for such a heavy blender. Those in doubt might go with one of Waring's fixed-blade blenders. With a one-year appliance warranty, though, there's plenty of time to test this one out. <I>--Maria Dolan</I>" 0.8306628124081704

Select an EZ-clear Collar that is close in size to your pets regular collar. A properly fitted collar should have enough space to allow you to insert two fingers between the collar and your pets neck. Each EZ-clear Collar has unique Velcro strips on the side of the collar. Simply place the collar snugly, but not tight enough to choke, around the pets neck. Line up the Velcro strips to the properly positioned strip on the opposite side of the collar and press together. Adjust strips as necessary to get a comfortable fit. <br> <br> NOTE: Typically, pets require time to adjust to their EZ-clear Collar. Supervision is recommended. You may want to raise food and water dishes off the ground for easier access. <br> <br> CAUTION: Make sure that your pet cannot become stuck in tight places (under chairs, between furniture, etc.) If you have more than one pet, you should separate the pet with the EZ-clear Collar if left alone. Supervise all communal activity closely. <br> <br> REMEMBER: The EZ-clear Collar is not a toy. FOR CATS: Use indoors only. Supervise use." 0.8868130934598374
