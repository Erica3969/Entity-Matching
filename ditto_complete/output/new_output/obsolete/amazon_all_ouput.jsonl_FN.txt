To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains.

But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">In-Ground Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396711">In-ground systems</a> are permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease. Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">Wall-Mount Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396741">Wall-mount systems</a> can be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">Portable Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396731">Portable systems</a> require minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">Backboard Considerations</span></strong><br /> Regardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action. The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall.

The FBK-200 is a variable speed blower kit that includes a rheostat variable speed controller, but DOES NOT include a thermostat.

If no designated wall switch for the blower is present, the FBK-250 blower kit must be used. Another feature we've added to our FBK-200 kit is a galvanized mounting bracket.

But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide. <strong><font color=CC6600>In-Ground Systems</font></strong><br> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396711">In-ground systems</a> are permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease. Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system. <strong><font color=CC6600>Wall-Mount Systems</font></strong><br> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396741">Wall-mount systems</a> can be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list. <strong><font color=CC6600>Portable Systems</font></strong><br> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396731">Portable systems</a> require minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage. <strong><font color=CC6600>Backboard Considerations</font></strong><br> Regardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action. The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular. While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board.

The battery-powered design doesn't require an electrician; simply insert the included 9-volt battery, and the carbon monoxide detector is ready to go. The advanced electrochemical CO sensor detects carbon monoxide leaks from multiple sources, such as faulty fuel-burning appliances, blocked chimneys, and generators running inside or too close to homes. When CO levels become elevated, a loud 85-decibel alarm alerts you to the threat. Because CO evenly distributes itself, it's important to have a CO detector on every level and in every bedroom of your home. Designed to be simple to use, the CO detector has just one button that silences or tests the unit, as well as an end-of-life timer that lets you know when it's time to replace the device. Carbon monoxide (CO) is the leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in America, yet many people don't know they are suffering from CO poisoning until its too late. Since symptoms of CO poisoning are like the flu, you might not even know you're in danger at first. That's why a carbon monoxide alarm is an excellent way to protect your family. It can detect the CO you can't see, smell or taste in the air. The First Alert CO400 carbon monoxide alarm uses an electrochemical carbon monoxide sensor-the most accurate technology available. The permanent sensor lasts up to five years. It is powered by on 9V replaceable battery giving you peace of mind even during power outages. The test/silence button both silences the alarm and allows you to test its functionality. The unit monitors and re-alarms if carbon monoxide levels persist sounding a loud 85-decibel horn. No installation is required and the attractive design allows the unit to be placed anywhere you need it. It includes an optional wall mount with no outlet required. An audible and visual low battery signal alerts you to replace the battery. Pull down action chart has convenient guide on what to do if an alarm sounds. 5 year limited warranty.

Suitable for all living spaces and featuring a seven-year life, this alarm includes a snap-on cover that gives immediate access to the batteries, and the battery lockout system makes it difficult to close the cover when the batteries aren't installed. <b>About Carbon Monoxide: The Silent Killer</b><br>The leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in North America, carbon monoxide (CO) is often referred to as the silent killer because it's odorless, tasteless, and invisible. Carbon monoxide poisoning can come about via a number of sources, including everyday items and appliances in your home or office. And because symptoms of CO poisoning mimic the flu or other common illnesses it can often go undiagnosed. When placed on every level of your home, alarms like the KN-COB-B can help protect everyone in the house from experiencing prolonged exposure to CO by sounding an unmistakable signal indicating CO levels have reached an unhealthy point. <b>Continual Monitoring with Flashing LED and Alarm</b><br>The KN-COB-B provides continual monitoring of CO levels in your home. Its green LED will flash every 30 seconds to show that the unit is functioning properly. Should it detect elevated CO levels, its red LED will pulse, and a clearly audible alarm pattern will sound until the device is reset or the CO is eliminated. <b>Reliable Battery Operation</b><br>Because the KN-COB-B is battery operated, it provides constant protection--even during power outages--so you'll always have peace of mind. Its battery lockout system prevents incorrect placement of the batteries by not allowing the cover to close unless the batteries are placed correctly, and a snap-open cover makes for easy changes. The KN-COB-B also features a low battery signal so you know exactly when replacements are needed. <b>Compliancy and Warranty Information</b><br>The Kidde KN-COB-B alarm is UL-listed and is backed by a five-year limited warranty. <b>About Kidde: A UTC Fire and Security Brand</b><br>Renowned for global leadership in fire detection and suppression, Kidde provides solutions ranging from portable fire extinguishers to advanced industrial controls such as flame detection and explosion suppression systems.

We decided to make a high quality, old-fashioned edger with our patented O-handle grip because we wanted to be able to cut in a nice edge on a bed and maintain a nice trim appearance along the edges of our sidewalks and driveways. The Radius PRO Edger won't bend, makes no noise, requires no fuel other than elbow grease, and is actually much faster while producing better results than power edgers."

The extended reach design of our edger means you wont have to kneel or bend down to reach the borders of gardens and walkways like you would with traditional edgers. Since theres no gasoline, you wont be bothered by the noise, fumes and refueling hassles that come with power edgers. A steel blade with a sharp edge cuts cleanly through dense turf, a large foot platform makes it easy to maximize cutting force, and a dual-handle design provides comfortable use and enhanced control." 0.6171089068287672

Tighten the thumb screws firmly. Check to make sure the window sill is clean and completely dry. This step is very important to ensure proper bonding of fastening tape to the window sill. The fastening tape is intended to be placed on the window sill and it should be removed from the Window Perch at this time.

Bestselling, professional, aluminum telescoping pole saw - the pole saw of choice by professionals. The aluminum alloy extension poles are oval shaped, providing precise control over the direction of the blade (especially important for high cutting) and giving strength and rigidity to the pole thus reducing bending to the minimum. The base pole has a pole-end shock absorber and comfortable rubberized overgrip which ensures good hold and control. The 15-2/5-inch curved blade utilizes proprietary Silky 4-RETSUME (Four Rows of Teeth) Technology. Teeth are set in such a way that there appears to be 4 rows of them. Ideal for toughest pruning jobs! Blade can be adjusted to two different angles for lower or higher cutting and features an upper and lower sickle. The upper sickle is used to cut vines and lower sickle to undercut bark. Lower sickle provides clean cut without damaging tree, while upper sickle prevents blade from slipping off limb. HAYAUCHI is the finest telescoping pole saw available on the market today. Black rigid-plastic blade cover is included. Made in Japan.  To allow effective use of HAYAUCHI pole saws, two locking systems are incorporated to assure structural rigidity of the extended poles: 1) locking pins/buttons - the primary pole locking mechanism; and 2) friction clamps - the secondary pole locking mechanism. The two systems are designed to work together. This dual locking system allows 100% of the effort at the handle to be effectively transferred to the blade up to 21 feet away. Spring-loaded locking buttons allow multiple length adjustments and safety friction clamps hold the extensions firmly in place. Safety considerations require that the pole saw user must wear a hard hat and eye protection at all times.

Known for high quality innovation, Sprenger is located in Iserlohn, Germany.<br><br>SIZE NOTE | Herm Sprenger collars are made in metric measurements, then converted to rounded-up inches for the U.S. market.<br><br>SIZING | Measure dogs neck and add 2 inches. This is the initial collar size from which you adjust the collar by removing/adding links to achieve a comfortable, snug training fit. Manufacturer collar prong size recommendations for dog weight: 2.25 mm for up to 20 kg/44 pounds; 3 mm and 3.2 mm for up to 40 kg/88 pounds; 3.9 and 4 mm for up to 70 kg/154 pounds.<br><br>TRAINING COLLARS | Training collars are intended for supervised training sessions. Users should be informed and understand how to use training devices. Do not leave a dog unsupervised or alone in a training collar. Training collars are not intended for full time wear. Do not use retractable leash devices or elastic tension leads with a training collar. Recommended minimum dog age for training collar is 6 months.<br><br>KEEP YOUR COLLAR BALANCED | When adding/removing prong links, remember to keep the same number of prong links affixed on each side of the center plate. If the collar fitting requires an odd number of prong links, make sure one side of the center plate has only one more prong link than the other side. Your goal is to ensure the center plate stays at the front of the dog's neck above the trachea.<br><br>HOW TO CHOOSE PRONG LINKS | Prong Links can be purchased separately. When ordering, ensure you are ordering the correct millimeter sized prong link in the same metal composition as your collar. This will maintain a consistent tensile strength through out the collar, ensuring proper training communication and collar longevity.<br><br>CLEANING | Before use, wash metal collars in warm, mild soapy water to minimize fur discoloration."

Carry it wherever you go. Keeping your knife clean, dry, oiled and sharp are the primary defenses against corrosion, wear, and potential injury. Be sure to clean the blade and handle after each use--however, do not soak your knife in water. A mild solution of soap and water should remove any dirt and debris that may have accumulated during use (avoid harsh detergents such as laundry or dish soap, and chlorine products). After cleaning or after exposure to moisture be sure to completely dry your knife blade and handle, taking special care with any sensitive handle materials. Use a soft cotton cloth or chamois and a small amount of moisture-displacing oil (such as WD-40 or 3-in-1), on the blade only, to prevent water spots and oxidation from forming. Fingerprints and weather are the primary causes of rusting or corrosion on a knife blade. To keep your knife looking its best, SOG recommends that you give your blade a light coat of oil after each cleaning, and prior to long term storage.

Bestselling, professional, aluminum telescoping pole saw - the pole saw of choice by professionals. The aluminum alloy extension poles are oval shaped, providing precise control over the direction of the blade (especially important for high cutting) and giving strength and rigidity to the pole thus reducing bending to the minimum. The base pole has a pole-end shock absorber and comfortable rubberized overgrip which ensures good hold and control. The 15-2/5-inch curved blade utilizes proprietary Silky 4-RETSUME (Four Rows of Teeth) Technology. Teeth are set in such a way that there appears to be 4 rows of them. Ideal for toughest pruning jobs! Blade can be adjusted to two different angles for lower or higher cutting and features an upper and lower sickle. The upper sickle is used to cut vines and lower sickle to undercut bark. Lower sickle provides clean cut without damaging tree, while upper sickle prevents blade from slipping off limb. HAYAUCHI is the finest telescoping pole saw available on the market today. Black rigid-plastic blade cover is included. Made in Japan.  To allow effective use of HAYAUCHI pole saws, two locking systems are incorporated to assure structural rigidity of the extended poles: 1) locking pins/buttons - the primary pole locking mechanism; and 2) friction clamps - the secondary pole locking mechanism. The two systems are designed to work together. This dual locking system allows 100% of the effort at the handle to be effectively transferred to the blade up to 21 feet away. Spring-loaded locking buttons allow multiple length adjustments and safety friction clamps hold the extensions firmly in place. Safety considerations require that the pole saw user must wear a hard hat and eye protection at all times. Manufacturer Warning: Do not use aluminum telescoping pole saws around electrical power lines or equipment. Electrical shock may result. Incorrect use of the Silky pole saw may cause injury."

The Christmas cacti are tropical plants. They require sunlight and the blooms last longer with cooler temperatures. Keep them away from heaters, fireplaces, radiators, furnace ducts, and other heat sources. Place in a sunny location while indoors and if outdoors during the summer, find a place that has a sun/shade mix to prevent the plant from getting burned. <P>The best way to be sure your plant is getting just the right amount of water is to wait until the soil is dry on the top and still a bit moist toward the bottom. Then water the plant until the soil is saturated. Drain off any excess water that accumulates on the bottom. Then do not water again until the top half of the soil feels dry to the touch again. Well-drained soil is very important. A high quality cactus mix is great. If you can't find any that is made for cactus you can mix two parts regular potting soil with one part coarse sand. In order to insure your plant will bloom in time for Christmas, you will need to give the plant a rest period. Cut back on the watering leaving the soil only partly moist. Allow at least 14 hours of total darkness for the plant at night and sun during the day, until the buds begin to form. Start the dark period in early September. Once the buds form they can take from 10 to 12 weeks to fully bloom. After the Christmas cactus is done blooming you can prune it to incourage new growth. You'll also find that the plant will bloom better next year if it is trimmed. As new growth appears in the spring, put a diluted solution of liquid houseplant fertilizer 2 to 3 weeks after the start of the new growth.

So admired and respected was the design that it was declared to be the "most aerodynamically perfect pursuit plane in existence" by the Truman Senate War Investigating Committee in 1944. A highly maneuverable, turbo-powered aircraft with a maximum speed of 425 miles per hour, the P-51 Mustang had a remarkable success rate, especially in the European combat theater, destroying more than 5,000 German planes. First flown on May 20, 1941, the P-51 was modified at least seven times before production of this legendary aircraft ceased. Troughout the war, it was used extensively to completelow-altitude bombing runs, crippling enemy transport and disrupting their supply lines. Prior to the famous allied assault on the island of Sicily and the subequent invasion of the Italian peninsula, the P-51 cleared the way, ensuring allied success in what proved to be a major turning point in the war. This coin salutes the unmatched success of the P-51 Mustang, a combat aircraft without equal in the annals of aviaiton history.

In addition to providing excellent protection to the eyes and face after surgery, the Optivizor also works for general eye protection as it causes no discomfort or obstruction for the dog during use. Does not provide UV protection. Features The Optivizor is made from clear soft PVC the vizor is produced flat, and when assembled creates a contoured shape to fit your dogs features. It is assembled by the Vets when needed, using the easy assembly instructions. The Optivizor is available in a range of five sizes from Toy, Small, Small/Medium, Medium and Large The design incorporates a head rest which cushions and allows space between the Optivizor and the animals face allowing for greater air flow and comfort. Provision has been made to allow for adjustment by using the side straps which allow for an increase in head length and the chin strap can be adjusted to allow for greater head width. The Peel off lines on the snout of the Optivizor have been incorporated as an adjustment means for animals with a shorter snout. (Simply snip and peel off). The Optivizor has been designed to accommodate dogs with a Occipital Bone of Prominence The Optivizor has been designed to accommodate an easy one step process for medicating the patient.

The board is compatible with the following mounting brackets (sold separately): the Spalding 920312 extension arm and bracket for 4-inch square basketball poles or the Spalding 316 U-Turn adjustable extension arm and bracket for square basketball poles. The backboard carries a five-year warranty while the rim is backed by a one-year warranty. <strong>About Spalding</strong><br /> As a Division of Russell Corporation, the Spalding Group consists of three business units: Spalding in Springfield, MA; American Athletic, Inc. in Jefferson, IA; and Huffy Sports, in Sussex, WI. The three companies, collectively combined, are now the largest basketball equipment supplier in the world. Spalding is the official basketball supplier of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), the official backboard of the NBA and NCAA, the official volleyball of the King of the Beach Volleyball Tour and the official football of the Arena Football League (AFL) and Pop Warner. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;"><big>Amazon.com Basketball System Buying Guide</big></span></strong><br /> With the high-quality construction of many portable basketball systems, turning your driveway into a basketball court can be as simple as hooking up your garden hose. But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">In-Ground Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396711">In-ground systems</a> are permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease. Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">Wall-Mount Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396741">Wall-mount systems</a> can be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">Portable Systems</span></strong><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/?node=3396731">Portable systems</a> require minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage. <strong><span style="color: #cc6600;">Backboard Considerations</span></strong><br /> Regardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action. The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular. While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board.

1932, the story goes back further. The roots of the company can be found in Oates' entrepreneurial spirit. He and his brother used to farm the mountain areas of Bat Cave in western North Carolina. They would also help their mother find materials for her crafts. The sons began to make wooden whistles, buckets and bird-houses. They would sell their wares along with her crafts to the people from Charlotte that came through in their horse-drawn buggies on the way to the mountains. Later, Thomas worked at the Ashville Postcard Company. When the Depression hit, he lost his job, but it inspired him to go into business and sell crafts, like cornhusk dolls and woven pieces, that were produced by the local women. He had learned about the wholesale business while working at Ashville. He built a waterwheel to generate electricity at a mill, began making product and opened shop. Over the years, he expanded the company. His son, Lemuel Oates, who would next manage the company, says he worked in the business from a young age. He explains the products were made from cotton scraps left over from making socks. Half-inch circles would be looped together to form a variety of products. Lemuel Oates went to college and then settled in Richmond. In December 1973, he returned to Bat Cave and took over the company. In 2007 his son Travis and his daughter, Molly Oates Sherrill, took over the business."

We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to track to their original origins. <i>OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED</i> By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products. <i>FIBER QUALITY</i> What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell? <i>IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS</i> Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet. This means that each individual pellet is a blend. Most competitors merely blend different flavored pellets together in the bag. The problem with mixing different pellets together is each wood type burns differently making them harder for you to get a consistent smoke. With our blended pellet method, it ensures that each pellet burns the same for a more consistent smoke." COL title VAL "Lumber Jack 100-Percent Oak Wood BBQ Grilling Pellets, 40-Pound Bag (Discontinued by Manufacturer)" COL feature VAL "Non explosive Easy to carry safe to drop Not soaked in igniter's Non hazardous ignition 100-percent pure wood" COL description VAL "We are an actual manufacturing plant that uses real trees and processes them into our products. We are not a co-bagger that simply relies on another manufacturer that may use residue products impossible to tract to their original origins. A wood BBQ pellet is a small, 1-inch long, 1/4-inch diameter piece of hardwood. Because of their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8500 BTUs per pound. Wood pellets come in a wide variety of flavors ranging from hickory and oak to cherry, apple or maple. The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether you want a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can literallyturn the unit on, give it 10 to 15 mins to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.Automation is also greatwhen it comes to smoking. You can smoke for-Hour in a temperature controlled environment with little work from you. It is also virtually impossible to get a flare-up on a pellet grill. On high a pellet grill will consume about 2-pound per hour. This would be the temperature you grill steaks and burgers at. You probably wouldn't want to have the unit running for a full-Hour. On the smoke setting it will consume about 1/2-pound per hour so if you plan on smoking for 10-Hour you will use 5-pound of pellets.OUR BBQ WOOD PELLETS ARE TESTED By an independent testing laboratory. Our pellets are subjected to ash analysis/chemical composition tests along with the standard ash by weight and heat value testing criteria. We do this to ensure you the public that our pellets are comprised of only pure wood fiber. These tests are available upon request. Lumber Jack grilling pellets is leading the way to develop food grade BBQ wood pellets. You can trust your family's health protection to our products.FIBER QUALITY? What if a pellet maker using residual saw dust used some material that was OAK from ground oak pallets? What if the old oak pallets had antifreeze or chemicals spilled on the pallet and ground up into sawdust? Could you tell? Can the pellet mfg tell?IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN BBQ WOOD PELLETS Lumber Jack Wood pellets are made by blending the fiber prior to making the wood pellet so that each pellet in the bag is the pre-blended variety or flavor. Most competitors merely blend the pellets so that there are some oak pellets in the bag and some flavor pellets in the bag. Depending on how the individual specie pellet is packaged , blended before packaging or poured into the bag in layers or double stream filling, there can be pockets of either variety and depending on the length of burn you may think your using a blend in that particular burn you actually used all one flavor or the other. Fluctuating species may have different burn characteristics and fluctuate in long burns/smoking of changes in temp and smoke creation. With Lumber Jack BBQ Pellets you are assured that each pellet is consistently the correct mixture. This provides a much better quality control measure to ensure youre getting what you paid for. To some it makes no difference how they get a blend to us its a big deal with quality assurance consistency. We test the blend at the wood chip level and again at the ground fiber level and once again at the wood pelleted stage.BBQ WOOD FLAVOR WHAT GIVES THE WOOD A FLAVOR? Special metabolites, heaviest concentrations in cadmium/bark and knots These components endow woods with their many colors and hues, scents and beauty. An excellent suggestion for recognizing their roles and impact is to refer to these materials as ;special metabolites; (Gottlieb.1990)." 0.587765653006842

Walkaroo Balance Stilts Xtreme for advance stilt-walking quickly adjust to accommodate anyone from 4 6 to 6 6 (ages 6 and above). What makes them \"Xtreme?\" It's the adjustable walking height that takes you from the height of Original Walkaroo Stilts (5\" off the ground), WAY UP when you attach the included VERT LIFTERS. These Extensions allow experienced stilt walkers to walk even higher! They can be adjusted from 12 inches to a super-hight 17 inches off the ground! Geospace has made the classic stilts design a whole lot better... a whole lot easier to learn, easier to use, more ergonomically correct, and much more FUN! Traditional stilts are simply straight poles with foot platforms attached to the sides. Unfortunately, the tops of the poles rest uncomfortably behind the shoulders, which forces the upper body to slump forward and hinders balance. Not ours! Only Walkaroo Stilts have a patented \"S-bend\" which wraps comfortably around the back of your shoulders. Another bend at the foot platform places your weight directly over the lower pole for vastly improved control. Great for improving balance and coordination. Made of rugged tubular steel, with a non-marking rubber \"foot,\" which allows for use indoors and out. Steel construction. For ages 6 years &amp; up (to a maximum of 250 Lbs).

Reduces Scaling & Spalling, Maintains Traction." COL description VAL "PS101 is a chemically reactive deep penetrating siliconate sealer that fuses within porous substrates of concrete, brick, stone, exposed aggregate, and mortar to combat freeze/thaw damage, reduce scaling and spalling, impart water repellence, restrict moisture absorption, and limit harmful effects of deicing chemicals and salts, acid rain deterioration, alkali attack, corrosion of reinforcing steel, and UV damage. PS101 decreases efflorescence and dusting, limits dirt buildup and staining, retards mold and mildew, and makes easier to clean and maintain. PS101 is breathable with minimal impact to traction coefficient. PS101 creates a cross-linked insoluble methyl-silicone internal membrane that will wear away only if the substrate itself wears away below sealer penetration. PS101 enhances curing of new machine troweled concrete by allowing the slow release of moisture during the curing process while maintaining excellent breathability. PS101 is an excellent primer or moisture mitigation sealer for slab on grade floors by lowering hydrostatic moisture to promote adhesion of floor coatings, glues, and mastics. It is also UV resistant and nonyellowing. PS101 has a clear appearance. Upon proper application, the substrate will have little, or no, noticeable change in appearance when dry. It is recommended for curing new machine troweled concrete and for sealing existing concrete as well as masonry surfaces such as mortar, brick, block, stucco, natural stone, artificial stone, and exposed aggregate. It is ideal for sealing commercial and residential structures such as parking decks and structures, workshop floors, warehouse floors, automotive garage floors, retail store floors, restaurant floors, basements, garage floors, home and building exteriors, brick walls, chimneys, driveways, sidewalks, walkways, porches, steps, pool decking, patios, and brick or stone pavers.

COL description VAL "<b>The Magnetic Poetry Story</b><br><br>Dave Kapell, founder of Magnetic Poetry, was suffering from writer's block while trying to compose song lyrics. To overcome this problem, he wrote down interesting words on pieces of paper and rearranged them, looking for inspiration. What he hadn't figured into this experiment was his allergies. One good sneeze and any progress was sent flying across the room. Dave decided to glue the words to pieces of magnets and stick them to a pizza tin. Then he got hungry and the now magnetized words made their way to the refrigerator door. Before too long, Dave wasn't the only one rearranging his would-be song lyrics. When friends came over, Dave noticed they started to move the magnets around, amusing themselves by writing the first magnetic poems. <br><br> After seeing his friends having fun, Dave thought he might be able to sell his word kits at a local craft fair. He made up 100 kits and set up shop at Calhoun Square, a mall in the Uptown area of Minneapolis. All 100 kits were gone after 3 hours. That night, he recruited as many friends as pizza and beer could draw and made up more kits--all of which sold as rapidly the next day. <br><br> From these beginnings, Magnetic Poetry has now sold over three million word kits, over one billion word tiles--growing from the Original Kit to a kid's line of kits, to foreign language kits, to Voice/theme kits."

Or add some imagination and make something new. - The Engino Building System was invented by Costas Sisamos, a former teacher and engineer for the purpose of helping students build technological models creatively and easily to experiment and learn about science and technology in a way that includes all the benefits of play. Research grants from local and E.U. sources helped transition the three year research project into an innovative product. Since then Engino has developed more snap-fit components such as gears, pulleys, motots, and solar panels. The major advantage of the Engino system is that it's design flexibility enables children to build simple or complex models quickly using a small number of components."

It's the most versatile and durable tile for many reasons including its ability to withstand extreme and adverse elements. A striking look paired with easy maintenance makes Ribtrax the premier choice for commercial and residential applications alike - including garages, event floors, workshops, aircraft hangars, gyms, and patios in any climate condition. The overall strength and design of our Ribtrax tiles allows for heavy items such as rolling creepers, jack stands and tool boxes to sit or easily maneuver across the floor. Ribtrax, a 15.75" x 15.75" tile, can be mixed and matched in a design to give a brilliant customized design to any setting. Ribtrax's open profile above and advanced channel system below, allows for an easy-to maintain floor that facilitates optimum drainage underneath the tiles. The 0.75" height coupled with the cross-directional perforated design will also hide the undersurface of the tile beautifully. Peeling epoxy, chemical stains or just plain unsightly concrete becomes an image if the past. Installation: First, clean your sub floor so it is free of all dirt, grease or debris. You will interlock your tiles starting from one corner and moving to your right. After laying your first seven tiles, you will then move to the second row and begin interlocking from left to right until complete. NOTE: When piecing interlocking tiles together, adhesives are usually not used since the weight of the locked together product is usually enough to keep the floor tiles from moving. However, if you experience movement and would like to ensure the tiles do not slide, double-sided tape or mat tape can be used around the perimeter of the installation to prevent any movement. Maintenance is simple. Either use a shop van to pick up debris that rests on the surface of the tile, gently mop, or complete a light pressure wash."

Super Alloy 1 is a low temperature multi-metal solder that bonds all white metals at 350 degrees. Its honey flux turns root beer brown when the base metal has reached the proper working temperature, effectively acting as an exact temperature guide. Super Alloy 1 bonds at half the melting point of pot metal, enabling quick and easy repairs on classic cars and antique parts (such as pot metal pitting or broken pot metal pieces). It can also join white metals to practically any other metal, even ferrous to non-ferrous metals, like steel to aluminum. Super Alloy 1 can be applied with any heat source including a soldering gun, heat gun, or propane torch with no welding expertise.****************************************************** Note: Super Alloy 1 cannot be used to repair aluminum boats, cast aluminum, large aluminum masses, or diamond plate aluminum--Please use Super Alloy 5 and an oxyacetylene torch for these applications. If you have questions, please email prior to purchase, so we can direct you to the proper product and torch.

Shipping prices are determined by UPS and USPS directly, we do not determine their prices. Super Alloy 5 brazes aluminum at half the melting point of aluminum, with any torch: oxyacetylene, MAPP gas, natural gas, oxy-MAPP, or propane (parent metal MUST reach 600 degrees to flow rod. Oxyacetylene is required for large masses or thick aluminum--if you're unsure which torch you need, please email us before purchasing). The resulting bond is stronger than the parent metal (30,000 psi) and can be bent, drilled, anodized, machined, plated, tapped or threaded. Super Alloy 5 can be used to TIG weld all types of aluminum, and is especially effective with cast aluminum applications. Cast aluminum is a porous metal and can be difficult to weld without the proper tools. Super Alloy 5's powder flux chemically cleans cast aluminum, removes oil and impurities, and enables the welder to TIG weld aluminum without porosity or pinholes (using an oxyacetylene torch). Super Alloy 5 makes easy work of aluminum boat repair (using an oxyacetylene torch). ****************************** Note: An oxyacetylene torch is required for aluminum boats, cast aluminum, large aluminum masses, or diamond plate aluminum.

Because food and water are scarce in these barren landscapes, DESERT TRIBBLES can often go for days or weeks without eating or drinking, even going dormant for periods as long as three years. During the rainy season, the deserts bloom for a brief period of time. This is when the DESERT TRIBBLES revive and feast.

To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;IN.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended. Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do Not Use Steel Wool To Clean Your Track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains.

Arnie comes to life with 80 Dino sounds and phrases by the push of a button! Collect all of the Extreme InterAction Dinosaur Friends today and bring Dinosaur play to life like never before!. Product Features <div class="aplus"> Based on the Jim Henson PBS show, the Tomy Dinosaur Train InterAction Arnie Argentinosaurus figure allows your child, age three years and up, to bring their favorite Dinosaur Train character to life. This battery-powered dinosaur figure stands over 12 inches tall, and features over 80 dinosaur sounds and phrases that kids can control via a junior conductor wristband. With the press of a button, Arnie Argentinosaurus can sing, talk, walk, rear back and stomp. Combine him with other InterAction figures (sold separately) to experience additional phrases and actions. Tomy International InterAction Arnie Argentinosaurus is capable of speaking over 80 different phrases and songs. With the press of a button on his back, head, or jaw, Arnie comes to life with various sounds in the voice of a young boy. Whether he's calling everyone to the train station, roaring with excitement, or saying, "I'll weigh as much as 20 elephants someday," kids will enjoy the multitude of expressions. To conserve battery power, an on/off switch is located on the figure's underside. A junior conductor wristband enables kids to take control and interact with Arnie Argentinosaurus. This adjustable remote control, large enough to fit even an adult-size wrist, lets kids signal commands to trigger Arnie's sounds and movements. With the simple push of a button, kids can make Arnie walk, talk, sing, raise his front legs and stomp them down. When paired up with other InterAction dinosaur figures (sold separately), Arnie speaks unique sounds and phrases. Whether it's a new or existing InterAction figure, each dinosaur recognizes the other and addresses them by name, allowing kids to reenact their favorite storylines from the show, as well as create their own imagination-inspired adventures with creative interactivity. In testing Arnie Argentinosaurus, our testers found the figure to be impressively statured and detailed, faithfully representing the character as seen on Dinosaur Train. No doubt, kids will enjoy the hefty size and colorful appeal of this toy. While the numerous vocal sounds are also impressively rendered, commanding Arnie to perform them can be challenging. The wristband, in particular, is not always responsive to commands, even at extremely close range. Arnie's ability to walk is also somewhat underwhelming, as he generally only proceeds forward about a foot at a slow, clunky pace. Parents may also be annoyed that the figure occasionally comes to life with sounds, even when not actively being played with. Despite these deficiencies, Arnie Argentinosaurus is still an enjoyable toy for young children, especially fans of Dinosaur Train or those merely enthralled with dinosaurs.

The RC 30 & RC 23 feature a built-in light enclosed in the trailer winch casing to help secure your boat at night! Loading your boat into your trailer used to be a monumental hassle. You'd have to attach your manual winch and then summon all your physical strength to pull and crank your boat into place as it fought gravity. With the Powerwinch RC 23 wireless remote winch, however, loading your boat is as easy as pressing a button on the remote and relaxing in a lawn chair. The RC 23 is outfitted with such construction features as a corrosion-resistant, zinc-plated frame, an aircraft-quality cable, a level wind system to prevent cable snarls, and a UV-resistant ABS plastic housing. As a result, the smooth-running, heat-treated gear system inside the winch holds up against long-life wear and tear. The sturdy construction details help the winch pull a boat as heavy as 7,500 pounds. The RC 23 also offers a vertical lift capacity of 2,400 pounds, with an option for doubling the pull/line capacity with the use of a pulley block (included) at the bow eye. This doubles your cable and halves the retrieval speed, giving you more strength (4,300 pounds) out of your trailer winch. The RC 23 is powered via wireless remote, with remote power-in, freewheel-out operation. In addition, the RC 23 includes a couple of bonus features to help you out in a pinch, including a light enclosed in the trailer winch and an emergency crank conveniently stored in the winch cover.
