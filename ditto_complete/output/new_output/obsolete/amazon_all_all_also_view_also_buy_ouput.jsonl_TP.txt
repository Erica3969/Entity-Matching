It takes 17 monks to ring the 74-ton bell, 16 of them to raise the giant wooden hammer by pulling it away from the bell with hanging ropes, while the 17th monk rides the hammer, pushing off with his legs in the split second before impact. Ringing the massive bell is an important New Years event and the chiming lasts for 20 minutes. It only takes a gentle breeze to play the Woodstock Chimes of Kyoto and you will have years of pleasurable sounds reminiscent of the Japanese Koto, the musical instrument from which it gets its beautiful tuning.Over 30 years ago, Grammy award-winning musician and instrument designer Garry Kvistad created the first Woodstock Chime from an aluminum lawn chair he found in a landfill. Fascinated by the Scale of Olympos, a 7th century pentatonic scale that cant be played on a modern piano, Garry cut and tuned the lawn chair tubes to the exact frequency of the ancient scale. The resulting Chimes of Olympos was the first Woodstock Chime and is still one of our best selling, musically-tuned windchimes. Garry and his wife Diane founded Woodstock Chimes in 1979 and still develop the chimes today. It remains a family-owned business in New Yorks Hudson Valley."

COL title VAL "KONG - Ball with Hole - Durable Rubber, Fetch Toy" COL feature VAL "Measures 2.5-inches with hole drilled through center Ideal for small breeds Great toy for the dog who loves to fetch and chew Made in USA" COL description VAL "The KONG Ball is the best bouncing and most durable ball on the market. The perfect toy for the dog that loves to fetch and chew. Every dog needs a red rubber ball. What the discriminating dog needs, though, is a superior-quality Kong ball: high-bouncing, durable, and ready for rough-and-tumble play. Made from Kong's unique formulation of solid, puncture-resistant natural rubber, it won't pop, no matter how enthusiastic the game (or the player). Best of all, the Kong ball features an unbelievable, well-nigh irresistible bounce for epic games of chase and fetch, drop and pounce, and anything else your dog can think up. Measuring 4 inches in diameter, this ball is recommended for medium-sized breeds ranging from cocker spaniels to whippets. Satisfaction is guaranteed; if either you or your dog aren't happy with your purchase, return within 30 days for a full refund. <i>--Mary Park</i>  " COL title VAL "KONG Stuff-A-Ball Dog Toy" COL feature VAL "Use as a fetch stick that's both safe and reliable Helps clean teeth and soothe gums Made in the USA.

The best of all possible worlds: the Kong Stuff-a-Ball is a treat dispenser, a wild-bouncing rubber "ball," and a dental cleaning device all in one. Made from the same super-durable, puncture-resistant, non-toxic rubber as classic Kong toys, it's designed to hold treats that dispense as a dog rolls the ball, chews, and plays. Wedge biscuits into the center ports and smear peanut butter or Kong brand Stuff 'N Pastes in the crevices, and extracting the contents becomes a "hunt" to keep any pooch happy and busy for hours while their owner's away. For the pooch with separation anxiety or problem behaviors, chewing on a Stuff-a-Ball provides boredom prevention, stress relief, and intellectual stimulation while she's home alone. Not to mention the dental benefits: the Stuff-a-Ball's ridged exterior grooves gently "squeegee" teeth and gums clean, helping prevent plaque and tartar buildup (not to mention canine halitosis). Try smearing doggy toothpaste (or Kong Stuff 'N Breath Treat) into the exterior grooves to motivate your dog to chew and freshen her breath at the same time. Best of all, the irregularly shaped design produces a goofy, unpredictable bounce that will keep your dog's attention far longer than a conventional round ball. Measuring three inches in diameter, this Stuff-a-Ball is recommended for small- to medium-sized breeds like beagles, cocker spaniels, and pugs. Regularly inspect your ball for cracks or missing chunks, and replace worn or damaged toys to avoid a choking hazard.

Includes a special rack for cooking several foods at once with no intermingling of flavors. Dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. Liquid capacity: 4 quarts (3.8 liters). Pressure cookers have experienced renewed popularity over the last several years because cooks have rediscovered what some cooks (particularly grandmas) have known for a long time--they're really fast. And it's easy to cook healthfully with pressure cookers, since the food retains so much more of its nutrients and flavor.

Chicken Cacciatore cooks in 8 minutes! This durable, polished-aluminum pressure cooker is an economical addition to any well-rounded set of kitchen tools. The heavy-duty lid locks down during cooking; an inner sealing ring keeps the steam in. In addition to a pop-up pressure indicator and a simple steam release mechanism, there is an overpressure plug that will let off steam if it builds up excessively. This pressure cooker is useful for weeknight dinners or for any meal that needs to come together quickly. An accompanying booklet contains more than 65 recipes, ranging from basic soup stocks to stews and pot roast--even desserts like Oatmeal-Apple Crisp!

Nonabrasive cleansers are best for cleaning this polished aluminum pressure cooker, though occasional use of a fine metal polish will help the exterior keep its shine. The Presto 4-quart aluminum pressure cooker is fully immersible; in addition, the sealing ring should be removed after each use to allow cleaning of the inside rim of the lid.

The pressure cooker measures 9 inches in diameter (14 inches including handle) and 7 inches tall (including lid). Presto guarantees this pressure cooker with an extended 12-year warranty.

COL title VAL "Cuisinart MM-2M Mini Mate Chopper and Grinder" COL feature VAL "9-ounce transparent bowl High-speed motor with 2 speeds Reversible blade for precision chopping and grinding Dishwasher-safe parts Chopping/grinding blade" COL description VAL "Cuisinart Mini Mate Chopper/Grinder The Mini-Mate makes quick work of small kitchen prep jobs that might otherwise require difficult and messy chopping, grinding, and grating: nuts, nutmeg, and cinnamon sticks, peppercorns and seeds, garlic and anchovies, even chocolate and citrus peel. With a patented reversible blade for sharp or blunt processing, and two speeds of operation, it is well equipped to handle a variety of jobs. <P>Though it has a high-speed motor and durable stainless-steel motor shaft, keep in mind that the Mini-Mate is designed for small amounts of food: 2 tablespoons is the maximum recommended for one batch, and food pieces should be no larger than 1/2 inch. Purchase it to complement, not replace, a larger, full-function food processor. An instruction book that accompanies the processor details how to process many common foods and troubleshoot problems so you know how to best use and care for your Mini Mate. <P>Cleanup and completion of small jobs is quicker and more efficient because of the small size, though the many parts of the Mini Mate require disassembly, careful cleaning, and reassembly, which does add to total cleaning time. If you don't have the time or the patience for smaller detail-oriented prep jobs, Mini Mate is a great kitchen aid. <I>--Emily Wolf</I>" COL title VAL "Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep Food Processor, White" COL feature VAL "Great for chopping, mixing, pur&#233;eing, and grinding small portions Two speeds; 21-ounce capacity Patented reversible stainless-steel chopping/mixing blade Durable, dishwasher-safe bowl and cover 18-month warranty" COL description VAL "DLC1  Features: -Powerful chopper/grinder.-White Base.-21-ounce work bowl.-2 speeds for precision processing.-Patented reversible blade.-Dishwasher-safe parts.-Stainless steel blade with sharp and blunt edges.-Spatula.-Instruction/Recipe Book. Dimensions: -Overall Dimensions: 8.25''H x 6.9''W x 5.2''D. Warranty: -Limited 18-month warranty. The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>" 0.9375547143860159

Otherwise Classic knives are identical to other W&uuml;sthof knives, embodying all the virtues that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high- carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. With its long, narrow blade, this 10-inch knife neatly cuts the biggest ham into thin slices. It also can be used for roasts, poultry, and smoked salmon. Alternating hollows on each side of the blade create air pockets, allowing slices to fall away cleanly and permitting thinner slicing. Like all fine knives, it should be hand washed. <I>--Fred Brack</I>" 0.9625676956479489

The food and water cups should be cleaned and re-filled daily with fresh water and fresh seeds to keep your pet bird healthy. Breeding parrots need extra protein to trigger reproductive hormones and ensure a healthy egg production. The female also requires more nutrients in her diet when rearing young because she is eating for more than just herself! While fledgling or juvenile parrot species do reach the outward appearance of an adult by the time they are weaned, their bodies on the inside are still developing and do benefit from a little extra &lsquo;punch&rsquo; of nutrients during this stage of their life. Achieve greater weaning success during this stressful time by spoon feeding warm, softened Tropican High Performance Weaning Diet when making the transition from syringe feeding to solid foods. If the babies are fed Tropican Hand Feeding Formula, they&rsquo;ll quickly recognize the same flavor and adapt to eating the softened Tropican on their own. It is suggested to feed Tropican High Performance Tropican Weaning Diet for the first six months after weaning for most parrot species, and up to nine months for large macaw species. Parrots that have been eating a primary diet of traditional parrot seed mix need a little boost to their amino acid profile, as well as other essential nutrients. They&rsquo;ve been getting all the fat they need, perhaps too much. But, they are not getting a complete amino acid profile; therefore, they haven&rsquo;t been getting the right protein.

The female also requires more nutrients in her diet when rearing young because she is eating for more than just herself! While fledgling or juvenile parrot species do reach the outward appearance of an adult by the time they are weaned, their bodies on the inside are still developing and do benefit from a little extra &lsquo;punch&rsquo; of nutrients during this stage of their life. Achieve greater weaning success during this stressful time by spoon feeding warm, softened Tropican High Performance Weaning Diet when making the transition from syringe feeding to solid foods. If the babies are fed Tropican Hand Feeding Formula, they&rsquo;ll quickly recognize the same flavor and adapt to eating the softened Tropican on their own. It is suggested to feed Tropican High Performance Tropican Weaning Diet for the first six months after weaning for most parrot species, and up to nine months for large macaw species. Parrots that have been eating a primary diet of traditional parrot seed mix need a little boost to their amino acid profile, as well as other essential nutrients. They&rsquo;ve been getting all the fat they need, perhaps too much. But, they are not getting a complete amino acid profile; therefore, they haven&rsquo;t been getting the right protein. Tropican High Performance is made with ground sunflower meat and peanut kernel, a flavor those seed junkies will be sure to recognize and relish!" 0.9848401390558006

Gandalf the Grey has 12 points of articulation and great detailing and  facial sculpt. He has a removable robe and comes with Glamdring and staff. His  hat sits snugly on his head, so he won't have to chase it when a gust of wind   comes along. One of the neatest features is his light-up staff: his left hand  has several metal connectors that cause the staff to be raised and light up when  a lever on his back is pressed. The connectors are a bit finicky and not  necessarily seated well, but careful handling should solve any major technical  difficulties. The ball joints in the shoulders allow for a wide range of arm  movement; the paint detail is clean; and the easily removable cape is flexible  and does not detract from the clean lines of the figure. This will make a  wonderful gift for any Tolkien fan (not to mention for anyone into just plain  cool toys). <I>--A. Galindo</I>" 0.9860979413749406

These precision scissors are commonly used in the west for pruning, but are perfectly suited for fine fabrics, general use and bonsai trimming. These are heirloom quality scissors that will last for years. In a recent enhancement, a length of quality tubing has been added to the handles as padding to prevent any soreness to your hands with continuous use. These cushions are not glued on and can be cut off if preferred. About this 350 year old company: Zhang Xiaoquan opened its doors during the Qing dynasty during Emperor Kangxi?s reign in 1663 AD. The brand was designated for imperial use in the Qing Dynasty court and got a special award from Emperor Qianlong. The crafting of these scissors require processes that evolved over three centuries: high-quality steel is set into wrought iron which is then forged and hammered into cutting edges. Next the edges are finely ground with mineral rich mud bricks from the area. You'll find the action to be smooth and sure. The company has received awards for excellence at the Southern Coast Industrial Exposition in 1910, the 1915 Panama Pacific Imitational Exposition and the 1926 Expo in Philadelphia. The age-old forging techniques of Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors have been included in the list of China's intangible cultural heritage. The package includes a sheet with this history and more information.

Near perfect in design, the pan is constructed of three layers of metal; two stainless steel outer layers with an aluminum core. The stainless steel exterior combined with the aluminum core allows the pan to be used on all types of stovetops, including induction, and heats the pan evenly to eliminate hot spots. Additionally, the pan has a non-stick coating which makes food removal and clean-up a breeze. The classically sloped sides help prevent messes, and when you're finished cooking, the pan can be hung through the handle's eyelet for convenient storage. Producing some of the finest cookware in the nation, All-Clad has been featured in many high class and gourmet restaurants for its superior performance and aesthetically designed pieces crafted from American artists using the finest metals. A firm believer in quality over convenience, All-Clad's metals are formulated and bonded with cooking performance in mind, and are combined with stunning designs to provide you with the best cooking experience possible. The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the steel. This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 10 inches in diameter, perfect for cooking tuna or tofu, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for a healthful meal. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's heat. Although Stainless cookware is dishwasher-safe, nonstick pieces should be hand washed. <i>--Fred Brack</i> <b>From the Manufacturer</b> <br> <b>All-Clad Stainless Construction</b> <br> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cookware/allclad.stainless.gif" width="244" height="129" align="left"> Each piece of All-Clad cookware features a unique metal bonding construction.

Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

From colonial hearth fires to the campfires of Lewis and Clark, cast iron camp ovens fed the colonists, helped tame the wilderness, and did their share in settling the American West. Cast iron cookware has long been treasures as sought after heirlooms, so much so that, when Lewis and Clark returned from their journey west, their trusted cast iron pots were among the few items making it back to civilization. Like whiskey and tall tales, Lodge Cast Iron improved with age. There are few companies who can boast that products they made over 100 years ago remain in use today, and are still in high demand. You just won't find anyone who knows camp oven cooking like Lodge. Our camp ovens have proven themselves with avid outdoorsmen and patio pioneers from Tennessee to Tokyo. When you create a meal in Lodge Cast Iron, you create a memory that lasts a lifetime. Many of the pieces of cast iron cookware made in the Lodge Foundry over a century ago remain in use today.

The right tool for searing, sauteing, simmering, braising, baking, roasting, and frying. Cast-Iron is a form of cookware developed over a millennia ago remains as popular today as when it was used to prepare meals hundreds of years ago. Cast Iron is one of only two metals compatible with induction stovetops. Unparalleled in heat retention and even heating. At home in the oven, on the stove, on the grill or over the campfire. Skillet may be used on various heat sources including gas, electric and induction. Seasoned cast iron can also be used on the grill or open fire and coals for camp cooking. Begin heating cookware on low and slowly bring heat up to medium or medium/high. Always remove cookware from the stovetop after cooking. Seasoned for a natural, easy-release finish that improves with use. Seasoning is a necessary step in using cast iron cookware. Oil is baked into the pores of the iron at the foundry to prevent rusting and to eventually provide a natural, non-stick cooking surface. Unlike synthetically coated cookware, it is possible to restore the cooking surface of cast iron. Lodge uses a proprietary soy-based vegetable oil to season our cookware. The oil contains no animal fat or peanut oil. The seasoning is functional application and slight inconsistencies may appear in the seasoning finish. The inconsistencies will not affect cooking performance. Easy: hand wash, dry, rub with cooking oil. It is very important to replenish the seasoning of your cast iron cookware by applying a thin layer of oil after each cleaning. Seasoning is an on-going process. The more you use cast iron, the seasoning is improved. Rinse with hot water (do not use soap), and dry thoroughly. Before cooking, apply vegetable oil to the cooking surface of your pan and pre-heat the pan slowly (always start on low heat, increasing the temperature slowly). Once the utensil is properly pre-heated, you are ready to cook. TIP: Avoid cooking very cold food in the pan, as this can promote sticking. PLEASE REMEMBER: Handles will become very hot in the oven, and on the stovetop. Always use an oven mitt to prevent burns when removing pans from oven or stovetop. After cooking, clean utensil with a stiff nylon brush and hot water. Using soap is not recommended, and harsh detergents should never be used. (Avoid putting a hot utensil into cold water. Thermal shock can occur causing the metal to warp or crack). If you are having trouble removing stuck-on food, boil some water in your pan for a few minutes to loosen residue, making it easier to remove. Towel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to the utensil while it is still warm. TIP: Do not let your cast iron air dry, as this can promote rust. Store in a cool, dry place. If you have a cover, or lid, for your utensil, place a folded paper towel in between lid and utensil allowing air to circulate. This prevents moisture from collecting inside the utensil, which can cause rust. TIP: The oven is a great place to store your cast iron; just remember to remove it before turning on the oven. NEVER wash in dishwasher. If for some reason your utensil develops a metallic smell or taste, or perhaps rust spots (maybe a well-meaning relative washed your utensil in the dishwasher or with soap thinking they were being helpful), never fear. Simply scour off the rust using a very fine grade of sandpaper or steel wool and refer to our section on re-seasoning. While maintaining the seasoning should keep your Cast Iron in good condition, at some point you may need to repeat the seasoning process. If food sticks to the surface, or you notice a dull, gray color, repeat the seasoning process: Wash the cookware with hot, soapy water and a stiff brush. (It is okay to use soap this time because you are preparing to re-season the cookware). Rinse and dry completely. Apply a thin, even coating of MELTED solid vegetable shortening (or cooking oil of your choice) to the cookware (inside and out). Place aluminum foil on the bottom rack of the oven to catch any dripping. Set oven temperature to 350 &#xFFFD; 400 degrees F. Place cookware upside down on the top rack of the oven. Bake the cookware for at least one hour. After the hour, turn the oven off and let the cookware cool in the oven. Store the cookware uncovered, in a dry place when cooled. For over 112 years, Lodge has provided quality cast iron cookware and accessories, with a broad and innovative assortment. Our continued commitment to quality enables Lodge to offer a superior product line. We measure from outside rim to outside rim across the top of the cookware, not the bottom. We recommend using wood or silicone utensils to avoid scratching. Soap and detergent are used to break down and remove oils. Since the seasoning of your cast iron consists of oil, cleaning with soap will strip or remove the seasoning from cookware. Foods which are very acidic (i.e. beans, tomatoes, citrus juices, etc.) should not be cooked in a cast iron utensil until the cookware is highly seasoned. The high acidity of these foods will strip the seasoning and result in discoloration and metallic tasting food. Wait until cast iron is better seasoned to cook these types of foods. Lodge is a zero hazardous waste stream foundry. Lodge designed a vegetable oil recycler for the seasoning process to reduce waste and unusable oil is recycled and used as biodiesel generator. Lodge uses recycled and biodegradable packing materials. Reuse of foundry sand used in the casting process is recycled and unusable sand, working to purify the water of the local streams and planting trees to improve air quality and beautification. Lodge is the oldest family-owned cookware foundry in America. Since 1896, the Lodge family has been casting premium iron cookware at their Tennessee foundry. Starting with raw materials and finishing with their seasoning process, they continue to improve on the highest quality standards that go into every piece we make. As the sole American manufacturer of cast iron cookware, they are proud to carry on the legacy started by founder Joseph Lodge. Lodge doesn't just make cast iron; they make heirlooms that bring people together for generations."

The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. To ensure an ideal cutting angle, the laser-controlled edge is incredibly sharp and is honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans. The three-rivet handle embedded with the ZWILLING J.A. Henckels logo provides optimum durability. This knife block set carries a useful assortment of standard knives for outfitting a kitchen. The set includes a 2-1/2-inch peeling knife, a 4-inch paring knife, a 5-inch serrated utility knife, a 6-inch utility knife, and an 8-inch chef's knife, as well as a 7-inch hollow-edge santoku, an 8-inch bread knife, and a 4-1/2-inch steak knife. A 9-inch sharpening steel keeps their edges in order, and a pair of kitchen shears to snip herbs, flowers, or string is also included. Everything stores neatly in the attractive natural hardwood block. The knives feature high-carbon, stainless-steel blades that have been stamped from one piece of metal. The edge is cut by laser for a more consistent angle on the blade and hand-honed for sharpness. Blades have also undergone Henckels's Friodur ice-hardening process, which further strengthens them and protects from discoloration. The ergonomically designed traditional-style polymer handles are securely fastened to the balanced full tangs with three rivets. Handles seamlessly encase the tangs on these knives so no food particles can ever become trapped in a gap.

COL title VAL "Makita LS1212 12-Inch Dual Rail Slide Compound Miter Saw with Carbide-Tipped Blade" COL feature VAL "Powerful 15 amp motor handles all materials Electronic speed control maintains blade speed regardless of load Miters up to 60 degrees right with positive stops at common angles Bevels at 45 degrees to both sides--right and left Package includes a carbide-tipped blade" COL description VAL "Riding on a horizontal double-rail system, Makita's 12-inch dual sliding compound miter saw delivers all the cutting capacity a miter saw can give. The saw crosscuts up to 12-1/4 inches, handling two-by-twelves with ease. With a 3-7/8-inch maximum depth miter cut, the saw also cuts four-by-four material in one pass--a feature deck builders, in particular, will appreciate. Both rails are self-cleaning and ride on linear ball bearings. The horizontal rail design also seems to give this saw some extra stability, a feature that's particularly important in a 12-inch saw that bevels to 45 degrees both ways. Makita's saw has a vertical grip design with a thumb-activated safety switch and a paddle trigger, and while the vertical design might be slightly less ergonomic than the horizontal D-handle, it does allow you to use the saw comfortably with either hand. Plus, the paddle grip makes squeezing the trigger easy no matter how you're holding the handle. The saw's nine positive stops make it easy to lock in common miters, too, and they're deep-cast into the body of the saw, so it's hard to imagine they'd ever develop slop. The miter lock on this saw has an older screw-handle design, which is a little more time-consuming than a new (more expensive) cam-lock design. We really like the electric brake, though, a user-friendly feature that makes a big difference, especially when a job requires a lot of constant, repetitive cuts. The pivot fence adjusts for supporting large stock and flips back for bevel cuts. The saw also comes with a well-designed work clamp that lets you make precision cuts on small pieces without having to get your fingers too close to the blade. Like most sliders, this saw features a depth-stop mechanism in case you have to make a few quick dado cuts on a job site. And, for home shop users, this saw has the added option of a release safety button that pulls out and locks the saw off. <I>--Jon Groebner</I> This Dual Rail Slide Compound Saw from Makita is efficient and precise. Its two-pole, linear, ball-bearing-mounted, sliding cutting head ensures the ultimate in cutting accuracy. It performs precision bevel cutting up to 45 degrees, both left and right, and miters up to 60 degrees right. It has positive stops at 15, 22.5, 30, and 45 degrees left and right.

Spring-loaded locking buttons allow multiple length adjustments and safety friction clamps hold the extensions firmly in place. Safety considerations require that the pole saw user must wear a hard hat and eye protection at all times. Made in Japan.

COL description VAL "This lightweight, professional-grade telescoping pole saw features a 13" blade with 6.5 teeth per inch. The precision-ground, razor sharp teeth feature four cutting angles to ensure fast, clean, smooth cutting. In addition, the taper-ground profile reduces drag and directs more usable energy to the cutting edge. Oval-shaped aluminum alloy extension poles provide precise blade control, vitally important for high cutting. The base pole features a pole-end shock absorber and a comfortable rubberized overgrip. The Zubat utilizes two locking systems to provide superior structural strength. Spring-loaded locking buttons allow for multiple length adjustments, and safety friction clamps hold the extensions securely in place. Limited lifetime warranty from the manufacturer.

Incorrect use of the pole saw may cause injury. Lightweight, PROFESSIONAL-grade aluminum telescoping pole saw - the pole saw of choice by professionals. The aluminum alloy extension poles are oval shaped, providing precise control over the direction of the blade (especially important for high cutting) thus reducing bending to the minimum. The base pole has a pole-end shock absorber and comfortable rubberized overgrip. The 13-inch impulse-hardened curved blade utilizes proprietary Silky MIRAI-ME (Smooth Cutting) Technology - The Teeth of the Future! The precision-ground, razor-sharp teeth with four cutting angles provide fast, clean and extremely smooth cutting action. Blade thickness is 1.5mm. The taper-ground profile reduces drag and directs more usable energy to the cutting edge. It is ideal for pruning branches at higher position without ever climbing a ladder. Black rigid-plastic blade cover is included. To allow effective use of ZUBAT pole saws, two locking systems are incorporated to assure structural rigidity of the extended poles: 1) locking pins/buttons - the primary pole locking mechanism; and 2) friction clamps - the secondary pole locking mechanism. The two systems are designed to work together. This dual locking system allows 100% of the effort at the handle to be effectively transferred to the blade up to 21 feet away. Spring-loaded locking buttons allow multiple length adjustments and safety friction clamps hold the extensions firmly in place. Safety considerations require that the pole saw user must wear a hard hat and eye protection at all times. Made in Japan. Manufacturer Warning: Do not use aluminum telescoping pole saws around electrical power lines or equipment. Electrical shock may result. Incorrect use of the Silky pole saw may cause injury.

Includes game board, 16 dinosaurs, 72 cards, 5 dice, and 3 levels of play. The Dino Math Tracks game (winner of several prestigious awards, including an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Seal) is a race around the rainbow with a pack of pintsize, prehistoric pals. An unusual spin on a typical roll-the-dice-and-move game, it spotlights the mathematical concept of <i>place value</i> and gives kids reinforcement in what makes our base-10 number system tick. Each player is allotted one dinosaur for each of the four tracks (the tracks are labeled 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s). To play, a player rolls four dice to create a 4-digit number and then moves his or her prehistoric posse to the appropriate 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s places. Problem-solving strategies are honed as players scurry to get all four miniature mammoths or tiny triceratops into the dino haven, ahead of the other players' thundering herds. But look out! In the race to dino utopia, it's easy to get bumped by a baby brachiosaurus! The Dino Math Tracks game provides multiple levels of play for a variety of ages. At the simplest level (perfect for a first-grader who knows Arabic numerals and one-to-one correspondence), kids use only the place track for the 1s. Later, cards with simple problems are introduced ("Stuck in a tar pit! Move your 10s dino back two spaces!"). At the most advanced level, players might encounter a question like this: "Your 10s dinosaur forgot its pants, so it went back 15 to get them. Then it hurried forward 25. How far did it get? Move that many." Young players will find the 2-inch, spunky vinyl dinosaur playing pieces irresistible.

Scientifically designed with eight grains and nuts, plus a special blend of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, Tropican helps maintain healthy weight levels and enhances plumage. <b>Tropican Lifetime Maintenance Cockatiel Granules</b> is a scientifically formulated, completely balanced and flavorful maintenance diet for all Cockatiels, Lovebirds, Rosellas and Parrotlets. The extruded 2 mm granules are sized to be eaten easily, decreasing waste. Tropican was developed and researched by the Hagen Avicultural Research Institute (HARI) and earns the HARI Seal of Approval. For over two decades, the HARI Flock has been fed exclusively Tropican Formulated diets! Tropican comes in a variety of extruded formulas and sizes to appeal to a variety of birds needs. The Tropican formulated diets includes: Ample fresh food and water should always be available to satisfy the demands of your pet bird. The food and water cups should be cleaned and re-filled daily with fresh water and fresh seeds to keep your pet bird healthy. Breeding parrots need extra protein to trigger reproductive hormones and ensure a healthy egg production. The female also requires more nutrients in her diet when rearing young because she is eating for more than just herself! While fledgling or juvenile parrot species do reach the outward appearance of an adult by the time they are weaned, their bodies on the inside are still developing and do benefit from a little extra &lsquo;punch&rsquo; of nutrients during this stage of their life. Achieve greater weaning success during this stressful time by spoon feeding warm, softened Tropican High Performance Weaning Diet when making the transition from syringe feeding to solid foods. If the babies are fed Tropican Hand Feeding Formula, they&rsquo;ll quickly recognize the same flavor and adapt to eating the softened Tropican on their own. It is suggested to feed Tropican High Performance Tropican Weaning Diet for the first six months after weaning for most parrot species, and up to nine months for large macaw species. Parrots that have been eating a primary diet of traditional parrot seed mix need a little boost to their amino acid profile, as well as other essential nutrients. They&rsquo;ve been getting all the fat they need, perhaps too much. But, they are not getting a complete amino acid profile; therefore, they haven&rsquo;t been getting the right protein. Tropican High Performance is made with ground sunflower meat and peanut kernel, a flavor those seed junkies will be sure to recognize and relish!" 0.9893680535516259

Family Games is committed to selling safe, creative games of the highest quality. Our products are manufactured using environmentally safe and socially responsible methods. All the wood used in manufacturing was either from surplus wood from furniture factories or farmed trees from re-growth forests. Just as it is in a modern metropolis, space is at a premium in the game of Cathedral. This game is a developer's dream! Cathedral challenges two players to place as many buildings as possible within the walls of a medieval city. There are two sets (light and dark) of hardwood buildings of various sizes. To begin the game, one player places the cathedral on the grid of the walled city. Then the two players vie for the remaining land. Their goal is to place their own buildings while thwarting their opponent's land-grabbing tendencies. If a player can completely surround one of his/her opponent's buildings, that building is removed from the board and the space gobbled up by a different building. The game ends up resembling a puzzle that must be thoughtfully pieced together. The winner is the player whose unplaced buildings would occupy the least amount of space in the city. Fans of chess should enjoy exercising their strategizing muscles on this one. The hardwood board measures 9.25 inches square. <i>--Wendy Slotboom</i>" COL title VAL "Blue Orange Gobblet Board Game - A Fun Game of Strategy" COL feature VAL "Titc Tac Toe like Visual Perception problem solving An all wooden strategy game for 2 players, ages 7 to adult.

In modern times, running has become a popular sport, recreation and fitness activity. The run to Athens in 490 BC by an ancient Greek military courier named Pheidippides from a battlefield near the town of Marathon to report the Greek victory over the Persians is the famous endurance run upon which the first modern Olympics, held in Athens in 1896, based its longest distance run. It is legend that Pheidippides shouted, "Victory!," as he entered Athens and then immediately died from exhaustion. Spiridon Louis, a postal worker, also from Greece, won the first modern marathon, finishing a full 7 minutes ahead of the other eight finishers (seven others of whom were also Greek). In addition to its importance as one of the most challenging and dramatic athletic events in each Olympic Games, the marathon run has become a popular event in many locations throughout the world every year, often resembling a "fitness festival," celebrating human determination, stamina and dominance over the environment in which it is run. Finishing a marathon, in whatever time, is "victory" enough for most of the persons who enter the race. The Boston Marathon was first run on April 19, 1897. It is held every year on Patriots Day, commemorating the April 19th midnight ride of Paul Revere to warn his fellow American colonists in and around Boston that the British were invading from the sea at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The Boston Marathon is the oldest continuous marathon event outside of the Olympics. The New York City Marathon, begun in 1976 and held in November, has become the largest marathon, with over thirty thousand entries. The Los Angeles Marathon, held in March, is the third largest, with more than twenty thousand participants.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>" 0.984078314556967

Can you claim the Iron Throne? Designed for ages 14 and up, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second Edition is a classic game of warfare, diplomacy, and intrigue for three to six players. Taking control of the well-known characters from George R.R. Martin's beloved fantasy series, players must fight for dominance of the realm. Will you take power through force, coerce your way onto the throne with persuasive speeches, or rally the townsfolk to your side? With opportunities for strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, this game gives you a host of ways to spread your influence over Westeros. Based on the bestselling fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin (now a hit HBO series), A Game of Thrones: The Board Game draws players into a war-torn world of sun-scorched sands, lush forests, and chilling northlands. Each player takes control of one of six Great Houses of Westeros, then sets out on an epic campaign of combat and politics to secure total dominance. This board game includes clear, detailed rules to guide you through setup and gameplay. Play begins when each person receives an army of footmen, knights, siege engines and ship units as well as a set of order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique house cards, which represent important characters from <span style="font-style:italic;">A Song of Ice and Fire</span> and are used as leaders in battles against rival houses. A Game of Thrones: The Board Game captures the most memorable elements of George R.R. Martin's popular series. The detailed board represents an accurate map of Westeros, and the tokens and cards convey many of its most significant locations and characters. Attractive marbled plastic figures shaped as footmen, knights, ships, and siege engines display your military might to the realm while contributing to the game's overall medieval aesthetic. Game play proceeds over the course of ten rounds, after which the player who has claimed the most areas containing castles or strongholds is declared the winner. If at any time throughout the game a player controls seven such areas, that player may immediately claim victory. Fragile alliances will form and break over the course of each game, as players promise support to neighboring Houses only to betray them for their own selfish ends. But beware; as the war unfolds, the barbaric Wildings (which are controlled automatically by the game) work to amass their forces in the far north. Players must occasionally set aside their differences to face a common foe--or face the consequences together. A Game of Thrones: The Board Game draws you into a vibrant gaming world, bringing your favorite characters to life. The board resembles paint on distressed parchment for an old-world look, while the token and card art exhibits intricate detailing fans of the novels will recognize and enjoy. Game board, rule book, 138 plastic units, 105 cards, 6 player screens, and 266 tokens and overlays." 0.9766914732228995

COL title VAL "Global GSF-15-3 inch, 8cm Peeling Knife" COL feature VAL "Precisely balanced 3-inch knife for cleaning, peeling vegetables and fruits Blade made of high-tech molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel Edge retains razor sharpness exceptionally well Stainless-steel handle molded for comfort, dimpled for safe grip Lifetime warranty against defects and breakage" COL description VAL "GSF-15 Dimensions: Overall Height - Top to Bottom: -9.1". Overall Width - Side to Side: -2.2". Overall Depth - Front to Back: -0.7". Overall Product Weight: -0.2 lbs. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global's original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives, Global also makes a European-style "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty cutlery--like this 3-inch paring knife for cleaning and peeling vegetables and fruits. Global also dispensed with bolsters on most of its knives, including this one. Most Global knives have hollow handles, but the handle on this knife is solid. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a sharpening guide rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>" COL title VAL "Global GS-7-4 inch, 10cm Paring Spear Knife" COL feature VAL "Razor sharp Stays sharper longer Perfectly balanced Stainless steel seamless construction Sure-grip handles" COL description VAL "Cut strawberries for a delicious tart with this straight edge paring knife from Global.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop.

A deceptively simple device for an otherwise difficult task, Gilmour's 20-gallon insecticide sprayer looks a lot like a regular water bottle with a slightly complicated head. The process is simple: add the prescribed amount of chemicals and dilute with water, mixing well. Attach the included straw to the sprayer head, the sprayer head to a garden hose with the control valve turned to "off," and the deflector to the can's nozzle for a fan spray. Then turn the hose on, push the valve open, and spray away. The drawbacks? The plastic head is not nearly as sturdy as your usual hose sprayer head and is liable to break eventually, and the dilution is left to you instead of automated with a dial.

His  hat sits snugly on his head, so he won't have to chase it when a gust of wind   comes along. One of the neatest features is his light-up staff: his left hand  has several metal connectors that cause the staff to be raised and light up when  a lever on his back is pressed. The connectors are a bit finicky and not  necessarily seated well, but careful handling should solve any major technical  difficulties. The ball joints in the shoulders allow for a wide range of arm  movement; the paint detail is clean; and the easily removable cape is flexible  and does not detract from the clean lines of the figure.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

Routers don't get any bigger and tougher than this Hitachi workhorse. It has the solid construction, horsepower, and features we've come to expect in a top-of-the-line router. Its heft goes a long way toward eliminating vibration, working with the soft-start motor to cut out torque at startup. Despite its nearly 12 pounds, it actually handles as well as most 3-1/4-horsepower routers we've tried in freehand applications. It has a 1/2-inch collet and a wide sub-base opening, making it suitable for working with all but the very biggest panel bits. It features electronic variable speed, so the router makes clean cuts in a wide range of different materials. We found the controls to be within easy reach of the handles, and though this isn't the quietest router we've used, it comes pretty close. We like the unique eight-position handles that let the tool be adjusted to the worker rather than the other way around. While this is a topnotch plunge router, it's also an excellent choice for table mounting, and many people choose this model for exactly that reason. This is an all-around solid tool that offers more bang per buck than many competing models. <I>--Brian Trinen</I>" COL title VAL "Hitachi M12VC 2-1/4 Peak HP Variable Speed Fixed Base Router" COL feature VAL "11 Amp motor (2-1/4 Peak Horsepower), for precise, controlled cuts 2-stage motor release clamp, for quick and accurate depth adjustments and base changes Nickel plated motor housing, for smooth depth adjustments Electronic speed control, maintains constant RPMs even as load varies Class leading noise level, only 79.5dB for a quieter workshop" COL description VAL "Hitachi M12VC 2-1/4-Horsepower Fixed-Base Variable-Speed Router The Hitachi M12VC Variable-Speed Fixed-Base Router features a powerful motor and electronic speed control for making smooth cuts in a variety of materials.

The release clamp makes it easy to change from a fixed base to a plunge base (not included). Depth adjustments are also made easy by the nickel-plated motor housing, which also helps to reduce scratches and stains on the tool body. The M12VC has a collet capacity of 1/2 inch (not included) and 1/4 inch (included). <b>Ergonomically Designed for Comfort and Control</b><br>Like all Hitachi tools, the M12VC is ergonomically designed to enhance comfort and control on the job. To start, this tool weighs only 7.3 pounds, making comfortable enough for freehand routing. Additionally, the handles are wrapped in Elastomer compound to reduce vibration and prevent slippage for ultimate control. For further ease of use, the fixed base offers a smooth work surface for gliding over the workpiece without scratching.

Consisting of 108 letter cards in standard suits (Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs), WordThief asks players to construct valid English words from their seven-card hands.  Players collect scoring chips for each word they create.  Words formed entirely from one suit are protected from theft, (wordlocked), but those comprised from two or more suits are vulnerable to the next Word Thief.  It's a challenging, stimulating word game the whole family can enjoy!  Comes with 108 letter cards in four different suits, 100 scoring chips in four colors, scorepad and game instructions.  For 2 - 4 Players, Ages 9 and Up. Stealing the words right out of an opponent's mouth--or, in this  case, hand--has never been so accepted as in this vocabulary-building  board game. Designed for two to four players, Wordthief involves a  deck of letter cards, each of which is assigned a point value based on  its frequency of occurrence in English words. The obvious way to  create words is to use the seven cards dealt to you. The more  interesting way to accumulate points requires that you "steal" an  opponent's word and build a new word with more letters from your hand.  The player who makes the most words of the greatest point value wins the  round. An engaging alternative to <a  href="/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000IWDB/${0}">Scrabble</a>, this game  requires no playing board.

These precision scissors are commonly used in the west for pruning, but are perfectly suited for fine fabrics, general use and bonsai trimming. These are heirloom quality scissors that will last for years. In a recent enhancement, a length of quality tubing has been added to the handles as padding to prevent any soreness to your hands with continuous use. These cushions are not glued on and can be cut off if preferred. About this 350 year old company: Zhang Xiaoquan opened its doors during the Qing dynasty during Emperor Kangxi?s reign in 1663 AD. The brand was designated for imperial use in the Qing Dynasty court and got a special award from Emperor Qianlong. The crafting of these scissors require processes that evolved over three centuries: high-quality steel is set into wrought iron which is then forged and hammered into cutting edges. Next the edges are finely ground with mineral rich mud bricks from the area. You'll find the action to be smooth and sure. The company has received awards for excellence at the Southern Coast Industrial Exposition in 1910, the 1915 Panama Pacific Imitational Exposition and the 1926 Expo in Philadelphia. The age-old forging techniques of Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors have been included in the list of China's intangible cultural heritage. The package includes a sheet with this history and more information.

It offers a soft start for smoother operation and variable speeds from 8,000 to 22,000 RPM. The DW625's 3 horsepower, 15 amp motor uses state-of-the-art circuitry for soft starts and smooth operation, and its full wave electronic variable speed motor runs at 8,000-22,000 RPM with constant speed under load to ensure a quality finish in all materials. The rack and pinion depth adjuster, magnified scale, and micro-fine bit depth adjuster provide fast and accurate depth settings, while the phosphorous bronze bushings provide a smooth and accurate plunge. The handles offer total comfort and confidence as you guide the 11-1/4-pound DW625 around. And its soft start means no jerking, even when you start it at its peak speed. It comes with 1/2- and 1/4-inch collets, and when it's time to change the bit, you'll appreciate the spindle-lock button; it's a big square with a finger depression, unlike most other routers that offer either two wrenches to wrestle with or a small, sharp spindle-lock pin that leaves a red dent in your finger. One side of the base is rounded and one is flat, and it comes with a dust-extraction adapter. This DEWALT tool is backed by three-year limited warranty covering any defects due to faulty materials or workmanship (from the date of purchase). It's also covered by DEWALT's one-year free service contract, where DEWALT will maintain the tool and replace worn parts caused by normal use--for free.

Magnetic guides and orbiting diamonds sharpen the knife-edge at two precisely controlled angles, removing metal only in the areas needed. Leaves a longer lasting, sharper edge. Use for household carbon, stainless or alloy steel knives.<br><br>Amazon.com This electric sharpener is so simple to use that knives practically sharpen themselves. It puts a professional-style edge on any kitchen or sporting knife (except serrated knives). Because magnetic guides hold a blade at the proper angles, no guesswork is involved. You simply grip your knife loosely and pull it lightly through the sharpener's slots without pressing down. Key to this knife sharpener's performance is the two different stages: the sharpening stage and the second honing stage, which polishes the blade to a razor edge. Those two stages create different bevels, putting a "shoulder" on an edge instead of sharpening with a single bevel. The shoulder strengthens the edge so it lasts longer. For each stage there is a pair of slots, and the slots use 100 percent diamond abrasives for hardness.

When your favorite knives start squishing ripe tomatoes instead of slicing them, it's time to sharpen your blades. This knife sharpener is remarkably easy to use on both straight-edge and serrated knives. Simply plug it in, turn it on, and feed knife blades through the stages. The first sharpening stage uses 100 percent diamond abrasive disks to hone the knife's edge while the second stage incorporates polymer disks to polish and strop the edge to hairsplitting sharpness. Straight-edge knives should go through both stages, while serrated blades should only be used in the polishing stage. The internal elastomeric spring guides hold knife blades at just the right angle to the sharpening surfaces, making sharpening easy. The instructions are easy to follow, and maintenance is limited to removing the metal dust shavings from the clean-out tray once a year or so; no lubrication is necessary for the motor, bearings, or sharpening surfaces. Guaranteed not to detemper, the sharpener has a two-year warranty for home use. <i>--Ariel Meadow Stallings</i>" 0.9825072345151423

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

In addition, the LCD thermostats also display the current room temperature. Invented by Holmes in 1985, window fans are ideal for use in the bedroom because of their quiet operation; they're also much less expensive to run than air conditioners. However, similar to an air conditioner, this twin window fan features Accutemp digital temperature control. Exclusive to Holmes fans, the Accutemp digital thermostat measures the air temperature of the room and automatically runs the fan to maintain the temperature youve programmed, switching itself on and off as needed. You can also use the Accutemp LCD screen to read the current room temperature anytime you want. In addition to three speed settings, the window fan also allows you to choose from three modes--air intake, air exhaust, or air exchange--giving you precise control over the climate of the room. Air intake brings cool air in from outside, while air exhaust blows stale, warm air out of the room. Air exchange does both simultaneously: one fan brings in outside air as the other fan exhausts air from the room. The fan can be mounted either horizontally or vertically, and fits double hung, slider, or casement windows from 24 to 36 inches. Slider Safe extender panels are included for a safe, custom fit.

This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keepers Friend. To use the Bar Keepers Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keepers Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keepers Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you won&#x92;t have "hot spots" when cooking.  <li>Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface. <li>Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles. <li>Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods. <li>Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pan&#x92;s edges to seal in flavor of your foods. <li>The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops.  <li>The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface. </ul> <b>Warranty</b> <br> From date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 8-inch fine-edged blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a sharp point. Part of the popular Four Star series, the hand-honed blade is slim and narrow to facilitate even, precise meat cutting and flexible enough to allow thin slicing. It is made with Henckels' Sintermetal Component Technology (SCT), which allows three different grades of steel to be combined to form a single piece, fusing together the blade, bolster, and tang. What does this mean in layman's terms? It means a strong, high-quality knife that will last a lifetime. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell </i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines. Four Star knives were designed and developed in close cooperation with renowned professional chefs. The result was a fully forged knife with a unique molded handle. The Four Star line contains knives for all tasks, and includes the following open stock knife types: parer, bread, peeling, sandwich, utility, carving, chefs, granton edge slicer, santoku, and others. Four Star knives are also available in a range of block sets and gift sets. <td> </tr> </table> <P> <B>A Higher Standard in Knife Construction</B><P> Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of exclusive-formula, high-carbon, no-stain steel under the all-new Sigmaforge standard. As a result, Four Star knives have improved quality consistency, lasting sharpness, and perfect geometry. Sigmaforge one-piece construction also provides high precision and improved stability of the blade and steel structure, thus improving cutting-edge retention for lasting sharpness. In addition, Four Star knives use J.A. Henckels Friodur ice hardening for corrosion resistance, a process that also contributes to cutting-edge retention. <P> <center> <img src=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-twinselect-forging.jpg align="center"></center> <p clear=left> <B>It's All in The Grip:</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar-handle.jpg </td> <td> The Four Star series features high impact polypropylene handles that are permanently bonded to the knife blades without any gaps.

The Chroma Type 301 boning knife features a sharp, thin 5-3/4-inch blade that efficiently bones meat and poultry. A "fin" extending below the meeting of the blade and handle gives the hand extra control for working the blade in and around bones.

After use, Chroma knives should be immediately washed and dried by hand, and placed in a storage block for safekeeping. To sharpen, use only a Chroma original 301 ceramic whetstone, never a sharpening steel which can damage the fine blades. Chroma Type 301 knives make exceptional gifts and are covered by a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>" 0.9845160126963749

This means it provides you with smoother cuts, and it can handle fast feed rates. It's ideal for crosscutting hard- or softwoods that are 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thick, and it also provides good results when cutting plywood and chipboard or when ripping wood. The blade can also handle laminate, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.090 kerf. Plus, because this thin-kerf blade removes less material than standard carbide blades, it wastes less material and requires less horsepower to produce smooth, clean results. <b>Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design</b><br>This Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. <b>High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance</b><br>This crosscutting saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide "crosscut blend." Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo. With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money. <b>Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat Buildup</b><br>Built to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp. As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or "pitch" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster. This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty. <b>About Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing</b><br>An industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

It will be the most flavorful and moist chicken you've ever had! Made of quality stainless steel, this roaster begins with a vertical roasting stand that attaches to a large, round drip tray (the stand collapses for easy storage). In the center of the drip tray sits a round dish with cone shaped top. Fill the round dish with herbs, spices, cider, juices or beer; as your chicken rests on the stand, the aromas and flavors from the liquids and herbs pass through the perforations on the cone shaped top, filling the cavity of the bird and adding moisture to the meat as it roasts. Instructions on using the vertical roaster are included. If your last experiment with a vertical roaster led to the bird tipping on its tripod base and landing in the grease pouring out of its cavity, here's a chance to get it right. This Norpro model is versatile enough to serve as a horizontal 13-by-8-1/2-inch rack for roasts. And it easily but sturdily converts to vertical roasting by anchoring up to four hooked pieces to the slats of the flat rack, enabling two birds to roast on this roost, cooking evenly inside and out, with no danger of capon cartwheel. Flipping the bird, so to speak, is a thing of the past--there's no need to pull the rack out of the oven halfway through cooking--and you may as well roast two while you have the heat cranked up (put one in the freezer for next week).

The deep drip tray collects the fat so that it doesn't coat your oven, although putting a baking sheet under the roaster is advisable for larger birds. The vertical roaster promotes even cooking, since all sides are exposed to the oven's heat. This configuration also makes the skin exceptionally crispy, a feature which will be lost on those who discard the skin for health reasons The drip tray and rack are both made of stainless steel, which conducts heat quickly and evenly. <i>--Julija Gelazis</i>" 0.9754369112279714
