The steel is hardened using the patented Friodur ice hardening system for maximum no-stain properties and excellent blade strength because of the improved resistance to corrosion and pitting.

To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;IN.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended." COL description VAL "GG1 Electric -- DCC Ready PRR - SILVER W/RED STRIPE "CONGRESSIONAL" - #4866 - HO Scale.

The game pieces have been modeled after the main characters from the film: Manny and Ellie (both mammoths), Diego the saber-toothed tiger, and Sid the sloth. The figures are detailed, colorful, and convincing -- certain to charm fans of the movie.<P> Players begin by arranging 24 tiles in a six by four grid at the center of the board. Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play. If they're struggling with the written instructions, they can watch the easy-to-follow video tutorial on the DVD. <P> <b>Interactive DVD Keeps Game Exciting </b><br> The entire game is played alongside the interactive DVD. With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers. For this reason, it's recommended for ages 6 and up.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, game board, 24 double-sided board tiles, 5 game movers, instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL title VAL "Family Feud DVD Game" COL feature VAL "Play Family Feud with Richard Karn as Host Get ready to do battle with real Family Feud questions from the show Team Playoff Rounds Fast Money Rounds With Over 800 Family Feud Questions" COL description VAL "Survey says...this Family Feud DVD Game is sure to be a hit with your family and friends.

Basically, the color enhancement concept works by selectively positioning transmission in the blue, green, and red spectral regions whereby one can improve the color discrimination between different color objects. These are the same colors used to produce a color television picture. They optimize the readability of such displays under high ambient light conditions. Phillips 202 Glass utilizes rare earth oxides in its composition to provide the same filtration. This glass is very efficient in filtering sodium flare in addition to providing ultraviolet protection to 390 mm. The Phillips 202 glass is becoming a preferable choice of lamp workers. It is very comfortable for viewing under high ambient light conditions such as when working with glowing heat sources for a duration of time.

This knife is made from a single piece of high quality CROMOVA 18 stainless steel with a square tip and an ultra sharp blade. The ice tempered, convex edge can hold a sharper edge for a longer time so you can slice vegetables and make a delicious bowl of pasta primavera. It has an ergonomic handle with a dimple pattern making it comfortable and slip resistant, useful for repetitive slicing. The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. This knife can be used in place of a Santoku knife so you can also cut meats and fruits. 5-1/2" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 5-1/2-inch knife for precisely slicing and chopping vegetables is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

The game begins with players choosing one of four collectible tokens to represent their team. Sculpted out of metal, these tokens have been modeled after the most famous ships in the series: the Enterprise, the Enterprise D, the Defiant, and the Voyager. The game board is collapsible and features two sizes, giving you the option of playing a 15-minute quick game or a 40-minute extended game.<P> Teams advance around the board by answering two types of questions: traditional trivia cards and DVD-based puzzles. The trivia cards, which resemble what you might find in Trivial Pursuit, come in three different categories: green "compendium" questions, red "events" questions, and yellow "culture" questions. They vary in difficulty, and some of the tougher questions are challenging enough to stump even the most seasoned Trekkies.<P> The main attraction, however, is the interactive DVD. Filled with video clips, sound bites and images from the franchise, the DVD challenges players to answer brain-teasing Trek puzzles. With a dozen different puzzle categories, the DVD puts your knowledge of Star Trek to the test. Categories include "Spatial Anomaly," where players must identify a character based on a distorted image, and "Coded Transmission," which challenges players to decrypt a secret message.<P> <b>Something for Everyone -- From Cadets to Fleet Captains</b><br> The DVD has been designed with the fans in mind. You'll see cameos by your favorite characters, watch video clips from classic episodes, and be treated to narration by the Enterprise computer. You'll even do battle with a Romulan Warbird in the tiebreaker mode. All in all, it's a consummate Star Trek experience.<P> With hundreds of questions, Star Trek Scene It? has something for every type of Star Trek fan. It features questions from all six television shows and every motion picture (excluding the most recent 2009 film). The difficulty is also varied enough to keep everyone engaged -- from Star Trek savants to casual fans. Some of the DVD challenges are so riveting that even non-fans will enjoy themselves.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, Flextime game board, Six-sided number die, eight-sided category die, 4 collectible metal tokens, 16 prime directive cards, 175 trivia cards, 4 category reference cards, and instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL title VAL "Star Trek Trivia Game" COL feature VAL "1000 Trivia Questions For 2-4 players Your knowledge influences your success Fan Collectible Officially Licensed Collectible" COL description VAL "Attention Trekkies, the ultimate Star Trek trivia game is now available.

COL title VAL "Jafco 3 Strap Muzzle - White" COL feature VAL "3-Strap Muzzle Please refer to sizing chart photo & instructions below Designed to be worn for extended periods Prevents wound licking, eating rocks, garbage, poison, etc Helps with dominant and aggressive dog training" COL description VAL "The Jafco Muzzle has been around for years. It is a plastic basket muzzle that offers a great deal of security, and they go on a lot easier than most muzzles. They come in different sizes, please refer to sizing chart and instructions below. If you are looking for a good utility muzzle that will last for years and years, this is your best choice. All are made with polyethylene plastic with three reinforced rubber straps. The clear plastic muzzle is softer and more flexible than the white or black style plastic muzzles. These muzzles are not designed for muzzle fighting training. DESIGN & USES Can be worn for extended periods without inhibiting the dogs breathing, barking, and panting. Dogs can drink with the muzzle on, using a water bowl or bucket. It is best to "teach" your dog that it is okay to put the muzzle into the water before leaving the dog unattended for any period of time. Prevents wound licking, and eating rocks, garbage, poison, etc. Prevents injuries from dog fights. Allows dogs to use some modes of transportation when properly muzzled, which some transportation companies require. FITTING THE DOG The vinyl nose piece should be just below the dogs stop with the end of the muzzle touching the dogs nose. When on the dog: pull the muzzle out and down; pull the muzzle out and up. If at some point the muzzle comes off, its either too loose or too big. The muzzle should fit comfortably and allow the dog to pant and bark. SIZING TIPS & CHART There are a few things you need to know about sizing a muzzle for your dog: The muzzle cannot be longer than your dogs actual "nose length". If the muzzle is longer than your dog's nose length, the muzzle will be in the dog's line of vision. The muzzle's circumference must be larger than your dog's "nose circumference." We recommend between one and three inches larger than your dog's measurement. If the muzzle is the exact same size as your dog's nose, the dog won't be able to pant."

Simply press a button to raise the incline ramp to your preferred position. The ramp angle is fully adjustable from a level plane up to 40 degrees, so you can individually target and work all major lower body muscles.

The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Use the <b>Chop</b> function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the <b>Grind</b> function for grinding spices, and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover, and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Read to clean up? No problem! To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover, and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover, and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly, and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts."

Magnetic guides and orbiting diamonds sharpen the knife-edge at two precisely controlled angles, removing metal only in the areas needed. Leaves a longer lasting, sharper edge. Use for household carbon, stainless or alloy steel knives.<br><br>Amazon.com This electric sharpener is so simple to use that knives practically sharpen themselves. It puts a professional-style edge on any kitchen or sporting knife (except serrated knives). Because magnetic guides hold a blade at the proper angles, no guesswork is involved. You simply grip your knife loosely and pull it lightly through the sharpener's slots without pressing down. Key to this knife sharpener's performance is the two different stages: the sharpening stage and the second honing stage, which polishes the blade to a razor edge. Those two stages create different bevels, putting a "shoulder" on an edge instead of sharpening with a single bevel. The shoulder strengthens the edge so it lasts longer. For each stage there is a pair of slots, and the slots use 100 percent diamond abrasives for hardness. The sharpener measures 7 inches long, 4-1/4 inches high, and 3-3/4 inches deep and carries a two-year warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Chef&rsquo;sChoice 320 Diamond Hone FlexHone Strop Professional Compact Electric Knife Sharpener with Diamond Abrasives and Precision Angle Control, 2-Stage, White" COL feature VAL "Unique patented stropping and polishing stage Two-stage sharpening for durable, longer-lasting edges 100% diamond honing; guaranteed to never detemper Precision elastomeric spring guides hold blade at the proper angle Totally safe for quality knives <span class="a-size-base a-color-secondary">                 EdgeCraft Corporation was established in 1985 with a very specific mission; to create one of the worlds best knife sharpener.

Although it is the only supersonic airliner ever created and flown, the British Airways Concorde succumbed to a lack of export orders that could have guaranteed its continued production. Furthermore, economic and environmental pressures obliterated any chance of commercial success for the supersonic airliner. The Arospatiale-BAC Concorde supersonic transport (SST) was the more successful of the only two supersonic passenger airliners to have ever operated commercially (the Tupolev Tu-144 being the other). First flown in 1969, its service commenced in 1976 and continued for 27 years. It flew regular transatlantic flights from London Heathrow (British Airways) and Paris Charles de Gaulle (Air France) to New York JFK and Washington Dulles, flying these routes at record speeds, in under half the time of other airliners. It also set many other records, including the official FAI Westbound Around The World and Eastbound Around the World world air speed records. British Airways (BA) is the largest airline of the United Kingdom and one of the largest in Europe. It was one of only two operators of the Concorde supersonic airliner (the other being the state-owned Air France), with a daily service between Heathrow and New York JFK. BA used the aircraft to win business customers, guaranteeing a certain number of Concorde upgrades in return for corporate accounts with the airline, a key factor in winning business from transatlantic competitors. Concorde made large operating profits for British Airways for much of its service life. British Airways, simultaneously with Air France, inaugurated the world's first supersonic passenger service with Concorde in January 1976. While commercial jets take seven hours to fly from New York to Paris, the average supersonic flight time on the transatlantic routes was just under 3.5 hours. In transatlantic flight, Concorde travelled more than twice as fast as other aircraft, making them appear to be flying backwards. Up to 2003, Air France and British Airways continued to operate the New York services daily."	0

If your dog does not return he receives a static correction which is startling but not harmful.

Players choose their cards, move their pawns, and let their imaginations soar as they make their way to the castle to win! For 2 to 4 players. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. "Once upon a time, King Kandy, the Imperial Head Bonbon and Grand Jujube of Candy Land disappeared." Thus begins the magical journey of Milton Bradley's classic Candy Land board game. Captivated by the story of a kidnapped king and eager to help find him, little ones move their gingerbread pawns along a rainbow path and through a land of candy characters, all subjects of King Kandy's realm. <P> Playing cards thoughtfully designed for non-readers are coded with colorful squares matching the jeweled stepping-stone path or an occasional token matching one of the characters' symbols: draw a blue card, move to the nearest blue stepping-stone; draw a snowflake and earn a visit to Queen Frostine's iceberg. There are occasional pitfalls, too: land on the wrong square and you might be stuck in Molasses Swamp until a red card is drawn. With all these enticing, sugarcoated images (and King Kandy plainly visible at path's end), children can't help but be delighted by Candy Land. It's delicious! Instructions are in both Spanish and English. Candy Land is for two to four players) <i>--Julie Ubben</i>"	1

Included in this kit are the components you need to run from the burner itself to the included gas shutoff valve and your installer will connect your gas source to the inlet of the valve. This fire pit burner kit is intended for propane (lp) gas and includes a 24" round stainless steel fire ring, which consists of two concentric rings. Each piece is neatly machine welded so parts fit together seamlessly. The central hub measures 1/2" and is raised above the rings to keep water from entering the valve or Gas line. The fire ring is made of heavy .065 wall material for maximum durability and strength. Made from stainless steel, this fire ring will not rust and can be used in all outdoor environments. Burner ports are staggered to create full and vibrant flames. Each burner port is drilled, not punched, to allow the fuel to properly flow through the ring. This creates a very natural-looking flame pattern and prevents debris from building up, avoiding the annoying whistling sound that is often heard in lesser quality fire rings. This fire ring should be installed by a licensed professional. NOTE: Propane kits require the use of a fire pit pan (not included) for safe and proper use."

COL title VAL "Bachmann Trains Steam Whistle in Freight Station" COL feature VAL "Pre-assembled Molded in color No assembly required Designed for N Scale Layouts Highly detailed Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track&#039;. Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;In&#039;. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case,  Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do Not Use Steel Wool To Clean Your Track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition.   Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended. Bachmann hopes you enjoy your train for many years to come!"

The game comes with three levels of play, so kids can learn and grow with the game. With more than 55 million units sold, Mastermind is a great strategy game . . . and one of the worlds most popular games ever. Its easy to learn and fast to play, and its different every time. The Codemaker sets a secret code, then the Codebreaker tries to match the code using logic, deduction, and maybe even a little bit of luck. After each move, the Codemaker gives clues to the Codebreaker. With lots of possible code combinations, every game is guaranteed to be a brainteaser. All of this mind game's components can be stored in the game board. For 2 players ages 6 and up; the winner will be a true master mind. Includes game console with built-in storage tray and code peg shield, 72 jungle animal pegs in 6 colors, 30 scoring pegs in two colors, and complete instructions. Younger kids can develop their powers of logic and deduction in this game of code-cracking fun. This version is simplified for younger children and comes with colorful animal pegs, a jungle-and-mountain-theme board, and fewer code options. The point is the same: one player duplicates the other's code in as few turns as possible. The code maker sets a code of 3 colored animals (choosing from 72 in six colors), and conceals it beneath a "rocky mountain" tray at his or her side of the board. In each of nine rows (of large holes), the code breaker attempts to replicate the pattern. After each row (or turn), the code maker places red or white creature pieces in the adjacent row of small holes, which gives the code breaker clues on how he or she doing. Complete instructions include rules for younger players (based on colors only), older players (color and position), and expert players (a blank-space option adds complexity). This challenging and fun game is for two players. <i>--Ava Natov</i>"	COL title VAL "Scientific Toys RC Tarantula" COL feature VAL "Radio Control Spider with real spider like creeping and crawling Looks so real- it might scare your friends!

COL title VAL "ZWILLING J.A. Henckels 12&quot; Diamond Sharpening Steel" COL feature VAL "UPC Code 230173 dimension 18.75x4.5x1.75 inches" COL description VAL "UPC Code: 230173, dimension:18.75x4.5x1.75 inches Although steels often are touted as sharpening tools, few actually sharpen knife blades but do perform the vital task of realigning, or "resetting," edges, which bend when contacting a cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool's surface contains diamond dust, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. While using this steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings. This steel will also perform better than a steel without diamond dust because it accomplishes the final task of a professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine point while realigning the edge. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it, and this steel's 12-inch rod handles all household knives. The steel carries a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Zwilling J.A.

The stainless-steel sharpener comprises two modules, which are marked on the sharpener. The first module features steel wheels for coarse sharpening and presharpening, and the second module uses ceramic wheels for fine sharpening and smoothing. This sharpener works well for both right- and left-handed people, features rubber feet so it won't skid on the countertop, and measures approximately 8 inches across and 3 inches tall, so you can store it in a drawer or display it in a small space. To use, place the knife sharpener on a flat surface, pressing down slightly with one hand. Draw the knife blade with a little pressure towards yourself, repeating up to five times for the dullest blades. For very blunt knives, use the first module and then the second. Knives with a bit of bluntness may require only the first module to bring back the original sharpness. Check the results by cutting into a sheet of paper."	1

This is the deluxe Wusthof 10" inch steel it has a slightly larger shaft and more substantial handle.it can realign your knife edge quickly and easily. Honing steels are often confused as sharpeners. Your honing steel will realaign your knife edge but will not put a new edge on it. In trying to explain what a honing steel does try to imaging your sharpening steel and your toothbrush. It is a maintaince tool that you use everyday. In the case of your knife this would be maintaining the knifes edge. Now eventually you would need to see your dentist. That would be a sharpener. This would be a more detailed and agressive action and they would actually remove metal from the edge of the knife. Much like a dentist would do to your teeth. Now to maintain healthy teeth you brush everyday. To maintain a sharp knife you should steel your knife everyday. And remember only go to the Dentist(sharpener) once or twice a year. This tool serves a vital role in the kitchen by realigning, or resetting, a knifes' edges, which bend this way and that when contacting a cutting surface. (Often called a sharpening steel, or butcher steel, a steel doesn't actually sharpen a knife--unless it's a diamond steel.) Consisting of a rod of hard steel-alloy and a tough synthetic handle, this steel works as well as any. A loop facilitates hanging it close at hand so the steel can be employed often: before each use is ideal to prevent a blade from becoming dull and prolong intervals between professional sharpenings. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it; this steel's 10-inch rod is sufficient for nearly all household knives. The steel carries a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Wusthof Classic 10-in. Honing Steel 10-in."

The redwood or cedar striker eliminates harsh overtones and is rot resistant.

After all, the initial impulse to play a game is social; that is, we bring out a game because we want to do something together. How ironic then that in most games, we spend all our efforts trying to bankrupt someone, destroy their armies - in other words, to get rid of one another! At <b>Family Pastimes</b> we believe that people of different ages and abilities should be able to play side by side, each making their best contribution.

We hope you enjoy playing and learning together! Children learn the benefits of cooperation in this innovative game from Family Pastimes. Each player tends a small garden composed of four different types of vegetables. The object is for all players to harvest all the vegetables before winter arrives. If one of the four colors comes up when the color-coded die is thrown, then each player may harvest one vegetable of that color from his or her own garden or from any of the other gardens. If the die comes up black, each player may choose which color vegetable to pick. If the die shows a white dot, then a Winter piece must be placed on the board. The game ends when all players harvest all vegetables, or when all six Winter pieces are filled in. Cooperation is encouraged with a few special rules: if a player's garden has been completely harvested and he or she rolls the white dot, then a winter piece is <i>removed</i>. Players are thus subtly encouraged to concentrate on one garden at a time, instead of each tending only to their own gardens. <I>--Michael Fehlauer</I>"	COL title VAL "Family Pastimes Princess - A Co-operative Game" COL feature VAL "Players work together helping to rescue the sturdy little princess from the guarded castle We'll do some sharing, help each other to remember where special things are hidden, and together think our way past the obstacles Awarded the Canadian Toy Testing Top Rating For 2 to 4 players ages 4 through 7 years Hand-made in Canada using recycled boards and papers, soy-based inks, water based glues and safe paints" COL description VAL "An exciting fantasy game offering a thoughtful and imaginative play experience!

As players move their pieces around the board, they uncover tools such as a boat, key, or magic potion. These are used to get past six obstacles that guard the princess: a moat, a guard dog, a sentry, a locked door, a dark tunnel, and a magic spell. It's a race against time, because in addition to objects, the board contains spaces that advance the coming of the night and the end of the game. Cooperation comes into play when players help each other come up with creative uses for the various objects. The horse, for example, might be used to swim the moat or run past the dog, or might be traded to the guard as a bribe. Since all players are working toward a common goal, everyone wins or loses as a team."	1

In addition to obesity and health concerns, many experts say that lack of exercise is a leading cause of hyperactive and destructive behavior in dogs. As the owner of two beloved Pit Bull dogs, I'm always looking for ways to keep them well exercised. My busy schedule doesn't allow for the long walks recommended by professional dog behaviorists. I read about something called a flirt pole and thought it would be worth trying out. It works by converting the natural prey drive instinct in dogs into exercise as they attempt to catch the lure by sprinting, changing direction and jumping. So I bought one of the fiberglass rod flirt poles that are made in China. The good news is the dogs went crazy chasing the lure. The bad news is it lasted one day. One chomp on the tip of the rod and the fiberglass broke and splintered in my dog's mouth. I was angry and decided to design my own. My new and improved Flirt Pole V2 is made in the USA using components tested for durability, strength, safety and light weight. The only toy on the market that uses bungee cord to prevent; whiplash ; when lure is caught Easily change lures without the use of fasteners that can injure your dog's mouth Lightweight.

This cast aluminum crepe pan makes it very much within the scope of the average home cook. Not only is making them easy, this pan's inverted design makes the process super speedy too. In fact, you need only cook the crepe on one side so there's no tricky flipping involved. You'll soon find crepes to be your answer to any meal, especially one that needs to be on the table fast. Sweet or savory, rolled, folded or stacked, crepes are incredibly versatile. This upside-down pan cooks crepes and blintzes quicker and easier than a traditional skillet. Its convex cooking surface looks like the pan's bottom, but it's actually the top. Dipping the pan into crepe batter coats it uniformly. Inverting the pan over a gas or electric burner quickly cooks a paper-thin crepe, and the pan's nonstick surface releases the crepe easily. (Recipes and instructions are included.) Made of heavy cast aluminum, the pan heats evenly and holds heat exceptionally well so there's no down time between crepes waiting for the pan to reheat. The pan's handle is made of hardwood to stay cool crepe after crepe. The pan carries a 20-year warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "VillaWare V5225 Crepe Maker" COL feature VAL "900-watt electric appliance makes crepes, blintzes Convex, nonstick surface cooks quicker, easier than skillet Automatic thermostat with ready-light controls temperature Stay-cool plastic handle; 7-1/2-inch-diameter cooking surface Simple to use, with dipping plate, recipes, instructions included" COL description VAL "This VillaWare crepe maker bakes versatile, paper thin, 7" crepes.

Easy-to-read instructions with big diagrams make learning a snap. Weavers begin by looping heavy cotton string between the loom's slanted nylon pegs, forming the "warp" of their design. Then, using the long, plastic needle and brightly colored yarn provided, they weave the "weft"--the filling that goes over and under the string--creating designs and holding the piece together. In addition to a sense of accomplishment, children get the chance to practice math and fine-motor skills. They can use this 7.5-by-10-inch loom to create wall hangings, doll blankets, coasters, bookmarks, and more. Winner of the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio's Gold Seal Award. <i>--Joan DeClaire</i>"	1

These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag: <strong><font color=CC6600>Buy for Cold</font></strong><br> It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10. Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for "warm" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night. <strong><font color=CC6600>Goose or No Goose?</font></strong><br> The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly <i>and</i> stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use. All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget. <strong><font color=CC6600>Bags for All Shapes</font></strong><br> Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips. <strong><font color=CC6600>Pad Yourself</font></strong><br> No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes.

Tick ID card pictures include: American Dog tick (d. Variabilis), Deer tick (ixodes Scapularis), Lone Star tick (a. Americanum). The ProTick Remedy was superior when tested at Ohio State University against other tick removers and tweezers. Here's a quote from a research paper published in 1995. " . . . while others (tick removers and tweezers) broke the tip of the hypostrome and chelicerae (mouthparts) in at least one (American Dog tick) tick. The ProTick Remedy succeeded in removing all fifty-one ticks without damaging any mouthparts . . . results indicate that the ProTick Remedy removed the most tick cement while causing the least damage . . ." More recent tests against nymph deer ticks (the dangerous immature ones) showed that the ProTick Remedy removes nymph deer ticks on par with the #4 tweezer, by successfully removing 100% of the tested nymph deer ticks. Of critical importance is not only the intuitive ease of use that a tool design offers but also it must be a tool you can carry easily. The critical time period is to remove a feeding tick within 24 hours. This is not a guarantee but is the primary recommendation. When you need that tick removed, you need it now because most of us don't really know exactly when the ticked attacked us. Was it an hour ago, 10 hours ago . . . who knows? The ProTick Remedy is in your pocket, or your wallet, at your side ready to pull the tick off and stop its feeding. The ProTick Remedy meets and exceeds any expectation for ease of use and ease of carry. And because it's made of steel you can rely on its precision indefinitely. Includes a Lifetime Guarantee"	1

Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

Overall Depth - Front to Back: -10.5 Inches. Overall Product Weight: -2 Pounds. The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder? In addition to the Host Guide, eight player's books, and the tape, the package contains a map of the crime scene, secret clues, guest invitations, and nametags. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>"	1

Quantity: 100 Also available in quantities of 25, 50 and 200. -----How to make a Scrabble tile pendant using square epoxy stickers-----Carefully peel the clear square epoxy sticker off of its protective backing, being careful not to touch the sticky side. Place the sticker directly on top of the image you are using. Press firmly with your fingers to remove any air-bubbles and to help secure the adhesive bond. Cut out the image with the sticker on top - carefully cutting along the edge of the sticker, making sure not to cut the sticker itself. Spread glue (a white glue such as Nunn permanent glue or Crafter's Pick works fine) on the backside of the cut out image/sticker. Center the image/sticker glue side down onto the non-letter side of the Scrabble tile (check the orientation of the letter on the back to make sure it's facing the right direction). Press into place and let dry. You can easily add a glue on bail such as an Aanraku bail to the back of the pendant once the front side is dry. It is recommended to use E6000 industrial strength adhesive to adhere the bail."	0

Favored by people who want to burn the most calories in the shortest time. The smooth, natural leg stride, push/pull arm action is optimum for sculpting legs, strengthening arms and improving overall body tone. By working both legs and arms, your heart rate elevates more quickly which encourages your body to burn calories faster and more efficiently. This also results in a lower perceived rate of exertion even though you are burning more calories; you get a lower impact workout resulting in less overall stress on your knees, hips and back.

Plus, elliptical trainers offer a diverse, efficient workout, with a smooth, natural leg stride and a consistent push/pull arm action combining to sculpt your legs, strengthen your arms, and improve your overall body tone. Elliptical machines are also popular for cardiovascular training, as they provide a low-impact alternative to walking and running. The 1260EF offers plenty of workout flexibility, with a cutting-edge console that supports 13 preset programs, including manual, random, interval, hill climb, sprint, target HR, HR interval, fat burner, HR hill, cardio, glute burner, quad builder, and total trainer.

Puffer was born November 3, 1997. This Beanie Baby looks like  her real-life counterpart. She has a black back, head, and wings, and her chest,  undertail, and face are all white. Black felt accents make her gold  eyes stand out. Her beak is yellow with bright orange accents and her  feet are bright orange too. Collectors and noncollectors alike love  Puffer.

COL title VAL "Global G 45 Ceramic Sharpener" COL feature VAL "Maintain the razor-sharp edges of your knives between sharpenings with this easy-to-use ceramic honing rod Lightweight design features ergonomic handle with Globals signature dimple pattern, which provides a stronger grip Oversized hand guard helps ensure your safety 10" length accommodates a wide variety of cutlery, large or small Not for use with serrated or hollow-edged knives" COL description VAL "Also called a Honing Steel. The Global G 45 Ceramic Sharpener is used to hone the blade of kitchen knives. It will maintain a sharp edge with daily use. Despite the name, sharpening steels don't actually sharpen  knives--unless they're diamond steels. Instead, they perform the vital  task of realigning, or resetting, edges, which bend when contacting a  cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool is made of  harder-than-steel ceramic it performs better and quicker than most  steels. Using the sharpener often--before each time a knife is employed  is ideal--prevents a blade from becoming dull and prolongs intervals  between professional sharpenings, or the need of a whetstone or other  true sharpening device. Like Global's signature knife handles, the  ceramic sharpener's handle is molded for comfort and dimpled for a safe  grip. The rule is that a realigning tool should be at least as long as  the knife blade being drawn across it, and this sharpener's 9-1/2-inch  rod is long enough for most household knives. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Cybrtrayd Life of the Party J074 Music Piano Mint Musical Instrument Chocolate Candy Mold in Sealed Protective Poly Bag Imprinted with Copyrighted Cybrtrayd Molding Instructions" COL feature VAL "Because clear plastic molds scratch easily and collect dust, Cybrtrayd's molds are packaged in sealed, protective, clean poly bags. 12 cavities; Dimensions per cavity: 1-1/2" DIAMETER 3/8" DEEP; Cavity capacity in oz: 0.3 Our protective poly bag is imprinted with easy-to-follow, concise, copyrighted Cybrtrayd instructions for regular, 3-D and hollow Chocolate Molding, as well as instructions for melt & pour soap molding.

COL title VAL "Bachmann Trains Nickel Silver E-Z Track Reversing System-Ho Scale" COL feature VAL "Set Includes, 4 - straight auto reversing tracks, 4 - radius curve auto reversing tracks, 2 - straight tracks, 2 Hayes bumpers, power pack and variable speed controller. Trolley Car Not Included Nickel Silver rail with Gray roadbed E-Z track system--snaps together, stays together on floors, tables and carpets No nails, screws or special tools needed Modeled from AAR track engineering dimensions Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track&#039;. Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;In.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case,   Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. DO NOT USE STEEL WOOL TO CLEAN YOUR TRACK. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition.   Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended."

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 8-inch fine-edged blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a sharp point. Part of the popular Four Star series, the hand-honed blade is slim and narrow to facilitate even, precise meat cutting and flexible enough to allow thin slicing. It is made with Henckels' Sintermetal Component Technology (SCT), which allows three different grades of steel to be combined to form a single piece, fusing together the blade, bolster, and tang. What does this mean in layman's terms? It means a strong, high-quality knife that will last a lifetime. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell </i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines. Four Star knives were designed and developed in close cooperation with renowned professional chefs. The result was a fully forged knife with a unique molded handle. The Four Star line contains knives for all tasks, and includes the following open stock knife types: parer, bread, peeling, sandwich, utility, carving, chefs, granton edge slicer, santoku, and others. Four Star knives are also available in a range of block sets and gift sets. <td> </tr> </table> <P> <B>A Higher Standard in Knife Construction</B><P> Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of exclusive-formula, high-carbon, no-stain steel under the all-new Sigmaforge standard.

Outdoor furniture covers need to breathe so that moisture can escape, keeping mold and mildew from developing under the cover. Koverroos use technologically advanced materials that are one-way breathable - so moisture can evaporate right through the fabric, but water, dust and dirt can-feett get in. Koverroos covers are stronger than most vinyl covers, yet light weight. This means our covers are easy to use - no struggling to get them on and off. Also, these patio furniture covers are able to handle temperatures from -100 degrees Fahrenheit up to +240 degrees. The KoverRoos III Large Bar Set Cover is appropriate for most weather conditions as it maintains all of the great features of Dupont Tyvek; however, KoverRoos III offers better durability, good for slightly harsher or windier climates. Lightweight and easy to put on and remove, these covers have a soft inner layer that is gentle on your furniture-feets finish. KoverRoos III patio furniture covers score 4 out of 5 in breathability, 5 out of 5 in dirt and dust protection, 5 out of 5 in mold and mildew protection, 4 out of 5 in rain protection, 3 out of 5 in durability, 4 out of 5 in ease of storage, and 4 out of 5 in color retention.

If you have a gas stove with flames please use a protective metal piece to protect your Tagine from cracking. HOW TO CURE A TAGINE? It is necessary that it is seasoned before initial use. Please follow these simple instructions below for maximum results: 1. WATER: The new tagine needs to be first submerged in water for at least 1 hour. If you cant submerge it, place it in a clean sink bowl and slowly fill the base of the tagine with water until it stops absorbing it. Place the tagine lid on top and fill it as well. Let stand for 30 minutes to allow full absorption of water into the clay. Empty excess water and set to dry for 5 minutes. 2. OLIVE OIL: All you need is 3 table spoons of olive oil, 2 for the base and one for the lid. Spread the olive oil throughout the base and lid with your hand. 3: HEAT: While the tagine is still wet with the oil applied to it, place it in the oven as shown in the first or second photos, and set temperature at 350 F and leave for 45 minutes. The evaporation of moisture creates a vacuum effect to pull the olive oil into the clay which glazes and seals it. Then leave the tagine cool down in the turned off oven.

The infamous German industrial designers, Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs were the masterminds behind the project; and, with their "Less, is more" design philosophy they produced a number of memorable products for Braun including some of the best travel alarm clocks around. Over the last 40 years, Braun time pieces were characterized by their pure, highly functional and timeless design with no superfluous details: Every feature directly reflects a function. Rooted in over half a century of modern design at Braun, the core values of functionality, quality and aesthetics are reflected in all clocks and watches. The strength of clarity and simplicity of their design makes them a pleasure to use and to own. The analogue clocks were manufactured with the intention to prioritize innovation and durability. The beautifully sleek structure and dial illumination, together with the slight graying back of the numbers ensures that the hour arms are clear and easily readable. All the clocks use precision German movements, known for their silent nature and high accuracy. A variety of models use radio controlled movements for complete accuracy of time. A selection of the very best classic clocks and watches have been recreated in keeping with the high standards of quality of the originals. At the same time, brand new designs on both watches and clocks take the collection further than ever before"	0

Always make sure to screw in each light bulb squarely to ensure that no water can make its way into the socket and also to have no shorts of the fuse inside the male plug. <span>         <a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/sign-in.html?ie=UTF8&ref=&email=&redirectASIN=B00KY725AM&disableCorpSignUp=&path=%2Fgp%2Fcoupon%2Fc%2A2ZYQBD78IB5Z9FA2KWAJZXU70VKG&redirectProtocol=&mode=&useRedirectOnSuccess=1>Clip this coupon</a> to save 5% on this product when you buy from Amazon.com.                            <span class="a-declarative" data-action="a-modal" data-a-modal="{&quot;width&quot;:&quot;450&quot;,&quot;header&quot;:&quot;Promotion Details&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/gp/promotions/details/popup/A2ZYQBD78IB5Z9&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;600&quot;}">             <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="a-popover-trigger a-declarative">               Here's how             <i class="a-icon a-icon-popover"></i></a>         </span>         (restrictions apply)              </span>" COL description VAL " <strong>G30 Outdoor Globe String Light Set With 25 Globe Bulbs - Black Wire - 25 Feet</strong> G30 Globe String Lights With 25 Globe Bulbs By Novelty Lights - Indoor/Outdoor Commercial Use - Vintage Backyard Patio Lights - Outdoor String Lights - Globe Wedding Light String - Black Wire - 25 Foot.&nbsp; Our G30 globe string light set with 25 bulbs is perfect for outdoor patios, decks, special event or Christmas lighting.&nbsp; Our G30 bulb is a C7/E12 candelabra base and comes with a C7/E12 candelabra string.&nbsp; Each set includes 25 globe shaped bulbs on a SPT-1 wire stringer with 25 sockets that are spaced 12" apart on Black Wire.&nbsp; It is always a good idea to have extra bulbs on hand so please consider purchasing a replacement box of bulbs to be used as extras or replacements (ASIN B004PKIA4O).&nbsp; These G30 light strings have long lasting 3,000 hour bulbs and are on a 20 gauge Black wire.&nbsp; All our G30 light strings use patented Admiral Brand sockets.

Nomads wrapped in rags, Tusken Raiders can disappear into the desert landscape, only to burst from nowhere brandishing a gaderffii stick or rifle, both of which they use with lethal skill.

The combined riveted handle design is combined with a contoured shape to add comfort and control. The handles are made of a durable synthetic material that is extremely comfortable to use. The Classic Ikon adds a rear bolster that acts as a counter balance when using the knife. This second bolster adds significant blade control. Classic Ikon has a unique forward bolster as well. The forward partial bolster is designed so you can sharpen the complete length of the blade. This bolster is also curved inwards to allow your fingers greater control while holding the knife by the blade. Wusthof uses a special blend of German steel through out the whole length of the knife. The ingredients of this steel are proudly etched on each blade. Wusthof not only uses the best materials to make a fine knife, but it is also crucial that each blade is precisely tempered. This tempering allows the knife to hold its edge for an extremely long time, yet still be able to be maintained in your home kitchen with out the need to be sent away for maintenance. Our unique compound angle is not seen in many knives. This angle tapers from the spine of the knife to the edge to allow for a sturdy, yet extremely sharp edge while it also tapers from the bolster to the tip to give the knife strength as well as flexibility. Located in "The Cutlery Capital of the World", Solingen Germany, the Wusthof factory history goes back as far as 1814 when the company was listed with the Duchy of Berg.

With a few pins, some muslin, you can explore more pattern tweaks and learn more about fitting on a dress form quickly than you could in hours of flat-pattern investigation on paper.

Equipped with Metal Wheels International-style hook and loop couplers Large "G" Scale Size Recommended for ages 8 years old & up Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;IN.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended." COL description VAL "Thomas & Friends - CLARABEL COACH - Large "G" Scale Rolling Stock.

As the name suggests, this poppy is native to the Himalayan region of Asia, and these poppies prefer a shady, cool place to grow. This variety is blue, and the color can be changed slightly by adjusting the pH of the soil it is growing in. Even though they prefer cold climates, the plants need well-drained soils especially in the winter. The seed needs to have a cold treatment before planting. Using a damp paper towel, place the seed on the towel and place it in a plastic container with a sealable lid. Keep the seed container in the refrigerator for 4 weeks. Start the seed indoors. They need light to germinate but keep out of direct sunlight. Press the seed into the soil but do not cover. Keep the seed moist until germination. At a temperature of 60  65F, germination usually occurs within 28 days. Space the plants 18 inches apart. Grow in partial shade and in most, acidic soil. Blue Poppy is usually resistant to deer."	0

Exquisite original art are available on nature, sports, history etc." COL description VAL "Go The Distance Scramble Squares Humans have always participated in endurance running, originally to hunt for food and to avoid becoming food. In modern times, running has become a popular sport, recreation and fitness activity. The run to Athens in 490 BC by an ancient Greek military courier named Pheidippides from a battlefield near the town of Marathon to report the Greek victory over the Persians is the famous endurance run upon which the first modern Olympics, held in Athens in 1896, based its longest distance run. It is legend that Pheidippides shouted, "Victory!," as he entered Athens and then immediately died from exhaustion. Spiridon Louis, a postal worker, also from Greece, won the first modern marathon, finishing a full 7 minutes ahead of the other eight finishers (seven others of whom were also Greek). In addition to its importance as one of the most challenging and dramatic athletic events in each Olympic Games, the marathon run has become a popular event in many locations throughout the world every year, often resembling a "fitness festival," celebrating human determination, stamina and dominance over the environment in which it is run. Finishing a marathon, in whatever time, is "victory" enough for most of the persons who enter the race. The Boston Marathon was first run on April 19, 1897. It is held every year on Patriots Day, commemorating the April 19th midnight ride of Paul Revere to warn his fellow American colonists in and around Boston that the British were invading from the sea at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The Boston Marathon is the oldest continuous marathon event outside of the Olympics. The New York City Marathon, begun in 1976 and held in November, has become the largest marathon, with over thirty thousand entries. The Los Angeles Marathon, held in March, is the third largest, with more than twenty thousand participants. In addition to marathons, races of other lesser (and even greater) distances take place throu Runners and wheelchair racers pit themselves against the clock in this marathon version of the Scramble Square challenge. Easy to Play, but Hard to Solve is the motto for this deceptively simple-looking puzzle. By the time you've become addicted and find yourself unable to solve the thing, you'll realize it's not so much a motto as a warning. Nine colorfully illustrated cardboard 4-by-4-inch squares depict various unfinished, themed images along their edges. The images must be matched and the nine squares arranged in a larger square. An ingenious, elegantly executed puzzle idea, Scramble Squares will have you simultaneously blessing and cursing its inventor. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>"	0

Sancho and I are Pointers who love to track varmints. There is a squirrel "Sebastian" who teases us daily but we can never catch him. This squirrel was made in his likeness so that we can play with him indoors. Many dog toys are very bright colored, made to look like cartoon versions of animals. They can look a bit like 'eye sores' around a room. That's a minor problem. A more serious one is: what respectable hunting dog wants to be caught dead carrying around a cartoon? Our squirrel is made to look as close as possible to the real thing. Sebastian is made of a tougher-than-average plush material that has out-lasted any of our other stuffed toys. However, he is only built to stand gentle chewing. If your dog has a history of destroying toys, this may not be the toy for him. At least supervise and remove when your dog starts chewing. No plush toy can stand up to an aggressive chewing dog, but if your expectations are realistic, we think you will be happy with Sebastian. So, if your dog loves to chase squirrels, this is the perfect interactive toy for him. It will stimulate his hunting instincts and provide him with hours of entertainment and companionship. Sancho loves Sebastian so much he sleeps with him by his side.

Nao's extensive collection of more than 300 sculptures captures the unforgettable moments of life including motherhood, weddings, childhood, falling in love, the joy of pets, the beauty of nature, religion and much more. Both gift-givers and discriminating collectors alike will appreciate the quality and attention to detail that signifies each and every Nao sculpture. Nao, part of the Lladro group, is sold in more than 122 countries around the world. The demure attitude of the young girl in the Nao So Shy figurine creates a quiet sweetness on a child's dresser or at the front of a china hutch. Though her eyes are downcast, the girl's face and hands are expressive of a charming personality. Her dress flows prettily, and its trim is elaborately sculpted. Moderately weighty yet light in form, the piece is handmade from porcelain in the famous Lladro studios of Spain. Handpainting gives it a delicate palette and a glossy overglaze catches the light for a subtle gleam. A lovely gift or addition to an ongoing collection, the figurine bears the Nao stamp on its underside and stands approximately 7-3/4 inches high. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>"	0

The tool's square handle provides a good grip and allows easy revolution of the steel to spread the work around its surface. Fitted with a loop for hanging storage, the steel also stashes tidily in most knife blocks. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>"	COL title VAL "Hooker Furniture Brookhaven Wood Top End Table in Clear Cherry" COL feature VAL "The Brookhaven Collection is crafted from hardwood solids with cherry veneers.

COL title VAL "Norpro Large No Post Stainless Steel Vegetable Steamer" COL feature VAL "Expands from 7 inches/18cm to 10 inches/25.5cm Made of heavy-duty stainless steel with a three-pronged base No center post means extra room for more food, easier scooping Two side-handle loops for lifting Hand washing recommended" COL description VAL "The three pronged base provides stability equal to those with center posts, so instead of one central handle there are two ring style side handles. The side handles supports the basket's shape, rather than allowing it to open flat upon lifting. Capacity for more to steam. Segments fold inward for compact storage It's less what it includes than what it lacks that makes this Norpro vegetable steamer a cut above your average steamer insert. Without a bothersome center post, there is plenty of unobstructed room to steam entire heads of broccoli or cauliflower or full-length cobs of corn--and finished vegetables are easier to remove with a spoon or a spatula as denser veggies keep steaming. No need to slice carrots or pole beans beforehand--just plop them whole into the basket, which expands from 7 to 10&nbsp;inches, depending on the size of the pot you set it&nbsp;in. The three-pronged base provides stability equal to models with center posts, but instead of one central handle there are two ring-style side handles. This is another improvement, as you don't need to reach into the middle of the steaming-hot food to remove the basket, and using the side handles supports the basket's shape rather than allowing its "petals" to pop open flat upon lifting. The heavy-duty waffled segments hold tightly together during use and fold inward for compact storage. <i>--Carol Gnojewski</i>"	COL title VAL " Norpro Stainless Steel Vegetable Steamer" COL feature VAL "Steaming is one of the best ways to cook vegetables!

Overall Depth - Front to Back: -10.5 Inches. Overall Product Weight: -2 Pounds. The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder? In addition to the Host Guide, eight player's books, and the tape, the package contains a map of the crime scene, secret clues, guest invitations, and nametags. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>"	COL title VAL "Decipher How to Host a Murder: The Watersdown Affair" COL feature VAL "CD with period music and details of the murder, a host guide with instructions, optional menu and costume suggestions Eight guest invitations and envelopes, layer name tags, individual player manuals Sheet of secret clues with summary of findings, diagram of the crime scene" COL description VAL " You and your guests are the suspects!

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>"	1

The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 10-inch fine-edged blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a sharp point. The hand-honed blade is slim and narrow to facilitate even, precise meat cutting. It is made with Henckels' Sintermetal Component Technology (SCT), which allows three different grades of steel to be combined to form a single piece, fusing together the blade, bolster, and tang.

Made from CROMOVA 18 stainless steel, this light knife was created for optimum performance. It was made from a single piece of steel, and has a convex edge for easier slicing. The strength comes from the ice hardening process that reaches a Rockwell degree of C-56-58. It has a wide blade with a thick edge to give you ultimate control. Using this knife feels good on the hands thanks to the hollowed handle and compact design, making it ergonomic for repetitive use. The iconic Global dimple design is on the traditional handle for a nonslip grip. 7" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who like hefty knives, its original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. This knife, however, is relatively heavy. Thick at the back, the broad, 7-inch blade, designed for butchering fish and chopping hard vegetables, carries enough weight to chop through fish bones. For clean, low-friction cutting, the blade is tapered to an edge on only one side so it's even sharper than other Global knives. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Shun Pro 8-1/4-Inch Deba Knife" COL feature VAL "Ideal for filleting fish, beef, poultry or chopping vegetables, Deba knives are typically lighter and deliver precision cuts Made from VG-10 high-carbon steel; designed to take and hold its sharp edge longer; wide blade bevel sharpens with whetstone Premium D-shaped Pakka Wood handles rest comfortably in the curve of a palm, giving precision control, and a secure grip Single-bevel blade delivers superior sweep and razor-sharp slicing ability; available in 8-, 7-, and 4-inch sizes Hand washing and air drying recommended for best care; comes backed by a limited lifetime warranty" COL description VAL "<ul><li>Dimensions: 2.0 IN x 13.75 IN x 0.87 IN</ul>"	1

The high porosity of de*nitrate supports the proliferation of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that further remove these toxic aquarium byproducts. Even when exhausted as an organic adsorbent, de*nitrate continues to be an excellent support for the biological filter and does not have to be removed. This product is sold by volume. Cited weight is minimal weight.DIRECTIONS: For best results, de*nitrate should be placed to assure the flow of water through it, such as in a canister filter, chemical filtration module, or box filter.  Flow rate should not exceed 200 L (50 gallons*) per hour. If higher flow rates are unavoidable, use Matrix or Pond Matrix. It is best to rinse off dust before use. Once de*nitrate  has been in use for several days, nitrate concentrations should start to fall and level off gradually at a concentration of about 45 mg/L as nitrate. As long as nitrate concentrations remain under control, the product is not exhausted. Each 1 L of de*nitrate  treats about 200400 L (50100 gallons*), depending on initial nitrate concentration and the current biological load.

Our customers say: "Ryan (5) feels very important getting all his vegetables in and then helping me." - Saskatchewan, Canada <b>Play as friends, not as enemies!</b> Family Pastimes games foster the spirit of cooperation. Players help each other climb a mountain, make a community, complete a space exploration... They never play against each other. After all, the initial impulse to play a game is social; that is, we bring out a game because we want to do something together. How ironic then that in most games, we spend all our efforts trying to bankrupt someone, destroy their armies - in other words, to get rid of one another! At <b>Family Pastimes</b> we believe that people of different ages and abilities should be able to play side by side, each making their best contribution. We are all there together when we finish the game to take joy in our successes and wonder how we might work together even better the next time we play. Thus, Family Pastimes games will prove to be a friendly form of fun. Socialization, entertainment, academic learning, character growth, etc. - whatever your objectives, we invite you to realize them by cooperative means. We hope you enjoy playing and learning together! Children learn the benefits of cooperation in this innovative game from Family Pastimes. Each player tends a small garden composed of four different types of vegetables. The object is for all players to harvest all the vegetables before winter arrives. If one of the four colors comes up when the color-coded die is thrown, then each player may harvest one vegetable of that color from his or her own garden or from any of the other gardens. If the die comes up black, each player may choose which color vegetable to pick. If the die shows a white dot, then a Winter piece must be placed on the board. The game ends when all players harvest all vegetables, or when all six Winter pieces are filled in. Cooperation is encouraged with a few special rules: if a player's garden has been completely harvested and he or she rolls the white dot, then a winter piece is <i>removed</i>. Players are thus subtly encouraged to concentrate on one garden at a time, instead of each tending only to their own gardens. <I>--Michael Fehlauer</I>"	COL title VAL "Family Pastimes Caves and Claws - An Award Winning Co-operative Adventure Game" COL feature VAL "Players work as a team to find the ancient artifacts while surving in the jungle There is much work to be done - paths to build, artifacts to find and all the while dangers are lurking!

Henckels International Paring Knives are perfectly designed for smaller kitchen tasks such as peeling or coring vegetables and fruits. 3-pc set includes: 3.5-inch paring knife, 3-inch vegetable knife and a 2-inch peeling knife. Lifetime limited manufacturer warranty. Dishwasher safe. Packed in a beautiful wood storage box, the eight knives in this set slice steaks, chops, or roasts and, because they're stainless steel, they match stainless-steel flatware at the dinner table. The knives have 4-inch blades cleverly angled to prevent wrist strain while applying maximum pressure. The edges are serrated so they do tend to tear meat fibers rather than slicing cleanly through them as straight-edge steak knives do. Stamped from high-carbon stainless steel, the knives have 18/10 stainless-steel handles and are dishwasher-safe. The storage box is heirloom quality, with a glowing, deep-auburn mahogany finish. Knives rest in wood slots at an angle that makes them easy to retrieve. The box measures 15 inches long, 5 inches wide, and 1-3/4 inches deep and has brass clasps.

Made in Spain, lifetime warranty. From one of Henckels' moderately priced cutlery lines, these eight steak knives divide any rib eye, chop, or roast into bite-size pieces and then store in a handsome wood box. The thin, curved blades are perfect for precise cutting, although their fine serrations tend to tear meat fibers rather than slice neatly through them. Stamped from high-carbon stainless steel, the knives are lighter in weight than forged knives and don't have bolsters, which might not be essential when confronting a thick prime rib. The synthetic handles feature classic three-rivet styling with full tangs for strength. The storage box is stained a rich auburn. It has brass hinges and snap closures and measures 15-1/4 inches long, 1-3/4 inches high, and 5-5/8 inches wide.

With the Sauron expansion, the fellowship of Hobbits are no longer competing solely against the game and its boards. In Sauron one player takes on the role of the dark lord and seeks to thwart the fellowship's crucial mission. Okay look, we've all seen the movies, many of us have read the books, and plenty of us have already played the incredibly cool <I>Lord of the Rings</I> board game designed by Reiner Knizia. And while the determined pluck of the hobbits is obviously worthy of admiration, haven't you ever thought there was something kind of cool about Sauron? Sure you might not want to admit it, or maybe you do, but the guy is in at least a partially sympathetic spot. He just wants to rule all of creation and to do that, all he needs to do is pry some jewelry away from a hobbit. With this Sauron expansion set to the original board game, players can get their chance to play the bad guy himself, employ the Black Rider, and rule them all. But beware: with this set, the pesky hobbits have some new weapons of their own. The set includes 30 Sauron cards, nine Nazgul cards, and five Fellowship cards. It's not capable of being played on its own but makes a great counterpart, and counterpoint, to the original board game. <I>--Charlie Williams</I>"	COL title VAL "Lord of the Rings Board Game" COL feature VAL "Original Version Made in Germany!" COL description VAL "Lord of the Rings is a co-operative game where the object is to destroy the Ring while surviving the corrupting influence of Sauron. Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power. The game is played on a number of boards: the Master board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits, and a number of scenario boards which detail the events and adventures of particular locations. Progression across the boards is determined by playing cards (many of which represent the characters and items of Middle Earth), and the effects of corruption are represented by a special die. The game is lost if the ring-bearer is overcome by Sauron, or won if the ring is destroyed by throwing it into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom."	1

To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended."

Construction: -Seamless construction for easy cleaning. Dimensions: -Dimensions: 8 1/4'' D. Warranty: -Lifetime limited warranty against defects and breakage. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 8-1/4-inch knife for carving meat and poultry is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Global G-313 Knives Carving Set (G-3,G-13) 2 Pc, Silver" COL feature VAL "Stainless steel tines hold meat in place for steady carving and slicing Stainless-0steel handles is seamlessly constructed and textured for a good grip Fork lightweight, yet perfectly balanced" COL description VAL "Perfect for carving roast poultry or slicing slow-cooked brisket, this sleek, modern carving set makes a versatile addition to any cook's collection.

Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keepers Friend.

This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keepers Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keepers Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

COL title VAL "All-Clad 5110NS Stainless Steel Nonstick Fry Pan Cookware, 10-Inch, Silver" COL feature VAL "Classic slope-sided, 10-inch frying pan Two stainless-steel layers sandwich pure aluminum core for even heating Layer of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick bonded to interior Long, comfortable, stay-cool handle riveted for strength Lifetime warranty against defects" COL description VAL "Fry with style and grace, and stop worrying about which cooktop you're using with this flexible and high quality frying pan by All-Clad. Near perfect in design, the pan is constructed of three layers of metal; two stainless steel outer layers with an aluminum core. The stainless steel exterior combined with the aluminum core allows the pan to be used on all types of stovetops, including induction, and heats the pan evenly to eliminate hot spots. Additionally, the pan has a non-stick coating which makes food removal and clean-up a breeze. The classically sloped sides help prevent messes, and when you're finished cooking, the pan can be hung through the handle's eyelet for convenient storage. Producing some of the finest cookware in the nation, All-Clad has been featured in many high class and gourmet restaurants for its superior performance and aesthetically designed pieces crafted from American artists using the finest metals. A firm believer in quality over convenience, All-Clad's metals are formulated and bonded with cooking performance in mind, and are combined with stunning designs to provide you with the best cooking experience possible. The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the steel. This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 10 inches in diameter, perfect for cooking tuna or tofu, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for a healthful meal. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg.

This knife can be used in place of a Santoku knife so you can also cut meats and fruits. 5-1/2" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 5-1/2-inch knife for precisely slicing and chopping vegetables is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

COL title VAL "Bachmann Industries 52' with 35' Piggyback Trailer New York Central Flat Car, 6&quot;, HO Scale" COL feature VAL "Silver Series rolling stock Blackened metal wheels, Body mounted couplers Non-magnetic axles, Moveable ramps, & Realistic trailer For HO Scale Train Sets Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;IN.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug The Power Supply Immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended."

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM "tent cities" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, Eurekas new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition. For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Womens Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian. <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents.

He just wants to rule all of creation and to do that, all he needs to do is pry some jewelry away from a hobbit. With this Sauron expansion set to the original board game, players can get their chance to play the bad guy himself, employ the Black Rider, and rule them all. But beware: with this set, the pesky hobbits have some new weapons of their own. The set includes 30 Sauron cards, nine Nazgul cards, and five Fellowship cards. It's not capable of being played on its own but makes a great counterpart, and counterpoint, to the original board game. <I>--Charlie Williams</I>"	COL title VAL "The Lord of the Rings Collector's Chess Set" COL feature VAL "The 32 playing pieces are precise miniature sculptures in fine pewter of the actual cast members and each likeness is so realistic-they were personally approved by the individual actor.

Use on chairs, counter tops, beds, in front of doorways, trash cans and the sofa. Requires one 9 volts alkaline battery (not included)." COL description VAL "The Sofa Scram is a product that was developed as much by our customers as by us. Back in the 1990s we began getting countless requests from consumers for a "SCAT MAT" type of device that didn't use shock. After all, being the leaders in sonic pet training, our customers expected that we should have such a device, and we agreed.  In creating the product, the behavioral science was pretty easy. Just blast the pet with enough irritating sound to make the floor a bit more appealing than the couch. The mechanical design was the challange. We needed a clever idea to create a soft, paw activated pad. Of course, our ingenious engineers (as they constantly remind us) were happy to oblige. They created a flexible, pressure sensitive material that acts as a continuous switch, controlling the same speaker we use on our Sound Barrier and Yard Barrier products. Our designers covered the device with mountaineering grade pack cloth to create a beautiful, rugged and absolutely annoying pet scram mat.  Instantly activated by the touch of a paw, the battery operated Sofa Scram emits startling 85 decibel beeps that get pets off the furniture fast! This item has been a best seller for the past fifteen years! Pet owners love the Sofa Scram  because it works quickly and effectively without applying shock or pain to your pet. Compare to "Scat Mat" type items selling for as much as $80.00. The Sofa Scram  works just as effectively, just as quickly, does not hurt your pet and it sells for about half the price!

High-tech welding of knives this size and larger combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang.

The game pieces have been modeled after the main characters from the film: Manny and Ellie (both mammoths), Diego the saber-toothed tiger, and Sid the sloth. The figures are detailed, colorful, and convincing -- certain to charm fans of the movie.<P> Players begin by arranging 24 tiles in a six by four grid at the center of the board. Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play. If they're struggling with the written instructions, they can watch the easy-to-follow video tutorial on the DVD. <P> <b>Interactive DVD Keeps Game Exciting </b><br> The entire game is played alongside the interactive DVD. With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers. For this reason, it's recommended for ages 6 and up.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, game board, 24 double-sided board tiles, 5 game movers, instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL title VAL "Imagination Entertainment Family Feud 2 Edition DVD Game" COL feature VAL "Hours of fun the whole family can play Double and triple money rounds Hundreds of questions Just like the actual game show" COL description VAL "It's the same family with an all-new feud.

Now you won't have to wait for your central heating system to do what this Broan fan/heater can do instantly. <div class="aplus" ><div class="two-third-col"> You don't need to heat the entire house to have a comfortable bathroom first thing in the morning. The NuTone QT9093WH combination fan/heater/light/nightlight combines a high-output 1500-watt heater with a 110 CFM ventilation fan and 100-watt lighting, warming your bathroom at the touch of a switch. Now you won't have to wait for your central heating system to do what this Broan fan/heater can do instantly. Offering quiet operation, the QT9093WH produces 3.0 sones of noise to ensure your bathroom remains peaceful. Crafted with galvanized steel and a die-cast zinc grille in white enamel, it's a suitable match for any decor no matter how many times you change the paint color. The bright incandescent lighting uses one 100-watt A19 lamp (not included), and its nightlight function (7-watt bulb, not included) has the perfect glow to light a dark bathroom during a nighttime visit. This easy-to-install combination fan and light projects just three inches from the ceiling, and it includes detachable junction box with three wiring knockouts and a four-function wall switch. Other features include expansion-type hanger bars and mounting brackets, plus a built-in quiet, nonmetallic backdraft damper. You hastily get ready every morning, head for work, the office, or school, just when the central heating system has finished warming the entire house. It's about as inefficient as it gets. Spot heating solves that problem. No longer will you heat an entire home when you simply need a bit of comfort in the bath or dressing room, or any other room. Even the most efficient central heating systems send heat up the chimney. But NuTone spot heaters deliver every bit of energy back into your home. There's no external venting, so the electricity you convert to heat is delivered directly where you want it. Permanently lubricated motors are quiet and require no maintenance. They can be operated by a built-in adjustable thermostat or an optional wall-mount controller. Heaters may be converted in the field to a choice of wattages/voltages. And for safety, heaters are thermal overload protected and the complete heater assembly conveniently removes from the housing for cleaning. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. NuTone ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. Today, Broan-NuTone leads the industry with forward-thinking residential ventilation products, customized climate, communications and storage solutions and superior customer service. The Broan brand focuses on range hoods, ventilation fans, heater/fan/light combination units, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) fresh air systems, built-in heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators and trash compactors, while the NuTone brand offers door chimes, central vacuum systems, stereo intercom systems, medicine cabinets, ironing centers, ceiling fans and ventilation fans."

To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;IN.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended. Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do Not Use Steel Wool To Clean Your Track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended." COL description VAL "GG1 Electric -- DCC Ready PENN CENTRAL - BLACK W/WHITE LETTERING - #4882 - HO Scale.

The filter circulates water through the gravel bed and oxygenates it for beneficial bacteria growth. The slots on the filter plate have been designed to draw water evenly over the entire plate from front to back and left to right. The high tube connectors are molded into the filter plates to offer a secure grip onto the one-inch diameter lift tubes to keep the tubes from being knocked out by fish and preventing gravel from falling under the filter plate. There are three tube holders and caps. The Perfect-A-Flo air stoneprovides a  flow of fine bubbles. A 3/16 inch ridged tube connects to the air diffuser inside the uplift tube and will attach to airline tubing at the top of the uplift tube. When using an airpump and airstones use two uplift tubes per plate.  The fish protector is molded right into each elbow to prevent fish from entering the uplift tubes.  The Perfect-A-Flo Carbon Cartridge (not included) will fit into the fish protector.  These cartridges contain top-quality activated carbon to remove harmful gases, odors, and unsightly discoloration.For powerhead attachment place the one-inch uplift tube on the outside tube holder. The powerhead should have a flow rate of 100-140gph. Use one uplift tube per plate when using a powerhead.

Since 1972, Amana Tool has been producing router bits and has become the global leader in its field. In fact, the company was the first manufacturer to produce router bits according to the Holz BG German standard for safety and quality. This standard contains rules that determine the structure and quality of the tool's material in order to create the safest environment for the user. From its beginning, Amana Tool has always used the highest quality materials, and its tools are produced using unique technologies, a majority of which were developed and built by the company's engineers following decades of testing and experience. For example, Amana Tool uses carbon alloy steel for its router bits that contains vanadium particles. This improves the structural integrity of the steel and prevents corrosion and defects in the internal structure of the material that can lead to cracks and breaks. High-tech machinery processes the carbon alloy steel to manufacture the router bodies in a single clamping. This yields router bits with superior balance, centricity, precision and symmetry. Create raised panels for cabinet doors, frame and panel furniture, and architectural paneling with a raised-panel bit. The cutter forms a fillet to delineate the raised field, a shaped band around the field, and an integral tongue to fit the panel groove in the frame members. The profile contour and the reveal width varies. All tools have 1/2-Inch shanks. Must be used in a table-mounted 3-Plus horsepower router and run at reduced speed. Use these bits for panels with curved edges. Multiple passes recommended."	0

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

The product comes in powdered form and it is simply added on a daily basis to dry or wet food. Dogs and cats like the taste of the small amount that is added. Proden plaqueoff animal does not rely on topical application or friction. The product is ingested and works systemically. The natural compound in the product comes out through the saliva and works to break down the bacterial biofilm that forms on the teeth and gums. This is how the natural bacteria in the mouth take hold onto the teeth and gums, colonizing and creating the oral problems of plaque and tartar, bad breathe and gingivitis. It does not change the ph of the mouth or kill off the normal levels of bacteria. Proden plaqueoff has been proven to reduce plaque and tartar on the teeth and gums, depending on composition, diet and how long it has been there. It then works to prevent bad breath, plaque and tartar from returning. Patients generally begin to see results over a 2-8 week period, and will see further benefits with continued use. Proden plaqueoff animal is made from a specific strain of selected seaweed harvested from above scandinavia. This seaweed has developed a natural defensive mechanism against bacterial biofilm. The product is made only from this seaweed and has no additives or chemicals added. It is human grade and human tested."	1

Users can keep track of their heart rate, distance traveled, calories burned and more on the LED display. While the self-generating elliptical provides a tough cardio workout, it is low impact to stay easy on the joints. EXTRA-WIDE pedals give users a stable platform for their workout, while a water bottle holder helps them stay healthy and hydrated as they train. Give your body a hardy workout in your own home without stressing out your joints with the commercial grade Fitnex E70 elliptical trainer. This self-generating elliptical machine features an step trainer for your legs that's combined with moving arms that help work out the arms, shoulders, and chest for a perfectly balanced cardio/strength workout. The E70 has six built-in workout programs, including manual, HR, race, and weight loss. The easy-to-read matrix/LCD display offers the following feedback options: time, weight, watts, program level, distance, RPM, speed, calories, average speed, and pulse rate (which is read through contact heart rate sensors built into the handlebar).

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

And for camping and outdoor events, it can run portable stereos, outdoor lights, and electric grills. (Note: All appliances should be checked for actual wattage ratings.) When choosing a portable generator, it's important to identify the starting watts of all the devices you might power at the same time. Some devices draw additional power as they get up and running. If this additional wattage is not accounted for, system overload can result.

COL title VAL "ZWILLING J.A. Henckels 12&quot; Diamond Sharpening Steel" COL feature VAL "UPC Code 230173 dimension 18.75x4.5x1.75 inches" COL description VAL "UPC Code: 230173, dimension:18.75x4.5x1.75 inches Although steels often are touted as sharpening tools, few actually sharpen knife blades but do perform the vital task of realigning, or "resetting," edges, which bend when contacting a cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool's surface contains diamond dust, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. While using this steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings. This steel will also perform better than a steel without diamond dust because it accomplishes the final task of a professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine point while realigning the edge. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it, and this steel's 12-inch rod handles all household knives. The steel carries a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "ZWILLING J.A. Henckels 32576-230 ZWILLING Accessories Sharpening Steel, 9&quot;, Black/Stainless" COL feature VAL "Ergonomic, easy-to-grip polypropylene handle with hanging hole 9-inch steel Helps maintain edge of your fine edge knives Lifetime guarantee Made in Germany" COL description VAL "Even the best knife will lose its initial sharpness during the course of time. Using a sharpening steel each time you use your knives will keep the edge aligned, resulting in a sharper, safer knife. A classic tool that helps get the best from knives, this sharpening steel is a solidly crafted addition to any knife block. Between professional sharpenings, tiny metal fibers bend down on a blade, dulling the surface. The purpose of the sharpening steel is to straighten up those fibers, maintaining the sharpest edge possible for daily use. This model is lightweight, with a flared handle and a tapered edge. It's extremely comfortable and well balanced for experienced users, but beginners may have an easier time with a more substantial weight. Just wipe it down as necessary--there's no need to give this tool a serious scrub. <I>--Jill Lightner</I>"	1

Return a few hours later--or after a good night's sleep--to the unforgettable aroma and taste of homemade bread. This machine will even make the jam to top it off.<P><P>The Breadman Ultimate makes and bakes most kinds of yeast bread--white, whole wheat, rye, honey banana, or crusty French--as well as quick or batter breads. Try the recipes in the booklet or your own favorites--just be sure the dry ingredients total less than about 5 cups so the dough doesn't overflow the 9-1/2-inch (nonstick) baking pan. If your recipe calls for adding ingredients late in the kneading cycle, there's a tray to hold and automatically dispense them. If you want to make bread that doesn't conform to the loaf shape, the machine can mix and raise the dough prior to shaping for baking in a conventional oven. <P><P>For the beginner the process couldn't be easier, and even if you're an old hand at making bread from scratch, you'll find yourself baking much more frequently. And this machine quickly pays for itself: think of how many $3 or $4 loaves you won't be buying over the bread maker's lifetime!

Create croissant or pizza dough for shaping by hand and baking in the oven. Make the classic fruitcake to serve during the holidays. From basic recipes to custom creations, the bread machine produces delicious results--and without the additives and preservatives found in store-bought brands.

By using only the freshest ingredients and making choices between a variety of options, homemade bread can be an important part of a well-balanced diet--for both young and older family members alike. High in fiber and low in fat, bread contains a wealth of beneficial components. It provides complex carbohydrates needed for energy, protein for strong muscles, and vitamins and minerals, including calcium and iron for healthy bones and teeth. Add nutrient-rich eggs to the recipe or choose whole-grain flour for an extra boost of fiber, iron, vitamins, and minerals. Mixing in nuts and dried fruits not only add to the pleasing consistency and taste of the finished product, but they're also another way to add to the overall health factor. <table align="left" cellpadding="10" width="225" border="0"><tr><td><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/aplus/B00005QFL0/panasonic-dispense._V192027591_.jpg" border="0" align="top"></a><br><small><i><b>Yeast dispenser automatically adds yeast at optimal time to ensure perfect results.</b></i></small></td></tr></table> <h3>Ultimate Convenience</h3> <br>Thoughtfully designed, the bread machine also supplies a YeastPro automatic yeast dispenser.

Even more, the unit's inner bake pan comes fitted with a wire handle (use an oven mitt when hot) for easily removing it from the appliance when the bread has finished baking. The pan's nonstick coating allows baked bread to slide easily out of the pan onto a cutting board or a wire rack to fully cool for easier slicing. <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="225" border="0"><tr><td><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/aplus/B00005QFL0/panasonic-handle._V192027595_.jpg" border="0" align="top"></a> <br><small><i><b>Inner bake pan offers built-in handle and nonstick coating for effortless bread removal.</b></i></small></td></tr></table> <h3>Unique Design for Professional Results</h3> <br>Unlike other bread machines, the unit does not offer a viewing window. The absence of a viewing window allows a more even reflection of heat inside the unit, which offers the following three advantages: excellent crust, good rising, and even color. The machine also benefits from a unique temperature-control program that automatically optimizes the temperatures and times for each stage of the process. Its comprehensive microprocessor program makes slight adjustments as needed to ensure perfectly baked bread regardless of conditions like climate and room temperature. <table align="left" cellpadding="10" width="460" border="0"><tr><td><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/aplus/B00005QFL0/panasonic-results._V192027592_.jpg" border="0" align="top"></a><br><small><i><b>Panasonic delivers excellent results regardless of different types of ingredients used, different seasons, and different room temperatures.</b></i></small></td></tr></table> In addition to the recipe book, accessories include a measuring spoon, a measuring cup, and a kneading blade that fits onto the base of the inner pan for thoroughly mixing ingredients.

COL title VAL "Bachmann Trains Snap - Fit E - Z Track 33.25 Radius 6 Degree Curved Track (4/Card)" COL feature VAL "Nickel Silver rail Gray roadbed E-Z Track System --Snaps Together, Stays Together on Floors, Tables and Carpets No nails, screws, or special tools needed Modeled from AAR track engineering dimensions Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track&#039;. Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power Supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. DO NOT USE STEEL WOOL TO CLEAN YOUR TRACK. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do Not Use Common Household Lubricants As They May Damage Your Trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended."

These three, must have, knives are a perfect starter collection in any kitchen. The sandwich, 8inch cooks knife and a paring knife are the most versitile kitchen knives and are used for a variety of tasks. The Wusthof Culinar brush stainless handle design is combined with a contoured shape to add comfort and control. Located in The Cutlery Capital of the World, Solingen Germany, the Wusthof factory history goes back as far as 1814 when the company was listed with the Duchy of Berg. To this day, the company remains family owned. Throughout it&#8217;s history, Wusthof has focused almost solely on the manufacturing of forged knives for the professional chef and home cooking enthusiast. Wusthof uses a special blend of German steel through out the whole length of the knife. The ingredients of this steel are proudly etched on each blade. Wusthof not only uses the best materials to make a fine knife, but it is also crucial that each blade is precisely tempered. This tempering allows the knife to hold its edge for an extremely long time, yet still be able to be maintained in your home kitchen with out the need to be sent away for maintenance. Our unique compound angle is not seen in many knives. This angle tapers from the spine of the knife to the edge to allow for a sturdy, yet extremely sharp edge while it also tapers from the bolster to the tip to give the knife strength as well as flexibility. Elegant satin-finish handles sculpted from 18/10 stainless steel distinguish Culinar cutlery from W&uuml;sthof's other cutlery lines. Otherwise Culinar knives embody all the virtues of other W&uuml;sthof knives that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. The three knives in this set exemplify that control while providing a cook with the essentials: an 8-inch cook's knife (chef's knife) for rocking through chopping and mincing tasks, a 6-inch sandwich knife for myriad slicing and cutting needs, and a 3-1/2-inch paring knife for fruits and vegetables. Like all fine cutlery, these knives should be hand washed. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Wusthof Culinar 2-Piece Starter Set" COL feature VAL "2-piece starter set includes 8-inch cook's knife and 3-1/2-inch paring knife; handsome gift box Blade, bolster, tang forged from single piece of high-carbon stainless steel Compound tapered blade is laser tested for sharpness and the correct cutting angle Handle sculpted from 18/10 stainless steel with elegant satin finish Hand washing recommended; backed by limited lifetime warranty; made in Germany" COL description VAL "The two must have knives in any kitchen are a cooks knife and a paring knife.

The Patio Bistro has a 240 square inch porcelain-coated primary cooking surface and an 80 square inch raised secondary cooking surface. Its 320 square inches of total grilling surface, large enough to accommodate 8 to 12 hamburgers. It features a temperature gauge on top of the hood for at-a-glance monitoring of the grill's temperature, a cool-touch handle, easy-to-clean porcelain-coated grill body, and a storage grate to keep your tools close at hand. When the grilling's done, simply wheel it away for easy storage. The Patio Bistro plugs into any 120-volt outlet. It measures 24.4 x 25.2 x 38.2 inches (WxDxH) and weighs 54 pounds. All Char-Broil TRU-Infrared grills generate a minimum of 65 percent infrared heat, which is evenly spread across the entire cooking surface to cook food -- without drying -- at temperatures that range from simmer to sear. Unlike traditional gas grills that use convective heat (hot air) to cook food, Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared grills limit the hot air flow and use natural, radiant heat to cook food directly without drying. While convective heat destroys food's moisture barrier, infrared heat penetrates it without drying and locks in natural juices and flavors. Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared cooking system virtually eliminates flare-ups while producing very even heat (no hot or cold spots).

All Char-Broil TRU-Infrared grills generate a minimum of 65 percent infrared heat, which is evenly spread across the entire cooking surface to cook food -- without drying -- at temperatures that range from simmer to sear. Unlike traditional gas grills that use convective heat (hot air) to cook food, Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared grills limit the hot air flow and use natural, radiant heat to cook food directly without drying. While convective heat destroys food's moisture barrier, infrared heat penetrates it without drying and locks in natural juices and flavors. Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared cooking system virtually eliminates flare-ups while producing very even heat (no hot or cold spots).

Includes 1-each 1-1/2-quart covered oval dish. The recipe for a great dish starts, surprisingly, with a great dish! Corningware French White bakeware proves that when it comes to food preparation, few things are more convenient than baking and serving in one dish. With its classic, fluted design, French White oven-to-table bakeware imparts a traditional elegance that is a perfect complement to any dcor. Versatile yet stylish, Corningware French White is simple, from start to finish! Most of us have become masters of multitasking--answering phones, checking e-mail, and reading simultaneously, and Corningware follows suit with dishes designed for the microwave, oven, tabletop, dishwasher, and refrigerator. Corningware's French White bakeware combines the functionality of classic designs with contemporary styling. This 1-1/2-quart oval baking dish is ideal for pastas, casseroles, or meats, and features a glass lid with an easy-to-grasp handle (but as with all Corningware and other ceramic or glass bakeware, you'll always need to use potholders when handling the dish or its lid). The dish itself has no handles; however, its impressive 10-year warranty (one year on the glass lid) more than compensates for this. <i>--Ariel Meadow Stallings</i>"	COL title VAL "Le Creuset Stoneware 1-1/2-Quart 9-Inch Square Baking Dish, White" COL feature VAL "1-1/2-quart square baking dish made of high-fired stoneware Non-porous enamel finish; resists odors, staining, chipping, and cracking Sure-grip side handles facilitate a steady hold during transport Dishwasher-safe; oven-safe up to 500 degrees F Measures approximately 11 by 9 by 2 inches" COL description VAL "<div class="aplus"> <!-- A+DIY for ASIN: B00004SBK0 --> <!-- Created by: Todd Densley --> <!-- Email: tdensley@lecreuset.com --> <!-- Coded with Kuramoto@ A+DIY Tool --> <h4>Le Creuset Bakeware: Le Creuset Stoneware 1-1/2-Quart 9-Inch Square Baking Dish, White</h4> <h5>From indulgent desserts and hearty casseroles to freshly baked breads and more, Le Creuset's assortment of quality bakeware ensures perfect results from the oven every time.</h5> <div class="leftImage"><img alt="Potato Au Gratin" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/aplusdiy/B00004SBK0/potato_gratin_full.jpg" /><div class="imageCaption"></div></div> Le Creuset stoneware dishes are versatile, multi-purpose designs that offer all the even-heating benefits of stoneware in a variety of shapes and capacities to fit nearly any baking, roasting or broiling recipe. Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary. This 9-1/4-inch square baker, crafted from commercial-grade  stoneware with Le Creuset's poterie glaze, cooks up a mean hot dish and  looks good doing it. Coated inside and out with the company's signature  enamel, the dish doesn't absorb moisture and resists chips, nicks,  stains, and odors. It's oven-safe to 500 degrees F and can also go in  the freezer, refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. It even looks  good at the table. The easy-grip side handles--ridged above and lipped  underneath--provide room enough for oven-mitt-sized fingers. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>"	1

The simple, urn shaped crystal is patterned with a diamond cut, and the white, soft pleat, coolie shade is excellent for diffusing light. Introduced by Waterford Crystal in 1994, the Belline table lamp is glamorous, airy, and bright. Its shape and size are suitable for grand or elegant rooms, while its structure and materials create a lovely diffuse illumination. The design starts with a smooth polished brass base, which supports the urn-like crystal body.

A soft-pleat coolie shade in white fabric tops the piece, casting a wide circle of light with its generous 20-inch diameter. Equipped with a three-way socket, the lamp is ideal for rooms that need different levels of light. It takes up to a 100-watt bulb and turns on with a rotating switch at the base of the socket.

The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Use the <b>Chop</b> function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the <b>Grind</b> function for grinding spices, and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover, and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Read to clean up? No problem! To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover, and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover, and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly, and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts."

Measures 6-1/2 by 5 by 4-Inches Since the inception of Fratelli Guzzini in 1912, innovation has been at the very core of every product design. Inspired by his personal experiences at home and abroad, Enrico Guzzini initially set out to relaunch an ancient craft by producing elegant ox horn items. Later, a younger Guzzini generation began to craft household items from Plexiglas. Reaching its next milestone in the 1960s, Raimondo Guzzini began to create a more open approach to business with the introduction of moulded acrylics while focusing on creative design concepts. By the 1980s Fratelli Guzzini began to shape into the company that it is known for today by introducing color and a creative incorporation of various materials like porcelain and glass. With many awards from all over the world, some of Guzzinis collections are showcased at the Museum of Modern Art in New York as well as the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Guzzini strives for the ideal combination of practicality and aesthetic appeal while a research team carefully considers the environmental cost. Accordingly, their products are durable enough to be used over and over again, but recyclable to prevent waste when it is time to get a new set of Guzzini products."	0

The game pieces have been modeled after the main characters from the film: Manny and Ellie (both mammoths), Diego the saber-toothed tiger, and Sid the sloth. The figures are detailed, colorful, and convincing -- certain to charm fans of the movie.<P> Players begin by arranging 24 tiles in a six by four grid at the center of the board. Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play. If they're struggling with the written instructions, they can watch the easy-to-follow video tutorial on the DVD. <P> <b>Interactive DVD Keeps Game Exciting </b><br> The entire game is played alongside the interactive DVD. With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers. For this reason, it's recommended for ages 6 and up.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, game board, 24 double-sided board tiles, 5 game movers, instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL title VAL "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire DVD Game" COL feature VAL "Hours of fun for the whole family Play the world's greatest quiz game on your DVD player Hosted by Meredith Vieira Play just like the game show Do you have what it takes to be a Millionaire?"

With its ski feet, the Model 1 can be used on many natural terrains to lock into place for accuracy and comfort. Perfect for porous surfaces i.e. mud, clay, soggy grass, etc. Plus the All-Steel construction gives the bipod an almost unbreakable body. The legs have ski feet that extend from 9 inches to 12 inches. Includes (1) One Tactical Universal Bipod Rest Mounting Adapter (150-200) with the axial rotation "Cant" feature. Here at KFS Industries, we believe our products can only be as good as the materials used in the build. While it may cost more to use better materials, the end result is a solid product built to pass down for generations to come. Our competitors use Sheet metal construction, which will allow the bipods to flex and possibly bend with heavier recoiling weapons. Versa-Pod bipod legs are machined from solid billets (aluminum or steel depending on model) and include positive locking notches eliminating movement. With other manufactures, the legs have radial grooves which are lathe turned -simple and cheap. The groove all the way around weakens the entire bipod leg. Our locking notches are individually machined ONLY where the latch locks the leg  more expensive, but much stronger. Solid milled materials eliminate bipod flex, allowing for more consistent precision and a stable platform to shoot from. These are very important points to consider when you are choosing you next bipod. Try the Versa-Pod and you will feel the difference!"
