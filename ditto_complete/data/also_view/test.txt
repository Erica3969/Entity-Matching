It is not necessary to add supplemental vitamins or minerals. Food consumption can vary during gestation. Feed the amount needed to maintain ideal body condition in the pregnant female. After kittens are born, feed the nursing female all she wants to eat. Food intake can be 2(en)3 times greater by the fourth week of lactation as it was prior to when the female was bred. Food intake can be increased by feeding Pro Plan moistened with water and feeding twice daily. Kitten Feeding: Kittens generally nibble solid foods at 3(en)4 weeks of age. Keep moistened Pro Plan available to these kittens at all times. After weaning, at 6(en)8 weeks of age, kittens will normally eat dry or moistened food at will. If water is added, use no more than one part warm (not hot) liquid to three parts Pro Plan, changing frequently to ensure freshness. As kittens near adulthood, their calorie needs may decrease. Continue to adjust the amount you feed to maintain your kitten in ideal body condition and avoid excess weight gain. Making the Switch to Pro Plan: Although you'll be anxious to see the difference Pro Plan can make in your kitten, please allow 7(en)10 days to ease the transition from your kitten's current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Pro Plan until you're feeding Pro Plan exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly. Store in a cool, dry place.

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 5-inch blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a wide point. The serrated edge is perfect for cutting and slicing soft products that have a firm skin, as this type of blade penetrates more easily than one with a smooth edge. This medium-size knife makes a handy and versatile kitchen tool for cooks of any ilk. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A.

These beautiful pieces with their bold classic colors go straight from baking to the table, then to the refrigerator or freezer for storage. ... These pretty little ramekins are a bit different in style than the traditional vertically rippled cups that look like miniature souffl&eacute; dishes. The tall, smooth sides are only interrupted by three horizontal ridges--it's a clean look, and actually makes them more practical. They're easier to grab from under the hot broiler and also easier to scrub clean after use--no more caramelized sugar trapped in the ripples! The smooth interior flares just slightly at the top to provide a broader surface area for that tasty top layer. Each ramekin holds up to 8 ounces when filled to the very brim, and goes easily from freezer to oven or microwave--terrific for make-ahead fruit crisps or cobblers. This two-pack is great for replenishing a broken set or as a stand-alone set for a couple. <I>--Jill Lightner</I>"	0

COL title VAL "Jafco Black Plastic Muzzle" COL feature VAL "Please refer to sizing chart photo & instructions below Designed to be worn for extended periods Prevents wound licking, eating rocks, garbage, poison, etc Helps with dominant and aggressive dog training" COL description VAL "The Jafco Muzzle has been around for years. It is a plastic basket muzzle that offers a great deal of security, and they go on a lot easier than most muzzles. They come in different sizes, please refer to sizing chart and instructions below. If you are looking for a good utility muzzle that will last for years and years, this is your best choice. All are made with polyethylene plastic with three reinforced rubber straps. The clear plastic muzzle is softer and more flexible than the white or black style plastic muzzles. These muzzles are not designed for muzzle fighting training. DESIGN & USES Can be worn for extended periods without inhibiting the dogs breathing, barking, and panting. Dogs can drink with the muzzle on, using a water bowl or bucket. It is best to "teach" your dog that it is okay to put the muzzle into the water before leaving the dog unattended for any period of time. Prevents wound licking, and eating rocks, garbage, poison, etc. Prevents injuries from dog fights. Allows dogs to use some modes of transportation when properly muzzled, which some transportation companies require. FITTING THE DOG The vinyl nose piece should be just below the dogs stop with the end of the muzzle touching the dogs nose. When on the dog: pull the muzzle out and down; pull the muzzle out and up. If at some point the muzzle comes off, its either too loose or too big. The muzzle should fit comfortably and allow the dog to pant and bark. SIZING TIPS & CHART There are a few things you need to know about sizing a muzzle for your dog: The muzzle cannot be longer than your dogs actual "nose length". If the muzzle is longer than your dog's nose length, the muzzle will be in the dog's line of vision. The muzzle's circumference must be larger than your dog's "nose circumference." We recommend between one and three inches larger than your dog's measurement. If the muzzle is the exact same size as your dog's nose, the dog won't be able to pant."

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM "tent cities" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, Eurekas new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition. For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Womens Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian. <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering. "	0

The combined riveted handle design is combined with a contoured shape to add comfort and control. The handles are made of a durable synthetic material that is extremely comfortable to use. The Classic Ikon adds a rear bolster that acts as a counter balance when using the knife. This second bolster adds significant blade control. Classic Ikon has a unique forward bolster as well. The forward partial bolster is designed so you can sharpen the complete length of the blade. This bolster is also curved inwards to allow your fingers greater control while holding the knife by the blade. Wusthof uses a special blend of German steel through out the whole length of the knife. The ingredients of this steel are proudly etched on each blade. Wusthof not only uses the best materials to make a fine knife, but it is also crucial that each blade is precisely tempered. This tempering allows the knife to hold its edge for an extremely long time, yet still be able to be maintained in your home kitchen with out the need to be sent away for maintenance. Our unique compound angle is not seen in many knives. This angle tapers from the spine of the knife to the edge to allow for a sturdy, yet extremely sharp edge while it also tapers from the bolster to the tip to give the knife strength as well as flexibility. Located in "The Cutlery Capital of the World", Solingen Germany, the Wusthof factory history goes back as far as 1814 when the company was listed with the Duchy of Berg. To this day, the company remains family owned."	0

Adams: A 2nd-Generation, Family-Owned Company</h4> Kitchen storage solutions by J.K. Adams make it easy to save on valuable kitchen space while enjoying the best of USA-made craftsmanship. The family-owned company provides everything from pot hooks and spice bottles to wooden spice carousels, kitchen-knife blocks, bread boxes, wine racks, pot racks, and more. J.K. Adams' wooden kitchen items feature renewable and sustainable wood in Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, or Hickory varieties. A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving "carousel" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K. Adams has continued to lead and inspire the kitchen storage market with their innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and exemplary craftsmanship. Some of the world's finest woodworkers can be found in New England. The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K. Adams' success is certainly attributable to the early Vermonters employed by the company while in its infancy who brought forth the techniques and quality craftsmanship that could only come from generations of shared knowledge and experience. The J.K. Adams factory has been at the same location since the beginning. As many as three generations of families have relied on J.K. Adams to provide for their families. Located in a rural area of Vermont, J.K. Adams remains one of the largest employers in the area and is an important pillar of support for the local community. J.K. Adams has always used the creativity and skill of their workforce in developing new products, and today J.K. Adams continues its New England craftsmanship with a wide variety of cutting boards, as well as wooden salad bowls, kitchen islands, and slate serving trays. And at the J.K. Adams factory, you'll find future generations of woodworkers building upon the traditions begun over 65 years ago. Cutting boards and other products by J.K Adams are made in the North America. In colonial New England, three strokes of a broad ax were used to mark the finest trees in the forest for the Queens' Navy shipmasts. The broad arrow was adopted as our logo because it symbolizes the exceptional quality of wood that goes into our products. Wood is naturally anti-bacterial, and any bacteria left on the board will actually lessen in time versus multiplying on a plastic cutting board. A wooden board will also be more gentle on your knife's edge, and it just feels and sounds better under a knife. Wash by hand in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly, and oil frequently with mineral oil to help give it an optimal appearance. Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen. For storage, keep the board away from strong sunlight as avoiding UV rays will reduce the risk of fading."	1

COL description VAL "RPM Axle Carriers, Black: 1/16 EVR/SLH, RPM73162 There is very little that can be as frustrating on an R/C vehicle as slop in the suspension system. In the case of the 1/16th scale E-Revo, Slash & Rally, there is absolutely no slop adjustment for the suspension pivot balls. Once the axle carriers begin to wear at those balls, the camber, toe and caster angles dont stay true, causing the vehicle to wander, making it very difficult to control. That is where RPM steps in. Our new 1/16th scale Axle Carriers have a unique pivot ball retention system that locks the pivot ball in place, yet still allows for adjustment due to wear. Our system is based on a cap design, held in place with a pair of small screws. Simply slip the caps in place, tighten the flathead screws until the free play of the pivot ball is eliminated and youre ready to go! RPM Axle Carriers have been completely redesigned for added durability and crash-survivability. RPM engineers found that the stock pivot ball opening could be reduced in size to help support the pivot ball better, meaning a significantly lower chance of pulling the ball through the hole. The redesigned overall shape and superior materials that go into our version make them the best alternative at the lowest price available! And to top it off, RPM axle carriers are marginally lighter than the stock versions! RPM Axle Carriers for the 1/16th scale Traxxas E-Revo, Slash & Rally are molded in three color options  black, blue and red, perfectly matching our already well-known and respected set of mini E-Revo A-arms.

Because fruits and vegetables "breathe" and require varying amounts of air each container has two vents. The containers' bottoms also have raised grids to elevate produce above its own moisture and prevent spoilage. The vents open and shut with the touch of a finger. High-rate breathers like artichokes and spinach need both vents open. Medium-rate breathers like cabbage and citrus require one open vent. Low-rate breathers like asparagus and berries stay prime with both vents closed. (A chart of various items' needs is included.) The rugged plastic containers are also terrific for ripening tomatoes, apples, pears, and bananas on the counter. The set consists of a rectangular 19-1/2-cup container (14-3/4 inches long, 4-3/4 inches wide, 5 inches high), a rectangular 7-cup container (8-3/4 inches long, 5-3/4 inches wide, 3-1/2 inches high), and a square 4-1/2-cup container (5-3/4 inches square, 3-1/4 inches high).

You regulate the airflow within the container thanks to a completely unique, new venting system. Different fruits and vegetables require different amounts of airflow to stay fresh - FridgeSmart Containers know that and create optimal storage conditions for different produce right in your refrigerator. Special built-in grid lifts food away from condensation. Result? No more yellow broccoli and wasted celery - just delicious, healthy fruits and vegetables for the whole family to enjoy all week long! Say goodbye to soggy lettuce and vegetables with this Fridgesmart storage container. Tupperwares unique ACE (Atmosphere Controlled Environment) venting system allows just the right amount of air into the container by means of two vents on the end of the box. Flip open one or both vents, depending on whats inside--a handy guide gives venting recommendations. For instance, broccoli likes a lot of air, zucchini very little. Raised ridges on the bottom of the container allow condensation to drain away from produce, maintaining freshness. Decorated with a wavy line pattern, the textured lid reduces sliding when another container is stacked on top. While the lid creates a tight seal, some effort is required to remove it. The container and lid are dishwasher-safe but should not be used in a microwave. This storage container measures 9 by 6 by 3-1/2 inches and, like all Tupperware products, carries a lifetime warranty against chipping, cracking, breaking, and peeling. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>"	1

Designed as a no-bypass system, debris remains caught between each pleat until it is removed and rinsed. The effectiveness of the Fluval G6 pre-filtration process means that less solid waste is solubilised in the aquarium water for less waste accumulation and also makes the chemical and biological filtration components of the system more effective. <div class="aplus"> <div> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> The Fluval G6 Pre-filter is a daily use cartridge for the Fluval G6 Advanced Filter and will trap suspended debris for effective mechanical filtration in fresh or marine applications.

Fluval G-Nodes Biological Filtration Media feature a complex pore system where beneficial bacterial will thrive. With more capacity and a shape that enables them to be compacted tightly within the G filter baskets, the G-Nodes enhance biological nitrification, and help reduce ammonia and nitrite. The Fluval G6 redefines the filtration category by offering a unique combination of aesthetics, monitoring capabilities and performance features.the G Series is a stunningly attractive, high-tech marvel that features a stylish cubic design The Fluval G Series is equipped with HydroTech,  an intelligent monitoring system. Though internal sensory modules, the HydroTech microprocessor stores and communicates real time filter performance, water parameters and filter cleaning intervals. The flow rate is permanently highlighted on the screen as well as aquarium water temperature and conductivity. To let you know when filter maintenance is required, scheduling is also displayed. The Fluval G is powered by an advanced three component drive system, providing power, long term reliability with virtually zero noise and high performance. The powerful yet compact synchronized dual drive coil is controlled by one of two Fluval G microprocessors which continuously monitor and adjust the start speed, impeller direction, power usage and performance. The inner filter chamber is made from fiberglass re-enforced polymer, designed to withstand pressures of 15PSI, far outweighing the normal operational standards and resulting in a leak-proof and noise reducing casing. With its proprietary technology the AquaStop system makes maintenance easy, allowing you to stop the water flow by simply bringing the AquaStop valve lever into an upright position.By lifting the AquaStop release lever, the complete assembly can be conveniently removed without separating the hosing Chrome plated cast ZAMA levers provide a strong and secure seal and do not corrode or oxidize even when in contact with salt water. They are made of Zamak alloy which provides superior strength and dimensional stability over time. With the Fluval G, there's never a need for manual siphoning. After set up on the aquarium and before plugging the unit in, just push the easy priming button all the way down 2-3 times in fast sequence. As water is drawn through the intake hosing, it fills the canister pushing air out of its way. Water is drawn through the multi-lamella intake strainer, designed to repel debris and resist the build-up of solids that would normally impede water flow. Additional intake strainers can be attached to extend the intake screen surface.

As players move their pieces around the board, they uncover tools such as a boat, key, or magic potion. These are used to get past six obstacles that guard the princess: a moat, a guard dog, a sentry, a locked door, a dark tunnel, and a magic spell. It's a race against time, because in addition to objects, the board contains spaces that advance the coming of the night and the end of the game. Cooperation comes into play when players help each other come up with creative uses for the various objects. The horse, for example, might be used to swim the moat or run past the dog, or might be traded to the guard as a bribe. Since all players are working toward a common goal, everyone wins or loses as a team."	1

ZWILLING Special Formula, high carbon no-stain steel blades are FRIODUR ice-hardened to be durable, stay sharp, and not rust. Classic Triple Riveted Handle for comfort, durability and strength. Made in Spain, lifetime warranty. Removed from their slots in this set's rubber-footed wood storage block, these eight knives slice any steak, chop, or roast into bite-size pieces. Gourmet is one of Henckels's inexpensive cutlery lines. These knives don't have bolsters, but that feature isn't vital when confronting a rib eye. The high-carbon, stainless-steel 4-1/2-inch blades are stamped, not forged, and because they are serrated on the upper halves, they tend to tear meat fibers rather than slice precisely through them the way straight-edge knives do. On the other hand, the fine serrations reduce the tearing effect, and the blades' lower halves are straight.

Plus, the included six-slot oak block keeps the set within reach on the countertop. Part of Wsthof's Gourmet series of knives, these steak knives are a less expensive version of the manufacturer's Classic series of cutlery. Although the blades are still made of high-carbon steel with a stain-resistant alloy, the difference is that they are made of a thinner quality metal and are cut by a precision laser instead of by hand. The blades still have an ideal shape as they are ground and polished by computer to ensure perfect tapering from tip to bolster. Full tangs extend through the synthetic traditional-style handles, which are triple-riveted for strength. These knives are dishwasher-safe but hand washing is recommended to preserve the edges on the blades. The Gourmet series is an excellent alternative for those who want to own quality Wsthof cutlery but are on a budget. <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>"	1

Dogs have the natural compulsion to chew in order to relieve stress or cure boredom. This is especially true for puppies. For any dog, the need to chew is an urge that must be satisfied. Instead of sacrificing your shoes to the puppy's chewing urge, give the dog something beneficial to chew with CET's brand of chews. These chewy strips work like rawhide pieces to help your dog exercise his natural need to chew. They also prevent excess stress on the teeth and gums. Unlike rawhide, the CET HEXtra Premium Chews contain chlorhexidine, an antiseptic that helps clean your dog's mouth every time the dog chomps down on the CET chews.

COL title VAL "Horizon Fitness EX-77 Elliptical Trainer" COL feature VAL "Elliptical trainer with 16 electronic resistance levels and heavy-duty 14-pound flywheel 12-plus on-the-fly programming options plus 2 custom programs Orange LED display with scrolling text plus 2 small orange LED displays Multi-position handgrips for added variety; 18-to-19-inch variable stride length Measures 26 x 76 x 72 inches (W x H x D); lifetime warranty on brake and frame" COL description VAL "The Horizon EX-77 elliptical offers a lot of training options and premium features in one compact unit. It's designed with over 14 workout programs, up to 16-degree elevation, multi-position handgrips, contact heart rate grips, and power include so you can make workouts even more challenging and target specific muscle groups. The orange LED screen keeps track of your progress and the MP3 port, speakers and headphone jack help make your workout more enjoyable. Enjoy a fun and invigorating total body workout without leaving the home with the Horizon EX77 elliptical trainer, which works your legs as well as your upper body. Perfect for rigorous training routines, the EX77 offers a 16-level electronic resistance system, along with a heavy-duty 14-pound flywheel that maintains pedal and arm momentum while offering a smooth, quiet operation. More significantly from a user perspective, the trainer offers over 14 workout programs. Choose one of three different goals (time, distance, and calories) and one of four terrains (manual, reverse train, and hills). Meanwhile, the three orange LED displays offer key workout feedback, helping you develop an effective training regimen. Horizon employs a heavy-duty flywheel that provides continuous velocity, so as your feet move the pedals, the flywheel's momentum carries you through the complete motion. As a result, the trainer feels very natural and not at all choppy. Plus, the flywheel is extremely quiet, making the trainer ideal for home use. Horizon also applies a magnetic brake to the flywheel, creating more consistent resistance during a workout. And the instep-stacked flywheel design--where the flywheel sits above the pedals rather than in line with them--delivers a lower step-on height for easy access, along with a stride length that's longer, more natural, and more versatile regardless of the user, workout type, and fitness level. Horizon's Ergoflow elliptical geometry is built around your body, not the machine's components. While the over-sized foot pedals provide maximum comfort, the distance between them has been narrowed to create a more natural walking motion, and the pivoting footpad imitates how your foot's position changes as you move forward. And a more natural, ergonomic movement means less stress on your knees, hips, and lowers back, so you enjoy longer workouts and faster results. Other details include an MP3 port with speakers and audio-in/out jacks, multi-position handgrips, contact heart-rate grips, a built-in cooling fan, and an 18-inch stride length with Custom Stride flexibility. <table align=right width=334 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/horizon-ex77.jpg" border=0 align=top><br><br><small><i><b>The EX77's 8-digit LED alphanumeric screen and 2 amber LED screens display heart rate and other key workout feedback.</b></i></small></td></tr></table> <b>Elliptical Trainer Features:</b><ul> <li>Resistance: Electronic <li>Resistance range: 1 to 16 resistance levels <li>Flywheel: 14-pound flywheel for fluid, quiet motion <li>Step-on height: 16.5 inches <li>Stride length: 18 to 19 inches, variable <li>Pedal spacing: 2.4 inches <li>Screen: 1 orange LED alphanumeric with scrolling text (0.6 x 3.15 inches) and 2 orange 4-digit LEDs (0.71 x 2 inches) <li>Programs: 14-plus <li>Program type: Your choice of 3 goals and 4 terrains can be modified at any point during workout, plus 2 custom programs <li>MP3 port: Yes <li>Audio in/out jacks: Yes <li>MP3 holder: Yes <li>Contact heart rate grips: Yes <li>Weight capacity: 300 pounds <li>Dimensions: 26 x 76 x 72 inches (W x H x D) <li>Weight: 220 pounds <li>Warranties: Lifetime on frame and brake; 1 year on incline motor, parts and labor </ul> <b>About Horizon Fitness</b><br> Horizon is part of Johnson Health Tech, one of the largest manufacturers of fitness equipment in the world.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Many elliptical trainers include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

They also work well for keeping pasta, rice, flour, sugar, crackers, cookies, and other cupboard or pantry items fresh for longer, securely stored, and neatly organized. Even more, the versatile storage containers can be used to transport lunches to and from work or school--or even for storing smaller kitchen, office, or craft items. Lock&Lock's full line of Classic food-storage containers offers a wide range of shapes and sizes--each with a securely locking lid for airtight storage and peace of mind. Furthermore, the clear body of the containers makes identifying contents easy--no labels required. Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers feature an innovative four-sided locking system for an airtight seal and watertight storage so food stays fresh longer and there's no messy leaks or spills to worry about. The four sides of the locking system promote an airtight seal due to equal pressure to all four sides, along with the hollow-center silicon sealing ring that makes it possible to lock tightly (the silicone sealing ring can be removed for cleaning if necessary). Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers not only offer an airtight and watertight seal, but they're also durably built for unbreakable, long-lasting use and hygienic, food-safe storage. The containers can withstand temperatures ranging from -4 degrees F to 210 degrees F, making them suitable for use in the freezer, microwave* (reheating only), and dishwasher (top-rack). The base and lid should NOT be used in the oven, under browning elements, or on the stove top. Another thoughtful design detail includes the fact that the containers can be nested together, and with the lid in place, they can be stacked one on top of the other--particularly useful where space is limited. *Unlock all four latches and loosen lid before use in microwave. Lock&Lock Classic lids feature four side flaps or "wings" that are hinged and slightly flared at the end for an easy grip when opening. More importantly, they come with holes (rectangular-shaped openings) that line up with matching knobs on the base of the containers, making it easy to latch the lid to the base, locking it into place. This patented blocking hole system maintains the integrity of the lid and helps promote an easy, tightly locked container. In addition to its blocking hole system, the Classic food-storage containers feature a blue hollow-center silicon ring in the lid that helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Generic silicon with a solid center doesn't compress as well and doesn't have the same restorative power as hollow-center silicon, which means an inferior seal. Lock&Lock's hollow-center silicon seal delivers superior compression and restoration power that helps ensure an airtight seal. When testing the freshness of foods, one of the most important factors is the permeability of the container. In comparison to other brands, the permeability of Lock&Lock products showed to be drastically better. The freshness test is determined throughout the world by how much moisture permeates various containers. Test results show Lock&Lock airtight containers allow in 3,000 - 6,000 times less moisture than other containers, making them far more airtight. Lock&Lock airtight containers passed the leakage test. Their four-sided locking system makes an airtight seal possible due to equal pressure on all four sides and the hollow-center silicone sealing ring. <div class="rightImage" style="width:130px"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/lockandlock/B0054PHG2Q-kemti.jpg" width="130" height="91" alt="Lock&Lock Classic" /> <div class="imageCaption">Passed the KEMTI bending test.</div></div> <h5>Durable Design</h5> Lock&Lock airtight containers have also passed the KEMTI bending test. The container and the wing were fixed to the bending test machine and bent 3,000,000 times 80 degrees left to right. If the container were to be used 10 times a day, it could be used for 821 years (semi-permanently). <div class="leftImage" style="width:145px"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/lockandlock/B0054PHG2Q-healthy.jpg" width="132" height="92" alt="Lock&Lock Classic" /> <div class="imageCaption">Hygienic and food-safe.</div></div> <h5>Healthy Living</h5> Lock&Lock Classic food-storage containers have passed the strict hygiene and safety tests of the U.S. FDA and German SGS. Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, the durable and heat-resistance containers are food-safe and health-friendly. When not in use, the cleverly designed food-storage containers nest together, both lids and bases, for compact storage in a drawer or on a shelf. The containers also offer a stacking system for maximum space efficiency. The flat lids make it easy to stack one container on top of another--a slight edge helps to keep stacked items in securely place, whether in the freezer, refrigerator, or cupboard. Whether just one or building a collection of several, Lock&Lock's Classic airtight containers offer a smart solution for food storage."

The high quality carbon provides a large porous area to trap minute particles. Besides providing a small sieve for mechanical trapping of organic wastes, carbon also removes liquid wastes from water. These include urine, dyes or impurities in solution. This action provides sparkling clear water in the aquarium. The large internal surface area also provides numerous points for important bacterial colonies to form and thrive. Carbon should always be removed during medication. It has also been recently noted that carbon will adsorb a large percentage of many of the nutrients in plant fertilizer products. As such, it should be used carefully when keeping live plants. Carbon loses its activity without outward sign. In general, carbon should be replaced on a monthly basis to ensure that active adsorption is maintained. <div class="aplus"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> <h5>Fluval Carbon</h5> Fluval Carbon Filter Media Insert is capable of adsorbing most liquified impurities and dyes present in aquarium water.

Includes a special rack for cooking several foods at once with no intermingling of flavors. Dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. Liquid capacity: 4 quarts (3.8 liters). Pressure cookers have experienced renewed popularity over the last several years because cooks have rediscovered what some cooks (particularly grandmas) have known for a long time--they're really fast. And it's easy to cook healthfully with pressure cookers, since the food retains so much more of its nutrients and flavor.

Chicken Cacciatore cooks in 8 minutes! This durable, polished-aluminum pressure cooker is an economical addition to any well-rounded set of kitchen tools. The heavy-duty lid locks down during cooking; an inner sealing ring keeps the steam in. In addition to a pop-up pressure indicator and a simple steam release mechanism, there is an overpressure plug that will let off steam if it builds up excessively. This pressure cooker is useful for weeknight dinners or for any meal that needs to come together quickly. An accompanying booklet contains more than 65 recipes, ranging from basic soup stocks to stews and pot roast--even desserts like Oatmeal-Apple Crisp! Tenderize lean cuts of beef or pork; or cook chicken, fish, or vegetables faster than you can in a microwave, and without losing moisture. Nonabrasive cleansers are best for cleaning this polished aluminum pressure cooker, though occasional use of a fine metal polish will help the exterior keep its shine. The Presto 4-quart aluminum pressure cooker is fully immersible; in addition, the sealing ring should be removed after each use to allow cleaning of the inside rim of the lid. The vent pipe is simple to keep clean with a small brush or pipe cleaner, and both the air vent/cover lock and the overpressure plug are removable. The pressure cooker measures 9 inches in diameter (14 inches including handle) and 7 inches tall (including lid). Presto guarantees this pressure cooker with an extended 12-year warranty. A detailed instruction and recipe booklet is included; special safety issues that pertain to pressure cookers are clearly explained. <i>--Garland Withers</i>"	1

From the Manufacturer In 1971, Braun launched a series of travel alarm clocks and watches. The infamous German industrial designers, Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs were the masterminds behind the project; and, with their "Less, is more" design philosophy they produced a number of memorable products for Braun including some of the best travel alarm clocks around. Over the last 40 years, Braun time pieces were characterized by their pure, highly functional and timeless design with no superfluous details: Every feature directly reflects a function. Rooted in over half a century of modern design at Braun, the core values of functionality, quality and aesthetics are reflected in all clocks and watches. The strength of clarity and simplicity of their design makes them a pleasure to use and to own. The analogue clocks were manufactured with the intention to prioritize innovation and durability. The beautifully sleek structure and dial illumination, together with the slight graying back of the numbers ensures that the hour arms are clear and easily readable. All the clocks use precision German movements, known for their silent nature and high accuracy. A variety of models use radio controlled movements for complete accuracy of time. A selection of the very best classic clocks and watches have been recreated in keeping with the high standards of quality of the originals. At the same time, brand new designs on both watches and clocks take the collection further than ever before"	0

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 5-inch blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a wide point. The serrated edge is perfect for cutting and slicing soft products that have a firm skin, as this type of blade penetrates more easily than one with a smooth edge. This medium-size knife makes a handy and versatile kitchen tool for cooks of any ilk. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keepers Friend. To use the Bar Keepers Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keepers Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keepers Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

The durable and heat-resistant glass beaker is partially encased by the black plastic frame of the New Kenya coffee maker. The frame covers a part of the sides and bottom of the beaker, making it safe for the tabletop without using a trivet or coaster. Simple to use, the French press is a proven method for brewing flavorful and balance coffee. Coffee is measured in 4 oz. cups, so our 8-cup press will brew 34 oz., serving three to four people. For best results, use coarse ground coffee. Just add the appropriate amount of ground coffee to the beaker (we recommend one 7 gram scoop per 4 oz. of water). Fill the beaker with hot water (just off of a boil). Leave about an inch from the top of the beaker. Give the coffee a stir with a plastic or wooden utensil to mix it completely with the water. Set the plunger and lid unit in place with the safety lid in the closed position. Allow the coffee to brew for 4-minutes and then press. Turn the safety lid to the open position, serve and enjoy. Clean up is easy too &#8211; just scoop out the grounds with a rubber spatula, and rinse the beaker and filter. There is no paper or additional filter required. The 3-part stainless steel filter system is built right into the press. The stay cool handle is built right into the sturdy New Kenya frame. All parts are dishwasher safe. The New Kenya is also available in 3, 4, and 6 cup sizes. Freshly designed with swooping curves, the black plastic frame on the New Kenya coffee press adds to the anticipation of the morning coffee. And good coffee indeed this press makes. Most aficionados agree that the French press, or plunger, style of coffee maker produces the smoothest cup of joe. Bodum makes the carafe itself of borosilicate glass, the lightweight, heat-resistant kind found in science labs, and the plunger and three-piece filter system of stainless steel. The plastic frame tightly wraps the glass beaker and protects your table from its heat. The lid is also plastic. To make coffee in the New Kenya, put in the glass carafe one scoop of coarse-ground coffee beans per every four ounces of brewed coffee you intend to make. Add nearly-boiling water, stir with a silicone spatula, and place the filter-plunger-lid unit in the top. After four minutes of brewing, slowly press down on the plunger. Pour, and enjoy. Use the same spatula to scrape the grounds out afterward, and rinse out the carafe and assembly. All the parts are dishwasher-safe as well. The largest of the New Kenya presses, this size makes 34 ounces of coffee, which fills approximately three mugs or eight four-ounce after-dinner cups. <I>--Ann Bieri</I> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cookstools/aci.bodum.sm.jpg" align="left"></td> <td> <P> <B>Awards and Accolades</B><P> In 2004 the Bodum Chambord coffee press received the American Culinary Institute's award for best French press coffeemaker.

Times were difficult at the end of World War II; there was hardly any trade and people were out of work. Peter Bodum managed to wholesale a very small variety of housewares products by Danish manufacturers. After the war Peter Bodum got an import license for kitchen and tabletop products; he traveled all over Europe and ended up importing kitchen and housewares to Denmark. As in the rest of Europe in those days, a lack of products in Denmark meant a market existed for almost anything to be sold. He specialized in glassware from Eastern Europe. In the '50s Peter Bodum started developing his own products. He collaborated with the Danish architect Kaas Klaeson for a range of coffeemakers. At the time, industrial-design-type kitchen products were very rare. The first Bodum product to hit the market in 1958 was the Santos coffeemaker--based on a vacuum coffee brewing system. It became an instant sensation not only in Denmark but in all of Europe. Bodum still produces the original Santos design to this very day. Bodum grew steadily during the '60s, but sadly, in 1967, at the age of only 57, Peter Bodum passed away. His wife managed the company until 1974, when she offered her 26-year-old son Joergen to join her in the management of the company. Joergen quickly brought on board Carsten Joergensen--then a teacher at the Danish School of Art in Copenhagen--and soon put him in charge of overall design for Bodum, including everything from products to corporate design, exhibitions, shops, buildings, catalogs, and advertising. It turned out to be a very long and fruitful collaboration. The two men began to fulfill Bodum's credo--"good design doesn't have to be expensive"--in lots of different ways. In 1974 the first fruit of Joergen and Carsten's collaboration was introduced: the French coffee press Bistro. It was also the first incorporation of the new Bodum design language--beautiful simplicity and excellent materials for everyday life. Many more variations of coffee presses followed. Since 1974 Bodum has produced over 50 million French presses, taken the leap from "coffee" to "kitchen," and developed and produced a large variety of beautiful household and tabletop designs. In 1979, when he took over the company, Joergen Bodum decided to move to Switzerland in order to be more centrally located in Europe. He chose the Lucerne area, where Bodum's head office has been located since the early '80s. In 1980 Bodum Switzerland and its design unit, Pi-Design, were founded. Then, in 1986, the opening of Bodum's first shop in London marked another milestone in the Bodum history. It was designed not only to be the perfect showcase for the large variety of Bodum products but to embody an even stronger presentation of Bodum as an international brand. Many more shops in many more cities all over the world followed: Paris, Copenhagen, Zurich, Lucerne, Tokyo, New York, Dallas, Okinawa, Auckland, and many more. To this day there are 52 Bodum stores worldwide. With more and more of its own stores in place, Bodum continued broadening its collection of beautifully designed everyday life products--from kitchen to home. Today Bodum offers its customers everything from the latest coffee- and tea-making products to tabletop, kitchen, storage, textiles, bathroom, and home office products.

Should your Suspended Ceiling system be in size 24" x 48" you might consider converting to a 24"x 24" Grid or glue two 24" x 24" to your 24" x 48" ceiling tile."	0

COL description VAL "The first one to get a full set of princess jewelry and the crown wins. Pretty Pretty Princess is an easy-to-play game for two to four children who like to dress up. Each player picks a colored piece in pink, green, blue, or purple and takes a turn spinning the wheel on the jewelry box to advance around the circular game board. Each space on the board guides the player to pick a piece of jewelry that matches the color of his or her playing piece, or to put one back in the jewelry box. The goal is to be decked out in full princess regalia. There is only one crown, and it can also be picked from the jewelry box or off the royal brow of some other would-be princess. Aspiring sovereigns should beware the black ring--you definitely don't want to be stuck with it at the end of the game. The game includes plastic bracelets, necklaces, rings, earrings, a crown, and a jewelry box with a spinner and a mirror. There are "jewel" stickers to decorate the jewelry box and the crown (but the stickers should not be put on skin or clothing). There's a charming simplicity in this game for little ones who dream of being a princess. Players move their pieces around the game board collecting plastic costume jewelry, such as rings, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets. The winner of the game is the one who collects the crown and all the jewels that match their playing color. That player is the princess who now turns over the spinner to reveal a mirror into which she can gaze at her royal self. Game play includes the dreaded black ring, which no one wants but someone might get. Sticky jewels are included to decorate the jewelry box and the crown. For young children with royal fantasies, Pretty Pretty Princess is pretty pretty good. <I>--Lee Strucker</I>"	COL title VAL "PRETTY PRETTY PRINCESS Game (2009 Edition) by Milton Bradley" COL feature VAL "Pretty Pretty Princess Board Game Milton Bradley Become a Princess in this fun jewelry dress up game!

The optimum thickness of the pan base prevents warping and keeps the pan base perfectly flat, especially important when used with glass top or ceramic ranges.

Cast of 18/10 stainless steel for stay-cool stovetop use, the two side handles are ergonomic for comfort and riveted for strength. Both the handles and stainless-steel lid stylishly present a dual matte/polished finish that handsomely contrasts with the black pan body. Scanpan Professional pans are safe for any burner type, including induction; oven-use up to 500 degrees F; and dishwasher-cleaning, although washing by hand will best preserve the nonstick finish. In response to environmental concerns regarding nonstick finishes, Scanpan in 2007 introduced its Green Tek nonstick technology. Working with its suppliers, Scanpan is the first cookware company to completely eliminate the use of the harmful chemical PFOA from the entire process used to make its nonstick compound. The new PFOA-free nonstick finish is now found on all Scanpan Classic and Professional cookware. Scanpan covers its cast-aluminum cookware with a full lifetime warranty. <I>--Ann Bieri</I> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/green-tek-logo.jpg" align="left"></td> <td> <P> <B>About Green Tek Nonstick Technology:</B><P> In the more recent past, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken the leading manufacturer of nonstick compounds to task over excessive emissions of PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid). PFOA has been used as a catalyst in the production of PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene), the basic building block for all nonstick cookware surfaces. PFOA is a chemical that is hard to break down in the environment. It has a half life of 3.8 years, meaning that if there are 4 grams of PFOA in the body today, the body will have 2 grams in it in four years from now, 1 gram in eight years from now and so on. The human metabolism does not remove PFOA. While it is not a carcinogen or toxin and is generally assumed inert and not harmful to your health, it is environmentally unfriendly and just sticks around forever. That is why the EPA and the leading nonstick manufacturer have agreed that by 2010, the amount of PFOA used to produce PTFE compounds need to be cut by 95%, and by 2015 no PFOA could be used, at all. Towards the end of this process, PFOA is completely extracted via ionization filters. Even if any traces of PFOA were still present by the time the nonstick compound reached the cookware factory, the pan surface curing temperatures would destroy such remnants. The same is true for the old nonstick compound used for Scanpan Classic and Scanpan Professional. That&#146;s why Scanpan has always been able to present the finished product as not containing PFOA. <td> </tr> </table> <B></B><P> Scanpan Cookware has always been PFOA free, but the negative publicity that PFOA and, by extension, PTFE had received over the last few years, had caused Scanpan to work closely with their suppliers to find a substitute for PFOA that is biodegradable. Scanpan received patents on PFOA-free technology in 2007 and has been producing Scanpan Classic and Scanpan Professional with this new process since spring 2007. With their new Green Tek technology, there is no PFOA used at any stage of the entire process, resulting in a "clean and green" nonstick PTFE compound, the production of which no longer uses chemicals that could have a negative impact on the environment. The performance of the Scanpan Green Tek surface is not different in any way from the performance of Scanpan's previous surface. And Scanpan continues to incorporate their patented ceramic-titanium technology. Scanpan is safe to use with metal utensils and each piece comes with a lifetime warranty. <B>Taking Care of Scanpan Professional Cookware:</B> 1. Before first use, remove all packing materials, labels, and tags, and wash pan in hot, soapy water. Rinse well and dry. 2. Heat pan to working temperature. Medium heat is typically sufficient for frying and sauteing. Since each stove top has its own settings, find the best heat setting for your stove by starting at a lower setting, then gradually increase until water splashed on the pan surface evaporates immediately with a sizzle. High heat can be used for other applications, like boiling water, stir frying, oven roasting etc. Note: Scanpan Professional is oven safe to 500 degrees F. 3. Scanpan Professional can be used without oil, butter, or other seasonings, making it especially suitable for low fat diets. 4. After use, remove food and clean Scanpan cookware with warm, soapy water. Scanpan Professional wipes clean with a sponge. Scanpan Professional is dishwasher safe. Scanpan recommends using extra care if you decide to clean the pans in the dishwasher to prevent damage to plates, glassware, etc. 5. When storing Scanpan cookware and nesting (placing smaller pots inside larger pots) is required due to space limitations, Scanpan recommends placing a paper or cloth towel between the pots and pans to prevent scuff marks."	0

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for 19th-century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. The company even fabricated and erected a series of IBM "tent cities" just outside Binghamton, housing thousands of IBM salesmen during the company's annual stockholders meeting, which had outgrown its previous locale. With the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, renowned explorer Sir Edmund Hillary used Eureka's new and innovative Draw-Tite tent--with its practical, freestanding external frame--in a Himalayan expedition to Nepal (Hillary had climbed to the summit of Mt. Everest only six years earlier). In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants during the first all-American Mt. Everest Expedition, where explorers braved fierce 60-plus mph winds and temperatures reached below -20F. Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s, targeting it to backpackers and families. The first to employ the StormShield design, the lightweight, self-supporting backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents in the industry, with sales reaching over 1 million by its 10-year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as companions on other historic expeditions, including the American Women's Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent years, Eureka designed and donated tents to Eric Simonson and his team. The group took two historic research expeditions to Mt. Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history by finding the remains of George Mallory, but the overall mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found several historical artifacts that are now on display at the Smithsonian. <br> <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all-purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in. If you're a backpacker, alpine climber, or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to use something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall, and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three-season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproof camping. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four-season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types: freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floorplan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one- and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it with less weight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering."	0

Henckels Twin Pro S 6-Inch High Carbon Stainless-Steel Chef's Knife Cooks with small hands find this version of the classic French chef's knife fits. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish Pro S from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Pro S handles are heavier and its knives less weight-forward. The steel used in the Pro S line is identical to that of the Five and Four Star lines. High-tech welding of knives this size and larger combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel.

Henckels International Fine Edge Pro 4-Piece Steak Set The four slender knives in this set convert a thick New York strip, a lamb chop, or a pork roast into bite-size pieces, though their blades are a tad thicker than the best steak-knife blades. With serrated edges on their front halves, these blades tend to tear meat fibers rather than slice precisely through them. Their handles are classic three-rivet style with full tangs. Henckels International Fine Edge Pro is an inexpensive cutlery line made in countries outside Henckels's home of Germany. These knives don't have bolsters and are stamped rather than forged from stainless steel. The steel is of a lesser quality than Henckels's premier lines. These knives are dishwasher-safe and carry a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	0

The SL-4192 is a six-sided wall-mount lantern that includes a hidden motion-sensing device that detects movement in a 180-degree radius up to a distance of 30 feet. You can set the light timer to one, five, or ten minutes, and the sensor itself may be adjusted to give you more or less sensitivity (so it doesn't light up every time a car drives by). The weather-resistant aluminum construction means it's going to look good for a while, too. This model also features "Dual Brite" lighting, which means you can use it for low-level accent lighting in addition to the full-light effect you get with motion-activation. An included timer allows you to set low-light mode for three hours, six hours, or dusk to dawn (an automatic photocell deactivates the unit in daylight). You can also turn the light on and off at will via the manual override that mounts to an existing indoor switch. If you're looking to save a little money on outdoor lighting by installing a motion-detector, this is a great option that won't look out of place.

Should you need more space in the Pet Yard, simply use additional panels (sold separately) to expand the size of your Pet Yard for more room.

With a patented reversible blade for sharp or blunt processing, and two speeds of operation, it is well equipped to handle a variety of jobs. <P>Though it has a high-speed motor and durable stainless-steel motor shaft, keep in mind that the Mini-Mate is designed for small amounts of food: 2 tablespoons is the maximum recommended for one batch, and food pieces should be no larger than 1/2 inch. Purchase it to complement, not replace, a larger, full-function food processor. An instruction book that accompanies the processor details how to process many common foods and troubleshoot problems so you know how to best use and care for your Mini Mate. <P>Cleanup and completion of small jobs is quicker and more efficient because of the small size, though the many parts of the Mini Mate require disassembly, careful cleaning, and reassembly, which does add to total cleaning time.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>"	1

These levels can change rapidly and create harmful conditions when fish waste, uneaten food or other organic matter accumulate, or when untreated water is added. If left uncorrected, all of these can be harmful or even fatal to fish, with consequences such as reduction of oxygen, increase in stress and higher risk of disease. The API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT measures these six parameters with scientific accuracy and provides professional results. It comes with four glass test tubes, a holding tray, test tube rack and computer calibrated, laminated color card. Just fill the test tubes, add the test drops and compare results to the color card.

Overall Depth - Front to Back: -10.5 Inches. Overall Product Weight: -2 Pounds. The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder? In addition to the Host Guide, eight player's books, and the tape, the package contains a map of the crime scene, secret clues, guest invitations, and nametags. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>"	1

These knives are one-piece, hot-drop hammer forged from a single billet of the finest German stainless steel alloy and fitted with the most durable industrial strength, ergonomic handle in the world. Meridian Elit knives are handcrafted and polished one at a time using the same techniques that have been the hallmark of fine Solingen-made cutlery that have stood the test of time. Meridian Elit knives are the authentically superior, forged and triple-riveted knives manufactured in Solingen, Germany.Crafted from 3rd generation craftsmen in the historical cutlery city of Solingen, Germany.The Messermeister Meridian Elit 8" Carving Knife, has a narrow spear-point, fine-edge blade that is used for small to medium carving chores. It separates meat from the bone and slices it into thin serving portions. This knife's narrow, thin blade makes any carving job a breeze. The 8-inch blade, long enough for most slicing tasks, neatly carves slices--thick or thin--from roast beef, ham, and turkey. One of Messermeister's top-of-the-line Elite knives, which are distinguished from the company's first-rate San Moritz knives by a three-step hand sharpening process blades undergo and classic three-rivet, full-tang, seamless polymer handles, the knife is forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel. The blade has a shortened bolster so it's sharp from tip to heel and a cook's forefinger rests comfortably on it. Made in Germany, the knife comes in a padded gift box. To keep the blade sharp, it's best to hand wash this knife in soapy water. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Messermeister Meridian Elite Kullenschliff 10-Inch Carving Knife and Park Plaza 7-Inch Fork" COL feature VAL "Made in solingen, germany 1-piece, fully forged Hand-polished "elite" edge Bolsterless edge Polished spine" COL description VAL "The Messermeister Carving Set consists of an 10-inch Kullenschliff Slicing Knife (E/3688-10K) and a 7-inch Straight Carving Fork (8012-7)."	1

COL title VAL "Zwilling J.A. Henckels Professional&quot;S&quot; 6&quot; Cleaver" COL feature VAL "6-inch heavy-duty cleaver chops through bones and joints, crushes spices High-carbon no-stain steel Ice-hardened, laser-controlled edge Hand washing recommended Lifetime limited warranty" COL description VAL "Classical styling and state-of-the-art technology in blade manufacturing combine to create the Twin Pro S series. Each blade uses the precision SIGMAFORGE construction and is made from the J.A. Henckels exclusive formula high carbon, no-stain steel that is precision-hand honed to stay sharper for longer, and have a more consistent blade angle. The steel is hardened using the patented Friodur ice hardening system for maximum no-stain properties and excellent blade strength because of the improved resistance to corrosion and pitting. The triple riveted Novodur handles lay on the fully visible tang, giving the knife proper balance and greater strength. The most important elements of a meat cleaver are the weight and balance. A large and heavy blade is ideal to help cut and split bones, and chop through joints of uncooked, unprepared meats and poultry. With over 275 years of experience creating some of the finest cutlery available, J.A. Henckels was founded in Solingen, Germany in 1731 and continues to reflect the standards founded years ago in the pieces they create today. The distinguished Henckels brand has one numerous awards throughout its many years of existence, including multiple awards of excellence, recognition for outstanding production processes like the patented Ice-Hardening process, and raving consumer reports. With the recognition of superior craftsmanship and quality, Henckels has expanded from cutlery to produce an assortment of cutlery-related products including scissors and shears, kitchen gadgets and tools, steak knives, wood accessories, cookware and flatware. 6" L This 6-inch professional-grade cleaver is an exceptionally strong, fine tool for chopping through bones and joints in meat. Or, with an eye on versatility, turn it on its side, and crush peppercorns or cloves of garlic. J.A. Henckels has been a knife manufacturer since 1731. The name is synonymous with quality, and this cleaver holds to the company's high standards. It is forged of high-carbon no-stain steel and offers an ice-hardened, laser-controlled edge. While well balanced, it feels heavy, which is a definite benefit in a knife that must hack through tough sinew and bone. Altogether, this is an excellent kitchen tool. <I>--Maria Dolan</I>"	COL title VAL "J.A.

Henckels' International Classic is a moderately priced cutlery line made in countries other than the company's home of Germany. The steel is of lesser quality than that used in its premier lines. Also, the handles are narrower and shallower--a feature those with small hands might appreciate. While this cleaver is dishwasher-safe, hand washing is recommended. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

They feature a single-piece full-tang construction for stability and balance, as well as bolsterless edges for use of their entire blades and ease of sharpening.

By the time company creator Karl Elsener delivered his first pocket knife to the Swiss Army, his cutlery business was already booming. Over the next century, Victorinox cutlery became a top-rated choice among professionals worldwide, with over 300 blades to offer. Victorinox knives have regularly appeared as highly ranked and recommended kitchen tools in <i>Cook&rsquo;s Illustrated</i>, <i>Men&rsquo;s Health</i>, <i>The Cincinnati Enquirer</i>, <i>New York Magazine</i>, and <i>Natural Health</i>, just to name a few. In 2009, the company announced a partnership with professional chef, Daniel Humm, of Eleven Madison Park in New York City. In addition, building on the success of its cutlery business, Victorinox has brought all the same quality and expertise to a wider range of products and accessories, including other kitchen tools, pocket tools, watches, luggage, and clothing. <b>What is a forged blade?</b><br> <div class="leftImage" style="width:350px"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/Victorinox_Forged_Knives.jpg&rdquo; alt="Victorinox Forged Knives"> </div> Forging is the process by which metal is transformed into a knife&rsquo;s shape. A forged knife requires more metal to make it, so it&rsquo;s usually heavier and thicker than a stamped knife and, in many cases, is considered the stronger and superior blade. Forged knives usually have a steel bolster at the beginning of the handle and a tang that runs through the handle&rsquo;s center. All Victorinox forged cutlery is hot-drop forged, which is a high-quality, time-tested method of manufacturing. Steel is super heated and placed under a multi-ton forging hammer, where it is hammered into the shape of the die. The hot metal is placed on the bottom part of the die and the top part of the die drops onto it with great force, causing the metal to spread into the shape of the die. This is only the first of many steps required by expert craftsmen. Additional processing, tempering, grinding, heat treating, polishing, and more, are the reasons why forged knives cost a bit more. Much more effort goes into their creation than in the creation of stamped blades. <b>What knives do I need to own?</b><br> Knife choice or selection is determined by many factors--size, function, style, and preference. The most important factor is function. Different knives have different uses. It is important to use the proper knife for a specific task, since proper knife selection and the use of a proper-sized, sharp knife make for safe cutting. General kitchen tasks and the knife to use for them are as follows: <b>Paring:</b> The most common to own and use, a paring knife is generally for small cutting jobs and peeling of vegetables or fruit. The blade size is usually from three to four inches. Choose the shape and size to fit your hand. Since this is one of the more versatile knives, owning more than one is recommended. <b>Chef's:</b> The most important tool and essential to every cook, a chef&lsquo;s knife is most often used in a rocking method to mince, dice, and chop vegetables and herbs. This one is known as the chef&rsquo;s best friend. <b>Slicer:</b> Most commonly used to slice meats, poultry, and seafood, the slicer is an important companion to any host or hostess. <b>Boning:</b> As its name suggests, a boning knife is used to trim or remove meat and fish from the bone. <b>Bread:</b> Designed with a special edge, a bread knife makes easy work of cutting through crusty bread, pastries, or any item with a crust and a soft interior. <b>Fillet:</b> Most often used by pros and seasoned home chefs, the fillet knife is used to fillet meat and fish. <b>Cleaver:</b> An important addition to any collection, a cleaver is often used to cut or chop through bones. <b>Santoku:</b> This knife combines the features of a cleaver with a chef's knife. The curved blade helps the rocking motion used for chopping, and the wide blade works well for scooping sliced food off a cutting board and for crushing garlic. The santoku can also be used to slice meat and has a narrow spine for making thin cuts. <b>Utility:</b> An all-purpose knife often referred to as a sandwich knife, the utility knife peels and slices fruits and vegetables, and even carves small meats. <b>Shaping:</b> With its curved blade, a shaping knife is great for small precision cuts where control is essential, such as peeling, trimming, or garnishing. <b>What are the different knife edges and what do they do?</b><br> <b>Straight:</b> The vast majority of Victorinox knives come with a straight or fine edge. This means it has a perfect taper along the blade and no serrations. It is designed to cut without tearing or shredding. <b>Serrated:</b> An edge designed with small, jagged teeth along the edge. <b>Scalloped:</b> A blade with waves along the edge generally used to cut breads with a hard crust and soft interior, as well as tougher-skinned fruits and vegetables. <b>Granton:</b> This edge has hollowed-out grooves or dimples on the sides of the blade. These grooves fill with the fat and juices of the product being cut, allowing for thin, even cuts without tearing. Even with the grooves, these are still straight-edge knives and can be honed with a sharpening steel. <b>How should I care for my cutlery?</b> <br> After use, knives should not be allowed to soak in water. The best practice is to hand wash and dry them immediately. This is especially true if they have been used on fruit or salty foods, which may cause some staining, even on stainless steel. Most knives require very little maintenance and it is worth the effort to protect your investment. Though Victorinox knives are dishwasher safe, this is strongly discouraged. The dishwasher&rsquo;s agitation may cause damage. Additionally, harsh detergents can be harmful and cause pitting and spotting on the blades. The handles may also discolor and develop a white film with constant use of the dishwasher. Plus, intense heat associated with dishwashers is not good for the temper of the blade. <b>How do I keep my knives sharp?</b><br> All quality knives require proper maintenance to keep them in perfect cutting shape. The best of edges will quickly dull if it strikes metal, glass, or formica. A wooden cutting board makes the best cutting surface. And, if a slip occurs, a proper cutting board is safer for the user. Frequent use of a Victorinox sharpening steel will keep blades in tip top working condition. All straight-edge knives need steeling to keep their edges. <div class="rightImage" style="width:300px"> <img src=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/How_To_Steel_A_Knife.jpg width="300" height="203" alt="How to steel a knife"></div> <b>How to Steel a Knife</b><br> 1. Hold the steel firmly in your left hand with the guard positioned to stop the blade should it slip.<br> 2. Hold the knife in your right hand and place on top part of steel as shown.<br> 3. Raise back of blade one-eighth inch.<br> 4. Now, moving the blade only, draw it across the steel in an arching curve, pivoted at your wrist. The blade tip should leave the steel about two-thirds of the way down.<br> 5. Repeat the same action with the Blade on the bottom side of the steel. Always maintain the same pressure and angle on both sides of the steel.<br> 6. Repeat five or six times. When a sharpening steel no longer does the job, it&rsquo;s time to take the knife to a qualified knife sharpener who will place a new edge on it. This, along with use of the sharpening steel, will give you many years of sharp, safe blades. Please note that electric knife sharpeners can be harmful. They have to be used carefully as they remove too much metal, can harm the temper of the blade, and most important can change the factory-applied edge angle. <b>How should I store my knives?</b> <br> Safety is the biggest concern of storage, both to the user and to protect the knife's edge. Choices include a knife magnet, knife block, drawer insets, and also individual knife protectors.</div>"	COL title VAL "Vinotemp VT-SHOTCHILLER Liquor Chiller and Dispenser" COL feature VAL "Chills liquor to as low as an ice 5-degree fahrenheit Thermoelectric cooling system for energy-efficient, ultra-quiet operation Contains a 750 ml reservoir and easy-pour faucet NSF certified Molded tray top allows for simple storage of shot glasses" COL description VAL "Get your shot glasses ready for the Vinotemp Shot Chiller liquor shot chiller and dispenser.

The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder?

Monopoly has been popular for most of the 20th century. (How many games have that claim to fame?) Here's a Monopoly set for the next century, packaged in a nifty square metal box with signature character Mr. Monopoly on top. The rules are the same, but all of the game's components have clever new twists to celebrate the millennium. The board is made of silver holographic foil; the money is transparent; the houses and hotels have a new futuristic shape; and the tokens are little icons of turn-of-the-century life: a computer, a cell phone, an in-line skate, a globe, a jet, a sleek car, an all-terrain bicycle, and a dog (this time it's a yellow Lab instead of a Scottie). <I>--Marcie Bovetz</I>"	COL title VAL "Monopoly: Here and Now Edition" COL feature VAL "It's a whole new twist on the classic property trading game! The four railroads are now airports, including LAX, JFK and Chicago's O'Hare Hot property includes Times Square in New York City, Boston's Fenway Park, Las Vegas Blvd. New tokens include the Toyota Prius, New Balance Shoe, McDonald's French Fries, Labradoodle, Motorola RAZR Mobile Headset, and a Laptop Computer The goal still remains the same: buy, sell and trade well-known U.S. properties to win the game! Houston's Johnson Space Center, Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, and Minneapolis' Mall of America!" COL description VAL "Monopoly: Here and Now Edition is a whole new twist on the classic property trading game. The back of the box poses the question, "What would the Monopoly game be like if it were invented today?" One could sum up most of the difference in one word: inflation. If you're used to playing the traditional game, you might feel a little woozy handling Monopoly money denominations that start at $100k and top out at $5 million. Players are no longer vying for control of Atlantic city but now the entire U.S., from sea to shining sea. Entry level properties like Baltic and Mediterranean Avenues, which sold for $60 back in the day, have been replaced by Texas Stadium in Dallas and Cleveland's Jacobs Field, each selling for $600,000. The most disturbing piece of property for sale in this game is the White House--one can only assume it's someone's subtle political humor. Railroads have been replaced by airports like O'Hare and JFK. Utilities have been supplanted by cell phone and Internet service. And, of course, the game pieces have all been updated: laptop, cell phone, hybrid car, commuter coffee mug, jumbo jet, super size fries. Gameplay, however, is still the same. The idea is to buy properties, build houses and hotels, and charge other players rent when they land on your land. Thankfully, transactions are still handled in cash and not by some convoluted electronic banking scheme. There's a lot of changes here that will make cynics and traditionalists sour. That's okay. The original game is still available to them. What's interesting about this edition is that it brings back a kind of jaw-dropping thrill--one that made this game a household word in the middle of the Great Depression, when people dreamt of becoming a millionaires. This game will let you dream of becoming a billionaire. <i>--Porter B. Hall</i>"	1

If your dog does not return he receives a static correction which is startling but not harmful.

These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag: <strong><font color=CC6600>Buy for Cold</font></strong><br> It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10. Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for "warm" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night. <strong><font color=CC6600>Goose or No Goose?</font></strong><br> The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly <i>and</i> stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use. All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget. <strong><font color=CC6600>Bags for All Shapes</font></strong><br> Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips. <strong><font color=CC6600>Pad Yourself</font></strong><br> No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you.

Made of hard maple with edge-grain construction for durability, the cutting board provides two smooth surfaces on either side, slightly rounded edges, and indented hand grips on either end for comfortable, convenient handling. The finely crafted board, which measures 18 by 12 by 1-1/2 inches, works well for a variety of food-prep tasks like chopping meat, slicing and dicing fruits and vegetables, or mincing fresh herbs. Keep the cutting board clean by simply washing it with hot soapy water after each use and dry it with a clean paper towel or let it air dry. The board was shipped from the factory with a penetrating natural oil finish, which allows for great cutting, chopping, and slicing, but it's important to give the cutting board a good oiling on all surfaces every three to four weeks. When the cutting board becomes dry and lighter in color, it's time to re-oil, which is an easy way to lengthen the life of the board by many years. More appealing and attractive than plastic, a wooden cutting board is a great alternative to plastic cutting boards as it can inhibit bacteria growth, while plastic boards harbor bacteria in the grooves cut into their surface. (Although Boos cutting boards do not harbor bacteria, it is a good habit to use separate cutting boards for different types of food prep.) Wood cutting boards are also easier on knives, where plastic boards can dull knives quickly. Boos cutting boards are manufactured by John Boos & Co. in Effingham, Illinois, which has been manufacturing high-quality wood cutting boards, butcher blocks, and countertops since 1887. Every professional or at-home chef knows the importance of a good cutting board. John Boos has developed a full line of professional-quality FDA-approved cutting boards in a variety of styles to accommodate individual needs and preferences. Choose from end-grain or edge-grain construction and from over 39 shapes and sizes. John Boos & Co. is the oldest industry in South Central Illinois, located in Effingham Illinois, and the company has been in business since 1887. Conrad Boos Sr. founded the business in 1887 and named it after his son, John. For many years he worked out of the blacksmith shop in Effingham, and lumber was cut from areas in close proximity. In 1892, the plant moved to its present location at 315 South First Street in Effingham. The blacksmith used a Sycamore tree placed on three legs to straighten horseshoes. The wooden block absorbed the shock of the hammer. In 1890, a local butcher realized the block could be used for cutting meat, and had one made for this purpose. The word spread to surrounding small towns and cities and by 1911, John Boos was shipping from coast to coast. Commercial meat markets were very popular through the 1959, and with the advent of dishwashers and plastic, the commercial market began to feel the impact of a lower-cost alternative, though perhaps not as safe! In 1956, John Boos began to take some of their products to local retail shops and offer the blocks and cutting boards for resale. Merchants would sell these products to consumers for home use. Today, it is common to see John Boos cutting boards in both the commercial kitchen of hotels and restaurants, culinary schools and even cooking shows on television. The old craftsmen work ethic is still around at John Boos & Co. There have been a few changes, though. Sycamore lumber is no longer used--John Boos manufactures premium Hard Rock Maple lumber from surrounding states in the mid-west, most of which comes from the Northern States. And John Boos automation has replaced much of the older equipment. The 1942 block press is one piece of equipment that's still very much in use today, however. John Boos & Co. utilizes 100% of their raw material to benefit the manufacturing processes. The smallest lumber scraps are transformed into sawdust and used as the material of choice to generate electricity and create steam to fuel the boilers. The steam is also used to operate the glue presses and dry kilns. Any saw dust unused by the company is provided to the local agricultural industry. In 1892 the Boos family sold interest in the company to the Gravenhorst family. (There is currently a fifth generation Gravenhorst working for the company. T.S. Gravenhorst, III was named President in 1978 and held that office until retirement in 2002.) In 1895 the building burned and was rebuilt; however, in1899 it was decided that more space was needed, and it was then that they moved to the present site of 315 South First Street. The building was purchased from the old Effingham furniture manufacturing company. In 1920, extra buildings and kiln capacity were added. By the 1940s, butcher blocks were found in every restaurant, food store and butcher shop in America. Then came World War II, which was instrumental in changing the manufacturing philosophy of the management at John Boos and also the course of the business. In 1955, the company expanded by adding a dry kiln, increasing its office space and adding more manufacturing space. The shipping docks were enlarged, warehousing space added and new products added. In addition to the standard old-style butcher blocks, butcher block tops, which are laminated strips of northern hard rock maple or Appalachian red oak, were in great demand, not only in the foodservice industry, but also in the home. The company continued to expand during the late 1960s and early '70s with the growth of its metal fabricated table market. Metal tables had replaced the butcher block as a necessary product in the majority of foodservice/supermarket establishments. Tables with poly or synthetic tops, stainless-steel tops and maple tops were being manufactured. And even though the government was tough on wood products through the 1970s and '80s, the company continued to grow with its new line of BDL store fixtures, park benches and other butcher block furniture items. The wood and metal products are listed with the National Sanitation Foundation, the leader in sanitation agencies for approving equipment to be installed in foodservice and supermarket operations. The products must have approval of various sanitation agencies in order to be accepted by the industry. John Boos & Co. Cucina products, butcher blocks and cutting boards are being used by celebrity chefs throughout the United States. Celebrity chefs currently using John Boos products are Charlie Trotter, Ming Tsai, Paul Kahan, Susan Spicer at Bayona Restaurant in New Orleans, and Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feninger at Border Grill in Santa Monica, California. In addition, the country's premier food channel, "The Food Network" features chefs such as Mario Batali and Emeril Lagasse, who prepare meals every day on John Boos cutting boards. In most cases Boos cutting boards are used on the daily and weekly television programs sponsored for the chefs. In 1994 we were awarded the Gold Medal for Excellence in Foodservice Equipment by the Chefs of America. This ceremony was conducted at Carnegie Hall in New York City, and we were 1 of only 22 companies receiving awards. Hard Rock Maple is the board of choice among professionals because it's friendly to a knife's edge, has anti-bacterial properties, and the larger boards are skid-free, and stay firm while in use. There are also many board designs for different applications and use. John Boos edge-grain-constructed hard maple boards are NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) certified, this regulatory agency governs the commercial markets, as it pertains to particular health and sanitization codes. Still many are unaware of the studies conducted by the NSF, Dr. Dean Cliver, and others, on how the maple boards kill bacteria. Keep your Boos cutting board clean by simply washing it with hot soapy water after each use and dry it with a clean paper towel or let it air dry. If you want to sanitize the board more thoroughly, a diluted mixture of chlorine bleach or vinegar solution consisting of one teaspoon of liquid chlorine bleach in one quart of water or a one to five dilution of vinegar. Do not soak or submerge the board in water, for this will disrupt the moisture content and cause the rails to split. Wood cutting boards are NOT dishwasher-safe. It is extremely important to give your cutting board a good oiling on all surfaces every 3-4 weeks. Your Boos board shipped from the factory with a Boos block cream finish with beeswax, which protects and prolongs the life of your board. We recommend keeping the board oiled with John Boos Mystery Oil and/or Boos Block Cream with Beeswax. The company currently occupies approximately 150,000 square feet of total production capacity in Effingham, IL and approximately 65,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity in Philipsburg, PA and Suring, WI, which produce wooden school furniture. The company has four dry kilns that will dry up to 210,000 board feet of lumber on a continual basis. There are 140 employees in the Effingham facility. Most of the hardwoods used for manufacturing is shipped from Great Lakes states via truck, while our second largest commodity, stainless steel, comes from steel warehouses and distribution centers in Chicago, Indianapolis, and St. Louis. The company currently is cutting up about five million feet of maple and oak each year. A research team led by Dean O. Cliver, Ph.D compared plastic and wooden cutting boards. Their research was first intended to develop means of disinfecting wooden cutting surfaces at home, so that they would be almost as safe as plastics. They found that disease bacteria were not recoverable from wooden surfaces in a short time after they were applied, unless very large numbers were used. New plastic surfaces allowed the bacteria to persist, but were easily cleaned and disinfected. However, wooden boards that had been used and had many knife cuts acted almost the same as new wood, whereas plastic surfaces that were knife-scarred were impossible to clean and disinfect manually, especially when food residues such as chicken fat were present. Scanning electron micrographs revealed highly significant damage to plastic surfaces from knife cuts. Although the bacteria that have disappeared from the wood surfaces are found alive inside the wood for some time after application, they evidently do not multiply, and they gradually die. They can be detected only by splitting or gouging the wood or by forcing water completely through from one surface to the other. If a sharp knife is used to cut into the work surfaces after used plastic or wood has been contaminated with bacteria and cleaned manually, more bacteria are recovered from a used plastic surface than from a used wood surface. The research team has no commercial relationships to any company making cutting boards or other food preparation utensils. They believe, on the basis of their published and to-be-published research, that food can be prepared safely on wooden cutting surfaces and that plastic cutting surfaces present some disadvantages that had been previously overlooked. In conclusion, they believe their research shows evidence that wooden cutting boards are not a hazard to human health, but plastic cutting boards may be."	0

Otherwise Classic knives are identical to other W&uuml;sthof knives, embodying all the virtues that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high- carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. With its long, narrow blade, this 10-inch knife neatly cuts the biggest ham into thin slices. It also can be used for roasts, poultry, and smoked salmon. Alternating hollows on each side of the blade create air pockets, allowing slices to fall away cleanly and permitting thinner slicing. Like all fine knives, it should be hand washed. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

The purpose of mechanical filtration is to trap and accumulate debris and waste material coming from the pond. The purpose of biological filtration is to convert toxic by-products of fish metabolism and other organic waste into much less harmful substances. The purpose of UV-C filtration is to inhibit single-celled algae growth. <div class="centerImage"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PetSafe/LagunaPressureFloDetails._SL500_.jpg" alt="Laguna Pressure-Flo" height="201" width="500"></div> All ponds will benefit from the addition of a filtration system. A good filtration system, such as the Laguna Pressure Flo ensures that the water quality of the pond will remain clear of impurities which can accumulate and create a cloudy or toxic environment for pond plants and fish. The Laguna Pressure Flo will provide your fish with a clean and clear environment to live a healthy life in.</div> <div class="half-col last"> <h4>How Pressure-Flo Filters Work</h4> Pressure-Flo filters are designed to provide three important water filtration operations that are essential for keeping pond water clear and healthy: mechanical and biological filtration, and UVC sterilization. The filters are designed to work in tandem with a solids handling pump. For best results, use a Laguna Max-Flo circulating pump. With the filter connected to the outlet of a pump, water enters the unit through the water inlet. It is then forced to pass through the mechanical filtration stage, consisting of foam filters that intercept and trap dirt and debris. Next, water reaches the biological filtration* chamber where it comes into contact with beneficial bacteria. Finally, dirt-free water passes along the UV-C lamp unit, where it is exposed to ultraviolet rays that inhibit algae growth and green water. Water then returns to the pond through the outlet.<br><br><b>Backwash-Cleaning System</b><br> During operation, coarse debris is captured at the surface of the foam filters. As a result, sooner or later depending on pond conditions, the external surface of the foam filters will clog and hinder proper filtration, because of reduced water flow. The limited water flow through the foam filters reduces the effectiveness of both the biological and UV-C filtration. This condition can easily be detected thanks to the cleaning indicator on top of the filter unit.<br><br><div class="rightImage"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PetSafe/LagunaPressureFloKeepHandsClean._SL300_.jpg" alt="Laguna Pressure-Flo" height="300" width="222"></div> Pressure-Flo filters feature a unique Backwash-Cleaning System that completely cleans the entire surface of the mechanical foam filters without opening the filter or shutting off the pond&rsquo;s pump. The Backwash-Cleaning is performed by two foam filter scrapers, which are operated by using the plungers located on top of the filter unit&rsquo;s lid. While the pond pump is running, simply turn the backwash valve to the backwash position and begin pulling the plungers one at a time up and down until the water being discharged is clean. After cleaning the filter will perform at optimal levels for many days. The Backwash-Cleaning System prolongs the time between filter breakdown maintenance sessions and in most cases only end of season breakdown cleaning will be necessary.<br><br><b>Pond Tip:</b><br><br> When backwashing or performing maintenance, use the backwash water in your garden - it's an excellent natural fertilizer! Unlike other pressurized filters, water travels through mechanical filtration (where large particles are filtered out) before entering the UV chamber, making the UV sterilization process much more efficient.<br><br><b>Cleaning Indicator</b><br> This unit features a cleaning indicator, which lets you know when the filter needs backwashing or cleaning. The red indicator height is approximately proportional to the filter clogging level. When the red indicator is low, the filter is clean, when the red indicator is at the top of its stroke, the filter needs cleaning.<br><br> The cleaning indicator may be affected by many variables, such as waterfall height and pump performance. Its operating characteristics have been calibrated according to specific application conditions. Different application conditions may lead to different results.<br><br><h4>Breakdown of Filters</h4><br><div class="centerImage"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PetSafe/LagunaPressureFloChart._SL750_.jpg" alt="Laguna Pressure-Flo" height="439" width="628"></div></div>"	COL title VAL "Aqueon 13 LED Widescreen Aquarium Kit" COL feature VAL "Unique aquarium design improves the view of fish Significantly larger front glass area compared to a size 10 aquarium Low profile, energy efficient LED hood Dimensions: 25.88" x 10" x 18.25" Kit Includes: Glass Aquarium, Low Profile LED Full Hood, QuietFlow 10 Power Filter, Medium Filter Cartridge, 50W Submersible Heater, Premium Fish Food Sample, Water Conditioner Sample, Fish Net, Thermometer, Set-up Guide" COL description VAL "The LED Widescreen aquariums are taller, wider and sleeker than traditional aquariums, providing an optimized viewing experience.

COL title VAL "Global G-7-7 inch, 18cm Oriental Deba Knife" COL feature VAL "Precisely balanced, with 7-inch blade for fish butchering and hard vegetables Blade made of high-tech molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel Edge retains razor sharpness exceptionally well Stainless-steel handle molded for comfort, dimpled for safe grip Lifetime warranty against defects and breakage" COL description VAL "Slice potatoes for a delicious gratin with this Deba knife from Global. Made from CROMOVA 18 stainless steel, this light knife was created for optimum performance. It was made from a single piece of steel, and has a convex edge for easier slicing. The strength comes from the ice hardening process that reaches a Rockwell degree of C-56-58. It has a wide blade with a thick edge to give you ultimate control. Using this knife feels good on the hands thanks to the hollowed handle and compact design, making it ergonomic for repetitive use. The iconic Global dimple design is on the traditional handle for a nonslip grip. 7" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who like hefty knives, its original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. This knife, however, is relatively heavy. Thick at the back, the broad, 7-inch blade, designed for butchering fish and chopping hard vegetables, carries enough weight to chop through fish bones. For clean, low-friction cutting, the blade is tapered to an edge on only one side so it's even sharper than other Global knives. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Kai Seki Magoroku Kinju ST Japanese Deba Knife 165mm (AK-1102)" COL feature VAL "Material: blade body / molybdenum vanadium stainless steel cutlery, cap / nylon (heat-resistant temperature 90 degrees), handle / laminated wood strengthening Country of origin: Japan Specifications: nylon cap Blade length: 165mm" COL description VAL "Sharp sharpness features.

Check with a Wahl dealer or call 800-PRO-WAHL for information regarding your clipper and blades. <strong>Do I need to oil my blades?</strong><br /> It is strongly recommended that you keep your blades well lubricated at all times, even during storage between usage. Although Wahl blades are protected from corrosion, they will eventually rust if not taken care of properly. It is suggested that you apply a liberal amount of oil occasionally during use and after the job is finished. Take the time to properly clean the dirt and hair from your blade and apply oil to the entire blade to prevent corrosion. <strong>What kind of oil should I use?</strong><br /> Every Wahl Clipper is packaged with a tube or bottle of Wahl blade oil. It is recommended that you use only Wahl oil on your blades. Other aerosol type lubricants can evaporate leaving the metal susceptible to corrosion. <strong>Do I need to buy blade coolant?</strong><br /> The majority of our clippers do not require blade coolant sprays, however some of the high performance, high speed professional units may require the use of coolants for the comfort of the animal."

Incandescent lamp filaments are made of tungsten. Tungsten is a metal that can operate at very high temperatures without evaporating too quickly an resulting in early lamp failure.

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 5-1/2-inch hand-honed blade on this knife features a sharp curve near the bolster and a straight cutting edge. The blade is slim, narrow, and flexible for ease in removing bones, particularly from chicken and other poultry. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell</i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines. Four Star knives were designed and developed in close cooperation with renowned professional chefs. The result was a fully forged knife with a unique molded handle. The Four Star line contains knives for all tasks, and includes the following open stock knife types: parer, bread, peeling, sandwich, utility, carving, chefs, granton edge slicer, santoku, and others. Four Star knives are also available in a range of block sets and gift sets. <td> </tr> </table> <P> <B>A Higher Standard in Knife Construction</B><P> Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of exclusive-formula, high-carbon, no-stain steel under the all-new Sigmaforge standard. As a result, Four Star knives have improved quality consistency, lasting sharpness, and perfect geometry. Sigmaforge one-piece construction also provides high precision and improved stability of the blade and steel structure, thus improving cutting-edge retention for lasting sharpness. In addition, Four Star knives use J.A.

It is often called the "dream stone" for its ability to help one access the non-physical spirit realms. It is a protective stone, and acts as a ward against negative energies. Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy. Jade can be used as a dream-enhancer by slipping a mala of it under your pillow or inside your pillow case while sleeping. Blessed and Energized with proper Mantras, Puja's and Spiritually activated by SWAMI BUDHIRAJA to give best results. Since a Yantra and Mala is a Man-Made object, it requires energization to infuse potency and power to benefit the owner.

This is done by reciting Mantras as prescribed by Vedas (Hindu Holy Books), as well as Homa for the respective Devi/Devta (God/Godess) as per Purpose of Yantra and Mala.

The fan operates at only 6.0 sones. Offering either wall or ceiling installation, its compact polymer housing fits easily between ceiling joists or wall studs. Double-strength steel mounting flanges have keyhole slots for easy installation, and torsion spring grille mounting means that no tools are necessary. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. Broan ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. Today, Broan-NuTone leads the industry with forward-thinking residential ventilation products, customized climate, communications and storage solutions and superior customer service. The Broan brand focuses on range hoods, ventilation fans, heater/fan/light combination units, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) fresh air systems, built-in heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators and trash compactors, while the NuTone brand offers door chimes, central vacuum systems, stereo intercom systems, medicine cabinets, ironing centers, ceiling fans and ventilation fans."	1

They also work well for keeping pasta, rice, flour, sugar, crackers, cookies, and other cupboard or pantry items fresh for longer, securely stored, and neatly organized. Even more, the versatile storage containers can be used to transport lunches to and from work or school--or even for storing smaller kitchen, office, or craft items. Lock&Lock's full line of Classic food-storage containers offers a wide range of shapes and sizes--each with a securely locking lid for airtight storage and peace of mind. Furthermore, the clear body of the containers makes identifying contents easy--no labels required. Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers feature an innovative four-sided locking system for an airtight seal and watertight storage so food stays fresh longer and there's no messy leaks or spills to worry about. The four sides of the locking system promote an airtight seal due to equal pressure to all four sides, along with the hollow-center silicon sealing ring that makes it possible to lock tightly (the silicone sealing ring can be removed for cleaning if necessary). Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, Lock&Lock's Classic food-storage containers not only offer an airtight and watertight seal, but they're also durably built for unbreakable, long-lasting use and hygienic, food-safe storage. The containers can withstand temperatures ranging from -4 degrees F to 210 degrees F, making them suitable for use in the freezer, microwave* (reheating only), and dishwasher (top-rack). The base and lid should NOT be used in the oven, under browning elements, or on the stove top. Another thoughtful design detail includes the fact that the containers can be nested together, and with the lid in place, they can be stacked one on top of the other--particularly useful where space is limited. *Unlock all four latches and loosen lid before use in microwave. Lock&Lock Classic lids feature four side flaps or "wings" that are hinged and slightly flared at the end for an easy grip when opening. More importantly, they come with holes (rectangular-shaped openings) that line up with matching knobs on the base of the containers, making it easy to latch the lid to the base, locking it into place. This patented blocking hole system maintains the integrity of the lid and helps promote an easy, tightly locked container. In addition to its blocking hole system, the Classic food-storage containers feature a blue hollow-center silicon ring in the lid that helps create an airtight, leak-proof seal. Generic silicon with a solid center doesn't compress as well and doesn't have the same restorative power as hollow-center silicon, which means an inferior seal. Lock&Lock's hollow-center silicon seal delivers superior compression and restoration power that helps ensure an airtight seal. When testing the freshness of foods, one of the most important factors is the permeability of the container. In comparison to other brands, the permeability of Lock&Lock products showed to be drastically better. The freshness test is determined throughout the world by how much moisture permeates various containers. Test results show Lock&Lock airtight containers allow in 3,000 - 6,000 times less moisture than other containers, making them far more airtight. Lock&Lock airtight containers passed the leakage test. Their four-sided locking system makes an airtight seal possible due to equal pressure on all four sides and the hollow-center silicone sealing ring. <div class="rightImage" style="width:130px"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/lockandlock/B0054PHG2Q-kemti.jpg" width="130" height="91" alt="Lock&Lock Classic" /> <div class="imageCaption">Passed the KEMTI bending test.</div></div> <h5>Durable Design</h5> Lock&Lock airtight containers have also passed the KEMTI bending test. The container and the wing were fixed to the bending test machine and bent 3,000,000 times 80 degrees left to right. If the container were to be used 10 times a day, it could be used for 821 years (semi-permanently). <div class="leftImage" style="width:145px"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/lockandlock/B0054PHG2Q-healthy.jpg" width="132" height="92" alt="Lock&Lock Classic" /> <div class="imageCaption">Hygienic and food-safe.</div></div> <h5>Healthy Living</h5> Lock&Lock Classic food-storage containers have passed the strict hygiene and safety tests of the U.S. FDA and German SGS. Made of high-quality BPA-free plastic, the durable and heat-resistance containers are food-safe and health-friendly. When not in use, the cleverly designed food-storage containers nest together, both lids and bases, for compact storage in a drawer or on a shelf. The containers also offer a stacking system for maximum space efficiency. The flat lids make it easy to stack one container on top of another--a slight edge helps to keep stacked items in securely place, whether in the freezer, refrigerator, or cupboard. Whether just one or building a collection of several, Lock&Lock's Classic airtight containers offer a smart solution for food storage."	0

These are used to get past six obstacles that guard the princess: a moat, a guard dog, a sentry, a locked door, a dark tunnel, and a magic spell. It's a race against time, because in addition to objects, the board contains spaces that advance the coming of the night and the end of the game. Cooperation comes into play when players help each other come up with creative uses for the various objects. The horse, for example, might be used to swim the moat or run past the dog, or might be traded to the guard as a bribe.

Bosch is so confident that users will get up to 50-percent longer battery life, that it is offering a 2-year battery guarantee with ProVantage. Bluecore Batteries were engineered with internal cooling rods placed between the battery cells to absorb damaging heat. That way, the battery cells stay cooler during operation and charging as compared with standard batteries which heat up quickly, speeding up chemical breakdown and shortening battery life. Bluecore batteries can charge in 30 minutes while other batteries take up to three hours to charge when hot. And best of all, all Bluecore batteries are compatible with current Bosch cordless tools. This particular combo kit comes with the four major tools, plus two of these Bluecore batteries -- and a magnetic bit holder, side handle, 18-tooth carbide blade, two reciprocating saw blades, a double-ended bit, and a carrying bag to keep everything together."

Players help each other climb a mountain, make a community, complete a space exploration... They never play against each other. After all, the initial impulse to play a game is social; that is, we bring out a game because we want to do something together. How ironic then that in most games, we spend all our efforts trying to bankrupt someone, destroy their armies - in other words, to get rid of one another! At <b>Family Pastimes</b> we believe that people of different ages and abilities should be able to play side by side, each making their best contribution. We are all there together when we finish the game to take joy in our successes and wonder how we might work together even better the next time we play.

We hope you enjoy playing and learning together! Players work together to rescue the damsel in distress in the Princess Game. As players move their pieces around the board, they uncover tools such as a boat, key, or magic potion. These are used to get past six obstacles that guard the princess: a moat, a guard dog, a sentry, a locked door, a dark tunnel, and a magic spell. It's a race against time, because in addition to objects, the board contains spaces that advance the coming of the night and the end of the game. Cooperation comes into play when players help each other come up with creative uses for the various objects. The horse, for example, might be used to swim the moat or run past the dog, or might be traded to the guard as a bribe. Since all players are working toward a common goal, everyone wins or loses as a team."

Fast Coupling for 1-1/2-inch diameter hosing</div><div class="half-col last"><h4> Pump Installation General Information</h4> Since the MaxFlo Pump has ability to process water that is moderately loaded with suspended solid particles, the MaxFlo pump is ideal for use with most all filtration systems. The pumps are ideal to transport suspended solids to a Laguna PressureFlo filters which then traps any debris that could potentially pollute pond water, effectively filtering the pond. The pumps are not suitable for supplying water to fountainheads, because the fountainhead jets could easily become clogged by solids processed by the pumps.<br><br>The pump motor sits inside a uniquely-shaped cage that is designed to allow the passage of solids up to a determined size only (from 6 mm to 8 mm depending on the model), as bigger solids may clog and damage the pump.<br><br><b> The pump must never be used without its cage.</b><br><br>For improved operation, place the pump in the deepest part of the pond. At minimum, it must be placed at a depth of 8 inches. If necessary, you can secure the pump to a fixed base by using the keyhole-shaped slots, located at the bottom of the cage, which are shaped to allow the fast engaging/disengaging of the pump from the base.<br><br> The electrical cord must be protected against any objects that may potentially damage it. The electrical receptacle/socket must be located in a dry, protected and easily accessible place.<br><br><h4>Installation</h4> <div class="rightImage"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PetSafe/LagunaMaxFloInstallation._SL350_.jpg" alt="Laguna MaxFlo" height="184" width="350"></div> 1.

It also works to block debris and evenly distribute the water flow before it drips into the Power Filter's biological trickle chamber. The Fluval C4 Bio Screen Replacement Media is exclusively designed for the Fluval C4 Power Filter and will work to keep your aquariums crystal clear. <div class="aplus"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> <h3>Fluval Bio-Screen - 3-Pack</h3> The Fluval C Bio-Screen Replacement Media provides massive biological surface area for friendly bacteria to colonize. It also works to block debris and evenly distribute the water flow before it drips into the Power Filter's biological trickle chamber. The Fluval C Bio Screen Replacement Media is exclusively designed for the Fluval C Power Filter and will work to keep your aquariums crystal clear. Engineered to create superior water quality, the Fluval C Power Filter provides extensive 5-stage filtration for outstanding results. The Power Filter is designed to provide maximum surface area and optimum dwell times in all stages of the filtration process. <b>Stage 1 & 2: Mechanical- Poly/Foam Pad</b> Effective mechanical filtration is essential for efficient chemical and biological filtration. The large surface area of the Poly/Foam pad effectively performs two stages of Mechanical filtration. The first stage of porous foam traps large particles and the second stage of dense polyester captures fine debris. <b>Stage 3: Chemical- Activated Carbon Insert</b> The Fluval Activated Carbon Filter Insert contains 100% premium research grade carbon, which provides large amounts of surface area for adsorption of undesirable impurities. The activated carbon filter insert removes unwanted odors, discoloration and impurities, resulting in a crystal clear aquarium. <b>Stage 4: Biological-Bio-Screen</b> An additional hydraulic circuit conveys part of the intake water to the Bio-Screen placed at the top of the Trickle Chamber cover. Fluvals Bio-Screen removes any debris before dripping into the biological chamber. It also ensures that the water pumped to the Trickle Chamber is evenly spread through all areas before it drips on the C-Nodes, which are contained in the chamber. The motion of water dropping slowly through the grids mimics the rain. <b>Stage 5: Biological- C-Nodes</b> The surface of the C-Nodes is made up of a complex pore system that provides optimal living space for beneficial bacteria to thrive and enhance the removal of ammonia and nitrites. The new Star Shape provides a higher filtration surface and more biological power than a traditional cartridge, resulting in a healthy aquarium environment. Sometimes delicate fish and plants require a more gentle water flow. Fluvals patented re-filtration system allows you to control the flow rate without compromising filtration efficiency. When the flow rate is reduced, up to 50% of the water within the filter chamber is re-processed multiple times. More impurities are filtered out, creating a healthier tank with sparkling clean and clear water 1. Filter Cover 2. Filter Case 3. Leveling Device 4. C-Nodes 5. U Tube 6. Telescopic Intake Tube 7.

For optimal performance it is recommended to clean the impeller cover assembly once a year. The motor should be thoroughly cleaned every three months. Always unplug the Fluval C Power Filter prior to cleaning. Remove cover, filter media and discard water remaining in the filter case. Thoroughly rinse collected debris from the case, impeller cover and impeller assembly using clear lukewarm water. The intake "U" tube and extension tube can be cleaned with a filter stem brush to remove any buildup of deposits. When all parts have been cleaned and thoroughly rinsed, reassemble filter and replace any scheduled media.

Tap water is often devoid of necessary trace elements required by aquatic plants and plants rapidly deplete available micro-nutrients, regular supplementation is necessary. Fluval Quick Clear effectively helps eliminate undesirable particles that cause cloudy aquarium water, such as suspended organic and inorganic particles, dirt, slit and fine sand. Its special formulation clumps together particulate waste by ionic attraction, vastly enhancing filtration absorption and creating crystal clear water. Fluval Bio Clear contains fast-acting enzymes that naturally clarify cloudy aquarium water. Its biological formulation effectively clears cloudy water by rapidly consuming free floating organic food sources, proteins and other organic elements. Bio Clear is recommended for clarifying cloudy water caused by new tank syndrome."	0

All Harrisville products are 100% Made in the USA. Introduce children to the joys of weaving with this sturdy wooden peg loom, made just for beginners. Easy-to-read instructions with big diagrams make learning a snap. Weavers begin by looping heavy cotton string between the loom's slanted nylon pegs, forming the "warp" of their design. Then, using the long, plastic needle and brightly colored yarn provided, they weave the "weft"--the filling that goes over and under the string--creating designs and holding the piece together. In addition to a sense of accomplishment, children get the chance to practice math and fine-motor skills. They can use this 7.5-by-10-inch loom to create wall hangings, doll blankets, coasters, bookmarks, and more. Winner of the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio's Gold Seal Award. <i>--Joan DeClaire</i>"	1

First flown in 1955, the Cessna 172 had more than 43,000 units built as of 2008. Made by Cessna Aircraft Company, this four-seat, single-engine, high-wing aircraft has a great safety record; in fact, it was the safest general aviation aircraft available up to these days. No wonder, the 172 Cessna also became the best-selling and most-flown airframe ever built. From the Manufacturer The four-seat single-engine high-wing Cessna 172 Skyhawk is the most successful mass produced light aircraft in history. It is also possibly the most popular flight trainer in the world. Over 40,000 172s have been built, more than any other Western aircraft. First delivered in 1956, it is still in production as of 2007. The Skyhawk's main competitors include the Beechcraft Musketeer, the Grumman AA-5 series, the Piper Cherokee, and the Diamond DA40. The prototype first flew in November 1955. The 172 was an overnight sales success, with over 1,400 built during its first full year of production in 1965. The 172 began as a relatively simple tricycle landing gear upgrade from the taildragger Cessna 170, with a fairly basic level of standard equipment. Early models looked almost identical to the 170, with the same straight aft fuselage and tall gear legs, although the 172 sported a straight vertical tail while the 170 had a rounded fin and rudder. Later versions incorporated revised landing gear and a lowered rear deck that allowed an aft window, marketed as Omni-Vision. The final aesthetic development in the mid-1960s was the sweptback tail which is still in use today. A variant of the 172, the T-41 is used as a trainer with the United States Air Force and Army. Because of its high-wing design, stability at low airspeeds, and relatively low stall speed, the aircraft is an excellent platform for search and rescue operations and is the primary platform for the Civil Air Patrol's operations. The US Border Patrol also uses a fleet of 172s for aerial surveillance along the Mexican-American border. The Cessna 172 Skyhawk is a four-seat, single engine, high-wing airplane. In the late 1960s, Cessna re-engined its already highly successful 172 four seater with the four cylinder Lycoming O-320. These o-320 powered models were the most successful to bear the 172 model number (and the Skyhawk name for the Deluxe option), as they were in production during GA's golden years, the 1970s. Higher performance 172s include the R172 Hawk XP, Continental lO-360 and the 135kW Lycoming O-360 powered, retractable undercarriage 172RG Cutlass. The 172 was also produced under license by Reims in France as the F172 and FR172 The Cessna 172, considering its longevity and popularity, is the most successful mass produced light aircraft in history. The first production models were delivered in 1956 and they are still in production as of 2007; more than 43,000 have been built. The Cessna 172 started life as a tricycle landing gear upgrade from the taildragger Cessna 170 and the early 172 were similar in appearance to the 170, with the same straight aft fuselage and tall gear legs, although the 172 had a straight vertical tail while the 170 had a rounded fin and rudder. Cessna 172's first flight was on November 1955. It became an overnight sales success and over 1,400 were built in 1956. More Cessna 172s have been built than any other aircraft and probably, Cessna is the most popular flight training aircraft in the world"	0

Made of natural wood material. Add a natural look to your pet's home, while giving him a fun spot to play." COL description VAL "<B>Whats the housing requirement for small animals</B><BR>The cage needs to have a spot for your pet to sleep, a place for his food, water and treat dishes, and some space to play and run around. If your pet is out of its cage during the day to play and exercise, the cage can be smaller to accommodate just a sleeping place, food and water. <BR><BR><B>Why we need a sleeping hut</B><BR>A nestbox or sleeping hut is often appreciated although not always absolutely necessary. Many small animals are nocturnal. That means they like to sleep during the day and run around at night. A hut can help your pet feel more comfortable during the sunlight hours while it is sleeping. <BR><BR><B>What kind of decors should I get</B><BR>Scampering around is a favorite activity for most small animals, especially hamsters and mice. An exercise wheel or a variation of the wheel, a spinning disc, is a great choice for smaller pets. Another variation of the exercise wheel is an exercise ball. Your pet can climb into the ball and roll around the floor or on specially made tracks. Your pet can overexert itself; so don't keep it in the ball for more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time. Some small animals, such as ferrets, sugar gliders and rats like to climb on limbs. Climbing branches, bird perches and bird swings work well. They may get chewed up, but that's part of your pet's play, too! <BR><BR><B>Others caring tips</B><BR>Check it's cage for chewed or damaged areas. Remove any old foods and check the toys to be sure they are still working and in good condition. Keeping your pet safe and well cared for can give both you and your pet a long and happy experience!"

The long-running board game How to Host a Murder is back with new twists, turns and sudden stops! The Last Train from Paris, How to Host a Murder for 8 People takes place in June 1940 aboard a train leaving Paris. German troops are about to enter the city. Roads are a hopeless snarl; the trains are full with little space aboard them. Yet, to remain in the city will not be pleasant. Aboard a government train heading for the safety of southern France, a murder is discovered. The passengers (your guests) must decide who committed the crime. Certainly, the elegant refugees and the dramatic circumstances of their flight from Paris will provide the answer to this mystery. Bring the game to life with costumes, props and theatrical flair for a party everybody will be dying to attend! Agatha Christie mysteries have nothing on this Decipher 9 game of international murder and intrigue. This now-famous role-playing game for adults can turn an average dinner party into dinner theater. Food isn't required, though, and costumes can add to the sense of play. All that is needed is one host and seven guests to become character-murder suspects on a train from Paris on June 13, 1940. The trip has already been completely organized with a host as guide, secret clues, guest invitations, player manuals, a cassette tape with murder details--even name tags and a diagram of the murder scene. Now that's travel planning!

Overall Depth - Front to Back: -10.5 Inches. Overall Product Weight: -2 Pounds. The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder? In addition to the Host Guide, eight player's books, and the tape, the package contains a map of the crime scene, secret clues, guest invitations, and nametags. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>"	1

Reef Trace is nitrate/phosphate free.Replenishment of a number of trace elements is required to maintain an environment ideal for the growth and reproduction of marine life, but while the importance of trace elements has been recognized by aquarists for many years, the physiological reasons are not fully understood. The chemical elements in seawater are varied, and, likewise their addition to the aquarium in trace quantities has varied effects on a variety of saltwater plant and invertebrate species. In general, though, these elements are important for metabolic processes and pigment formation.

The deep drip tray collects the fat so that it doesn't coat your oven, although putting a baking sheet under the roaster is advisable for larger birds. The vertical roaster promotes even cooking, since all sides are exposed to the oven's heat. This configuration also makes the skin exceptionally crispy, a feature which will be lost on those who discard the skin for health reasons The drip tray and rack are both made of stainless steel, which conducts heat quickly and evenly. <i>--Julija Gelazis</i>"	COL title VAL "Norpro Stainless Steel Vertical Roaster, With Infuser" COL feature VAL "Measures 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches The roaster can hold up to an 8 pound chicken and the infuser holds up to 10 ounces Vertical roasting is easy, healthier and more flavorable Made of stainless steel Hand washing recommended" COL description VAL "Infuse your chicken with intriguing flavors using this vertical roaster. It will be the most flavorful and moist chicken you've ever had! Made of quality stainless steel, this roaster begins with a vertical roasting stand that attaches to a large, round drip tray (the stand collapses for easy storage). In the center of the drip tray sits a round dish with cone shaped top. Fill the round dish with herbs, spices, cider, juices or beer; as your chicken rests on the stand, the aromas and flavors from the liquids and herbs pass through the perforations on the cone shaped top, filling the cavity of the bird and adding moisture to the meat as it roasts. Instructions on using the vertical roaster are included. If your last experiment with a vertical roaster led to the bird tipping on its tripod base and landing in the grease pouring out of its cavity, here's a chance to get it right. This Norpro model is versatile enough to serve as a horizontal 13-by-8-1/2-inch rack for roasts. And it easily but sturdily converts to vertical roasting by anchoring up to four hooked pieces to the slats of the flat rack, enabling two birds to roast on this roost, cooking evenly inside and out, with no danger of capon cartwheel. Flipping the bird, so to speak, is a thing of the past--there's no need to pull the rack out of the oven halfway through cooking--and you may as well roast two while you have the heat cranked up (put one in the freezer for next week). Cleanup is fairly easy, too; just be sure to use a nonabrasive sponge or squeegee to preserve the nonstick coating. <i>--Tony Mason</i>"	1

Like most dogs, Dingo had an instinctual need to chew, and to his owner's dismay, Dingo enjoyed gnawing on furniture and destroying shoes. In hopes of fixing Dingo's behavioral problems, Les attempted replacing shoes with rawhide bones. Unfortunately, Dingo was not a fan of these traditional rawhide chews. Rather than giving up hope, Les searched for an alternate solution. Coincidentally, Les's wife worked for a jerky company, and Dingo loved the jerky treats. Due to Dingo's adoration of the jerky, Les began soaking the traditional rawhide bones in water and filling them with jerky, leaving some jerky around the edges for Dingo to see. And with that, the Dingo bone was born. Finally, Dingo had a treat that he loved, while still being able to fulfill his chewing needs. Now your dog can enjoy the original Dingo chew in the form of mini bones. The traditional rawhide bone is a durable, edible bone that serves as a common treat for dogs. With the Dingo Mini Packs, dogs reap the dental benefits of teeth cleansing and gum conditioning, while also enjoying the meaty flavor that the Dingo bone ensures. Because all Dingo bones are hand tied with real meat in the middle, they provide the highest quality treat for your dog. This treat is both easily digestible and soft enough not to damage dogs' teeth, making it a safe and healthy bone that your dog will love. In 1997, the Dingo brand was granted a patent for the single most logical improvement on the rawhide dog chew in thirty years. Due to its meat in the middle quality, the Dingo bone is the only product of its kind on the market. This allows dogs to experience a unique treat that's innovation and uniqueness separates it from traditional rawhide bones. Although competitors have attempted to mimic the Dingo bone, no other product combines rawhide with real meat in the middle to create a longer-lasting treat that encourages your dog to chew through the entire bone.

For our vacuums, one of the tests carried out is a suction test. All refurbished vacuums are electrically tested in compliance with electrical and safety requirements. One of the primary differences between a new Dyson machine and a refurbished Dyson machine is its appearance&#x2013; a scratch here or there or a slightly clouded bin may provide a clue that it has been previously used.

Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary. This 9-1/4-inch square baker, crafted from commercial-grade  stoneware with Le Creuset's poterie glaze, cooks up a mean hot dish and  looks good doing it. Coated inside and out with the company's signature  enamel, the dish doesn't absorb moisture and resists chips, nicks,  stains, and odors. It's oven-safe to 500 degrees F and can also go in  the freezer, refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. It even looks  good at the table. The easy-grip side handles--ridged above and lipped  underneath--provide room enough for oven-mitt-sized fingers. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>"	0

Henckels Twin Pro-S 2-Piece Carving Set" COL feature VAL "Forged from a single piece of Henckels exclusive high carbon, no-stain steel Friodur ice hardened blades for maximum no stain properties and blade strength Unique handle featuring fully exposed horizontal tang between ergonomic polypropylene Hand honed and laser controlled edge for lasting sharpness Super bolster provides weight and adds balance" COL description VAL "J.A.Henckels Twin Pro_S 2-piece set set features a 7-inch Carving Fork and 8-inch Carver knife, and are constructed under Henckels sigmaforge standards which guarantees perfect geometry, as well as better weight and balance. High carbon, no-stain steel bl The thin, long blade of this set's knife makes any fine-slicing job a breeze. The fork's prongs are faceted rather than flat and are exceptionally attractive. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish the Pro S line from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Handles in the Pro S line are heavier and smaller, which makes the knives less weight-forward. The steel used in this line is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines, and the knives are constructed using the same technique. High-tech welding combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, giving the knife its distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Though traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, Henckels claims that the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel. These knives may be placed in the dishwasher, but hand washing is recommended. <I>--Fred Brack</I> <P> <B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/henck-pro-s-block.jpg </td> <td> The J.A.

Mix Orchard Grass Hay with other Oxbow grass hays to create a sweet and nutritious combination. Sizes: 15 oz, 40 oz. Orchard Grass is a green, fruity-smelling grass hay which many small animals enjoy. To the untrained eye, it looks identical to timothy grass, but the seed heads have a different shape. Orchard Grass is a perennial cool season grass with flat leaf blades. The leaves vary in color from green to bluish-green depending on the maturity of the plant. The lower surface of the leaf is not shiny; and leaf sheaths can be somewhat rougher to the touch than timothy. Orchard Grass is recommended by veterinarians for small herbivores due to the nutritional content. Orchard Grass can be mixed with other grass hays when feeding your pet. This is encouraged because animals seem to like the variety. Mixing your grasses will encourage them to eat more hay, which is beneficial to the health of the animal. Hay is absolutely vital to the health of small herbivores. Orchard Grass also provides a long-strand fiber source that is needed to improve the digestive and intestinal functions by stimulating the digestive system. When animals are fed free-choice hay, it promotes their natural chewing behavior, which helps prevent molar spurs and other dental problems that are so common in these small herbivores. 100% Orchard Grass Preservative and Additive Free. Loose hay contains stems, leaves, and limited seed heads."	1

Then travel from state to state on the campaign trail answering questions on US history and geography to win electoral votes. Winner is the first person to make it to Washington, D.C. first with enough electoral votes.  Learn how the election process works as well as fascinating historical and geographical facts.Ages 10 and Up - 2 to 4 Players The board game Hail to the Chief can take the humdrum out of learning all about our nation's presidents, the election process, U.S. history, and geography. The object is to be the first "candidate" to land on the Presidential Seal. The game, designed for children and adults to play together, is divided into two parts: the Convention and the Campaign. During the Convention, you, the delegate, must accumulate enough correct answers about presidents and the presidency to advance to the Campaign portion, where you'll have to answer questions about U.S. history and geography. The beauty of this game is that the questions are grouped into four difficulty ratings--easy child, hard child, easy adult, hard adult--so players of all knowledge levels can play together. Some of the easy questions are really easy ("Name the national anthem of the U.S."), while others seem a bit obscure ("Did Dakota Territory troops fight in the Civil War?"). The game also tests your honor, since the answers to many questions appear visually on the board itself ("What are the states that border Lake Michigan?").

Includes a built-in cooling fan and water bottle holder.  Fluid natural motion provided by a whisper quiet drive system. The combination of a heavy 30 lb. flywheel and a high gear ratio not found on comparable models means an extremely smooth feel with plenty of resistance at the top end for a machine that will provide a challenging workout.  Upper body exercise provides a total body workout.  Stationary handle bars with built-in pulse sensors for monitoring your heart rate. A heart rate chest strap is also included for hands free pulse monitoring and heart rate interactive programs.  Oversize foot pedals for a comfortable workout. These unique foot pedals were designed in collaboration with a leading physical therapist and sports enthusiast. Sole engineers have designed in a 2 degree inward slope to the foot pedals which reduce ankle and knee stress that is common in other elliptical machines.  The four real wheels which ride on heavy duty rails provide a smoother more stable feel and reduce side to side foot pedal motion. A feature found only on more expensive models Enjoy an efficient full-body workout without heading to the gym with the Sole E35 elliptical trainer. Boasting a heavy 25-pound flywheel, a high gear ratio not found on most comparable models, and a pair of upper body handles, the E35 delivers an extremely smooth workout with plenty of top-end resistance. Users will also appreciate the unique oversize foot pedals, which were designed in collaboration with a leading physical therapist and sports enthusiast. The pedals are not only extra large, but also feature a 2-degree inward slope that reduces the ankle and knee stress that's common in other elliptical machines. And thanks to the stationary handle bars with built-in pulse sensors, it's a breeze to monitor your heart rate as you exercise (a chest strap is also included for highly accurate wireless monitoring). Workout specifics include 16 resistance levels, ten total programs (including one custom program), and a 20-inch stride length. Perhaps the handiest feature from a user perspective, however, is the easy-to-use electronic console, which integrates a blue backlit LCD display, a cooling fan, and a water bottle holder.

The company's treadmill line is simple in design, with an emphasis on quality and warranty all at a great price. Sole's easy-to-use treadmills offer a great value and feature a convenient, space-saving portable design. The treadmills have a very stable base with four wheels for ease of movement, folding decks to conserve space, and a 30-year motor and lifetime deck and frame warranty. Sole is always looking for ways to make their equipment better, more efficient, with higher quality at a great price. <strong>About Elliptical Trainers</strong><br> Elliptical trainers represent the next wave of advancement in low-impact cardiovascular exercise machines and continue to grow in popularity. By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

The lead can change hands from play to play and strategy is everything. Play is simple. Players are represented by either Black or White discs on the board. On each turn, players flank the discs of the opposing player between two of their own. Once captured, the double-sided discs are turned over and become the opposite color. If you have a move, you have to take it whether you want to or not. Thats all, thats the entire game. But more and more discs fall to the opposing side with each turn. Where will it all end? Starting from just four discs to begin the game, play moves all over the board with as many as 64 discs placed by the final move. Play can end when one player cant make any more moves OR when the board is full. To add to the fun, if you can make a move but youre out of discs, your opponent has to give you one of theirs. Thats like arming the enemy! As you become more and more familiar with Othello, certain strategies will begin to emerge. Owning a corner is always an advantage as that protects your discs in the immediate vicinity - your opponent cant outflank you. But is your opponent backing you towards a corner so they can try to control it themselves? Thats the strategy of Othello. Can you see enough moves ahead to make your opponent put a disc somewhere they dont want to? A minute to learna lifetime to master!""	0

Like most dogs, Dingo had an instinctual need to chew, and to his owner's dismay, Dingo enjoyed gnawing on furniture and destroying shoes. In hopes of fixing Dingo's behavioral problems, Les attempted replacing shoes with rawhide bones. Unfortunately, Dingo was not a fan of these traditional rawhide chews. Rather than giving up hope, Les searched for an alternate solution. Coincidentally, Les's wife worked for a jerky company, and Dingo loved the jerky treats. Due to Dingo's adoration of the jerky, Les began soaking the traditional rawhide bones in water and filling them with jerky, leaving some jerky around the edges for Dingo to see. And with that, the Dingo bone was born. Finally, Dingo had a treat that he loved, while still being able to fulfill his chewing needs. Now your dog can enjoy the original Dingo chew in the form of mini bones. The traditional rawhide bone is a durable, edible bone that serves as a common treat for dogs. With the Dingo Mini Packs, dogs reap the dental benefits of teeth cleansing and gum conditioning, while also enjoying the meaty flavor that the Dingo bone ensures. Because all Dingo bones are hand tied with real meat in the middle, they provide the highest quality treat for your dog. This treat is both easily digestible and soft enough not to damage dogs' teeth, making it a safe and healthy bone that your dog will love. In 1997, the Dingo brand was granted a patent for the single most logical improvement on the rawhide dog chew in thirty years. Due to its meat in the middle quality, the Dingo bone is the only product of its kind on the market. This allows dogs to experience a unique treat that's innovation and uniqueness separates it from traditional rawhide bones. Although competitors have attempted to mimic the Dingo bone, no other product combines rawhide with real meat in the middle to create a longer-lasting treat that encourages your dog to chew through the entire bone. Dingo comes in different shapes, flavors and functional forms:"	0

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 10-inch specialty blade on this knife--sometimes called a Granton or Kullenschliff --features a ""hollow-ground"" edge specially designed for fine cutting duties. Air pockets develop in the hollows along the blade's edge, keeping even the thinnest-sliced meats from clinging to the blade. In addition to its superb meat-slicing abilities, this specialty knife is also great for slicing layer cakes and biscuit bases. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell</i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines. Four Star knives were designed and developed in close cooperation with renowned professional chefs. The result was a fully forged knife with a unique molded handle. The Four Star line contains knives for all tasks, and includes the following open stock knife types: parer, bread, peeling, sandwich, utility, carving, chefs, granton edge slicer, santoku, and others. Four Star knives are also available in a range of block sets and gift sets. <td> </tr> </table> <P> <B>A Higher Standard in Knife Construction</B><P> Four Star knives are precision forged from a single piece of exclusive-formula, high-carbon, no-stain steel under the all-new Sigmaforge standard.

Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 5-inch blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a wide point. The serrated edge is perfect for cutting and slicing soft products that have a firm skin, as this type of blade penetrates more easily than one with a smooth edge. This medium-size knife makes a handy and versatile kitchen tool for cooks of any ilk. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell</i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines.

Adams: A 2nd-Generation, Family-Owned Company</h4> Kitchen storage solutions by J.K. Adams make it easy to save on valuable kitchen space while enjoying the best of USA-made craftsmanship. The family-owned company provides everything from pot hooks and spice bottles to wooden spice carousels, kitchen-knife blocks, bread boxes, wine racks, pot racks, and more. J.K. Adams' wooden kitchen items feature renewable and sustainable wood in Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, or Hickory varieties. A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving "carousel" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K. Adams has continued to lead and inspire the kitchen storage market with their innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and exemplary craftsmanship. Some of the world's finest woodworkers can be found in New England. The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K. Adams' success is certainly attributable to the early Vermonters employed by the company while in its infancy who brought forth the techniques and quality craftsmanship that could only come from generations of shared knowledge and experience. The J.K. Adams factory has been at the same location since the beginning. As many as three generations of families have relied on J.K. Adams to provide for their families. Located in a rural area of Vermont, J.K. Adams remains one of the largest employers in the area and is an important pillar of support for the local community. J.K. Adams has always used the creativity and skill of their workforce in developing new products, and today J.K. Adams continues its New England craftsmanship with a wide variety of cutting boards, as well as wooden salad bowls, kitchen islands, and slate serving trays. And at the J.K. Adams factory, you'll find future generations of woodworkers building upon the traditions begun over 65 years ago. Cutting boards and other products by J.K Adams are made in the North America. In colonial New England, three strokes of a broad ax were used to mark the finest trees in the forest for the Queens' Navy shipmasts. The broad arrow was adopted as our logo because it symbolizes the exceptional quality of wood that goes into our products. Wood is naturally anti-bacterial, and any bacteria left on the board will actually lessen in time versus multiplying on a plastic cutting board. A wooden board will also be more gentle on your knife's edge, and it just feels and sounds better under a knife. Wash by hand in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly, and oil frequently with mineral oil to help give it an optimal appearance. Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen. For storage, keep the board away from strong sunlight as avoiding UV rays will reduce the risk of fading."	1

Finally we must return safely to base camp with what we gathered. There are dangers and obstacles to avoid, such as The Creeping Claw and The Nasty Hairy Thing! We may have to resort to whatever desperate remedy we find in our knapsacks to save us: maybe a Super Head Net, or a Smelly Sock!

At <b>Family Pastimes</b> we believe that people of different ages and abilities should be able to play side by side, each making their best contribution. We are all there together when we finish the game to take joy in our successes and wonder how we might work together even better the next time we play.

You are part of a  team of archaeologists searching through temples and caves to recover valuable treasures  and artifacts.

Players turn over two cards at a time. If a clock is drawn, time is running out and thieves might get away with the three hidden treasures! Children will have fun testing their memories, cooperating with their teammates, and honing their detection skills with this game.

(37 gram unit) Pepper Spray" COL feature VAL "Highly Targetable - because it's a foam and not a spray or fog, it's easy to hit your target accurately indoors Not Overly Sticky - Many pepper gels on the market are advertised to stick like glue, that it's difficult to clean away the crusty Safe - Inferno's unique formulation will not blister the skin or burn the corneas of the eyes.. In contrast Inferno High Quality - Unlike other brands, Inferno uses the absolute best HFC134A aerosol propellant This item is not for sale in certain states" COL description VAL "Inferno is a new pepper canister weapon from Cold Steel that will turn the biggest, meanest, most violent criminal into helpless molten wax at your feet. Unlike other pepper sprays you may have heard about, Inferno deploys a highly targetable foam that contains 8% Oleoresin Capsicum and 2% black pepper. It dissolves into a liquid on contact (this liquefaction effect is tactically important, since other sprays remain "foamy" -like a pie in the face-and make it possible for your assailant to wipe the foam from his face and chuck it at you). One good shot in the face with Inferno will dilate the capillaries of the eyes causing temporary blindness. It will induce choking, coughing and nausea and most importantly trigger and immediate and massive sneeze reflex (due to the atomized black pepper particles) that will drag the super hot Habanero chili extract deep into the mucous membranes of the sinus cavities of the nose, throat and lungs causing them to swell up and prevent all but desperate life support breathing. In short Inferno will melt any attacker(s) into the ground and leave them totally incapacitated for a considerable period of time giving you ample opportunity to escape and summon the police.DescriptionInferno 1.3 oz.

These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag: <strong><font color=CC6600>Buy for Cold</font></strong><br> It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10. Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for "warm" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night. <strong><font color=CC6600>Goose or No Goose?</font></strong><br> The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly <i>and</i> stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use. All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget. <strong><font color=CC6600>Bags for All Shapes</font></strong><br> Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips. <strong><font color=CC6600>Pad Yourself</font></strong><br> No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you.

His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a "no light, no pay" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come."	1

We got started in apiculture and learned how to raise our own beehives by attending classes organized through our local beekeeping association. With each passing season, though, we noticed there were fewer and fewer wild bees around and more and more beehives collapsing without any obvious cause. After suffering the loss of our own hives, we decided it was time to take action and help save the bees. That's why we established Humble Bee and agreed on a mission - to give back 10% of our profits to charities that encourage local beekeeping activities and promote bee conservation efforts. We want to get more people involved with beekeeping and help newcomers establish their own apiaries. Our beekeeping products are built to the highest safety and quality standards. In fact, we only sell products that we've tested and use at our own apiaries! We promise that you'll love your new Humble Bee gear as much as we do, or we'll give you a full refund - no questions asked. And, to top things off, we guarantee the caliber of all our products with a hassle-free 2-year warranty."	0

Any vestige of personality has long ago been eradicated from their genetic makeup, and now they move, breathe and live as one being, an arm of the Emperor, wielded with crushing force. Though they have specific equipment and training for various environments, these differences are slight and, in a disconcerting way, only emphasize their inhuman conformity. They cannot be bribed, blackmailed or bullied into stepping out from behind their armor and anonymity, for there is nothing left inside to reveal, not even a fragment of humanity."	0

Leave 2 or 3 inches on the collar for extra adjustment and cut off and dispose of the extra length. Consult a veterinarian before using this product on debilitated, aged or medicated pets. Sensitivity may occur after using any pesticide product for pets. Some animals may become irritated by the collar if it is applied too tightly. If this occurs, loosen the collar. If irritation continues, remove the collar and bathe your dog with mild soap and rinse with large amount of water. If signs continue, consult a veterinarian immediately. Do not use this product on dogs simultaneously or within 30 days before or after treatment of other flea and tick products. However, flea and tick collars may be replaced immediately."

The rebounder is an excellent training device for all skill levels. <b>About STX</b><br> STX is the world's leading manufacturer of men's and women's lacrosse sticks and protective gear, including gloves, padding, and women's eyegear. No matter what the product, STX is driven by the same philosophy that spurs every innovation: to create the highest-quality, most-cutting-edge lacrosse equipment available and enable players to reach peak performance on the playing field. This, in turn, raises the standard of play and the specter of America's oldest game and fastest-growing team sport. STX's history traces back to the early 1960s, when the STX founders--lacrosse players themselves--began experimenting with synthetic materials to create a lighter and more resilient stick. Traditional wooden lacrosse sticks were difficult to manufacture, poorly balanced, and hard to maneuver, and often broke due to the physical demands of the game. STX's earliest sticks, by contrast, had a solid double-walled head made of Dupont Adiprene urethane rubber affixed to a hickory shaft. Although crude by today's standards, STX's first synthetic stick went a long way in solving the biggest problems facing the sport. Each stick was now the same weight, balance, and flexibility, because they were made from the same material and same mold every time. In the years since, STX has pioneered nearly every equipment innovation in the game, including such head advancements as the straight double-wall head, the mesh pocket, the pinched sidewall head, and the forward canted head; such gear improvements as the aluminum handle, the composite handle, and the offset handle; and a host of glove and goggle enhancements.

Henckels Twin Pro-S 2-Piece Carving Set" COL feature VAL "Forged from a single piece of Henckels exclusive high carbon, no-stain steel Friodur ice hardened blades for maximum no stain properties and blade strength Unique handle featuring fully exposed horizontal tang between ergonomic polypropylene Hand honed and laser controlled edge for lasting sharpness Super bolster provides weight and adds balance" COL description VAL "J.A.Henckels Twin Pro_S 2-piece set set features a 7-inch Carving Fork and 8-inch Carver knife, and are constructed under Henckels sigmaforge standards which guarantees perfect geometry, as well as better weight and balance. High carbon, no-stain steel bl The thin, long blade of this set's knife makes any fine-slicing job a breeze. The fork's prongs are faceted rather than flat and are exceptionally attractive. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish the Pro S line from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Handles in the Pro S line are heavier and smaller, which makes the knives less weight-forward. The steel used in this line is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines, and the knives are constructed using the same technique. High-tech welding combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, giving the knife its distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Though traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, Henckels claims that the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel. These knives may be placed in the dishwasher, but hand washing is recommended. <I>--Fred Brack</I> <P> <B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/henck-pro-s-block.jpg </td> <td> The J.A.

He tracks through the snow in a quaint village in Europe and gently peaks in the door. Father Christmas discovers a spruce tree beautifully lit with white lights and shiny ornaments hung everywhere. Ohwhat a sight to see! As he sneaks in and quietly delivers his goodies he spies a comfy chair next to the glowing, warm fireplace. He takes a few minutes to sit and ponder the beautiful things before him. Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Pere Noel or Santa Claus are some of the more common names used to describe a white-bearded, red-cloaked man who delivers presents and cheer. He is a universal figure who appears in many cultures and countries from ancient times. Father Christmas first appears as a jolly old man as a reaction against the Puritans resistance to celebrate Christmas. The 17th century English writer, Ben Johnson, gave 'Sir Christmas' his appearance but it was an American poet who provided Sir Christmas with his long fur-trimmed coat, flowing beard and the sleigh pulled by reindeers. This early 19th century American poet, Clement Clarke Moore, established the modern image of Father Christmas in his poem A Visit from St Nicholas more popularly known as The Night Before Christmas."	0

Using a sharpening steel each time you use your knives will keep the edge aligned, resulting in a sharper, safer knife. A classic tool that helps get the best from knives, this sharpening steel is a solidly crafted addition to any knife block. Between professional sharpenings, tiny metal fibers bend down on a blade, dulling the surface. The purpose of the sharpening steel is to straighten up those fibers, maintaining the sharpest edge possible for daily use. This model is lightweight, with a flared handle and a tapered edge. It's extremely comfortable and well balanced for experienced users, but beginners may have an easier time with a more substantial weight.

This sharpener works well for both right- and left-handed people, features rubber feet so it won't skid on the countertop, and measures approximately 8 inches across and 3 inches tall, so you can store it in a drawer or display it in a small space. To use, place the knife sharpener on a flat surface, pressing down slightly with one hand. Draw the knife blade with a little pressure towards yourself, repeating up to five times for the dullest blades. For very blunt knives, use the first module and then the second. Knives with a bit of bluntness may require only the first module to bring back the original sharpness. Check the results by cutting into a sheet of paper."	1

Henckels Twin Pro-S 2-Piece Carving Set" COL feature VAL "Forged from a single piece of Henckels exclusive high carbon, no-stain steel Friodur ice hardened blades for maximum no stain properties and blade strength Unique handle featuring fully exposed horizontal tang between ergonomic polypropylene Hand honed and laser controlled edge for lasting sharpness Super bolster provides weight and adds balance" COL description VAL "J.A.Henckels Twin Pro_S 2-piece set set features a 7-inch Carving Fork and 8-inch Carver knife, and are constructed under Henckels sigmaforge standards which guarantees perfect geometry, as well as better weight and balance. High carbon, no-stain steel bl The thin, long blade of this set's knife makes any fine-slicing job a breeze. The fork's prongs are faceted rather than flat and are exceptionally attractive. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish the Pro S line from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Handles in the Pro S line are heavier and smaller, which makes the knives less weight-forward. The steel used in this line is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines, and the knives are constructed using the same technique. High-tech welding combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, giving the knife its distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Though traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, Henckels claims that the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel. These knives may be placed in the dishwasher, but hand washing is recommended. <I>--Fred Brack</I> <P> <B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/henck-pro-s-block.jpg </td> <td> The J.A.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

Players get more power out of every word and create more play possibilities. Players can build from words crossword puzzle-style or by stacking letters on top of tiles already on the board. The challenge is to make new words each time. For example, "stack" becomes "snack," then "snapshot." If it sounds like 3-D Scrabble, there's more to know. Scoring is simpler: each tile earns two points, and each stacked tile earns one. The usual <i>No</i>s apply: no capitalized, hyphenated, or abbreviated words, etc. The set comes with 100 letter tiles, tile racks for two to four players, and a plastic game board. <i>--Lynne Sampson</i>"	COL title VAL "Hasbro Deluxe Turntable Scrabble" COL feature VAL "Scrabble Brand Crossword Game: Deluxe Edition This deluxe version of the one and only all-American crossword game has a rotating board so you can analyze all the angles!

Includes gameboard, 100 wood letters, 4 plastic tile racks, drawstring cloth bag, score pad and sand timer. 2-4 players. Ages 8 and up. It's still hard to get a triple word score, the tiles are still made of wood, there's only one "X" in the whole box, and family feuds are increasing exponentially. But after 50 years, Scrabble has had a face-lift: a swivel base allows the board to turn so players don't have to work upside down, a plastic grid helps keep tiles in line, and a handy bag stores the letters when they're not in use. The premise hasn't changed at all--two to four players battle it out to make high-scoring words from seven little letters--so choose a dictionary before play begins to avoid ugly confrontations. <i>--Lynne Sampson</i>"	1

The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high- carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'.

With its long, narrow blade, this 10-inch knife neatly cuts the biggest ham into thin slices. It also can be used for roasts, poultry, and smoked salmon.

COL title VAL "Bachmann Industries Alco S4 DCC Sound Value Equipped HO Scale #816 Milwaukee Road Locomotive" COL feature VAL "DCC Sound Value Equipped Locomotive Locomotive backed by Bachmann's exclusive Limited Lifetime Warrantee Preforms best on 18" radius curves or greater HO Scale  1:87 - Conforms with NMRA (National Model Railroad Association) Standards Operating Headlight Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended."

COL title VAL "Bachmann Industries F7-A DCC Sound Value Equipped HO Scale Diesel New York Central Lightning Stripe Locomotive" COL feature VAL "DCC Sound Value Equipped Locomotive Locomotive backed by Bachmann's exclusive Limited Lifetime Warrantee Preforms best on 18" radius curves or greater HO Scale  1:87 - Conforms with NMRA (National Model Railroad Association) Standards Operating Headlight Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled &#039;IN.&#039; Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended."

Brothers of Bushcraft Knife w/Black Handle" COL feature VAL "Overall Length: 10" Blade Length: 4 1/2" Blade Material: 1095 High Carbon RC 56-58 Black Canvas Micarta Handle Sheath: Black Kydex" COL description VAL "The Fieldcraft Knife was designed by The Brothers of Bushcraft, a coalition of men across North America focusing on sharing wilderness living skills of all categories. From tracking, to building shelters, the Brothers of Bushcraft make it a point to show the skills to all people, of all ages, from all over. The Fieldcraft Knife is the culmination of their knowledge, combining experiences from; the broad and humid rain forests, the arid and scorpion-littered deserts, and the frigid northern lands that span the Americas. The handle is one of the most ergonomic ones on the market, sporting several useful additions. Although knives with a lot of frills often end up lacking, the additional items found on the Fieldcraft knife were selected from experience and critiqued in every step of design, development and production. Being made of canvas micarta, the handle will never let you down. The bow drill divot on the handle is frictionless and makes starting those primitive fires almost effortless. The &quot;Thumb Scallops&quot;, formed on the hilt of the handle offer more comfort and control when using specialized carving and skinning grips. The pommel of the blade is simply the tang of the knife exposed enough to allow impact from a baton to not effect the handle (though the micarta is definitely tough enough to take such abuse). On the exposed pommel, you will find a scraper specially designed by one of The Brothers of Bushcraft, for striking Ferro rods in a safe and efficient manner. The Fieldcraft knife has had heavy duty abuse, and testing done in the wilderness of Canada, where local survival experts Mors Kochanski, Dr. Gino Ferri, and many others have deemed her a &quot;Serviceable Field Knife&quot;. These words are exactly what she is meant to be. The TOPS Knives/Brothers of Bushcraft Fieldcraft Knife will do just about any chore that you can throw at her in a wilderness survival scenario."

This means the machine moves in the same natural motion as your body does, providing a true running feel. Inferior designs can have either too much vertical movement or too much horizontal movement; those units will often make the user feel off-balanced while exercising. The E1, however, will keep you in a balanced upright position for a stable and secure feel. The E1 also has a balanced steel frame which eliminates rocking while maintaining a compact footprint, which makes it ideal for your home workout area (particularly when space is a concern). Combined with its durable components, the steel frame supports users up to 275 pounds while the unit's front transport wheels make it easy to move around. Proper pedal spacing on this elliptical eliminates hip fatigue--when your feet are forced out too wide or in too narrow, your body will incur undue strain on your hips. The E1 also offers a comfortable step-up height to allow you to start your workouts safely while its moving arms recruit your upper body and core to the workout, making this a total body trainer. <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="200"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/best-fit-2-full.jpg" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The E1 offers a compact footprint that's ideal for smaller spaces.</strong></em></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> To track your workout metrics, the E1 offers contact heart rate handles for advanced monitoring.

COL title VAL "Global G-38-10 inch, 26cm Diamond Sharpening Steel" COL feature VAL "Solid-core rod hones as well as realigns knife edges Made of chrome/vanadium stainless-steel coated with diamond particles Plated with hard chrome for additional resistance to abrasion 3/4-inch oval exposes more surface for quicker work Stainless-steel handle molded for comfort, dimpled for safe grip" COL description VAL "<ul><li>Dimensions: 4.5 IN x 20.2 IN x 14.2 IN</ul> Although steels often are touted as sharpening tools, few actually sharpen knife blades, but they do perform the vital task of realigning, or resetting, edges, which bend when contacting a cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool's chrome/vanadium stainless-steel rod contains hundreds of thousands of diamond particles, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. Using this steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles. However, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings better than a steel without diamonds because it accomplishes the final task of a professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine point. Exceptionally well made, this tool's rod has a solid core and has been plated with hard chrome for additional resistance to abrasion and to extend its life. Because the rod is a 3/4-inch-wide oval, it exposes more surface and works quicker than a cylindrical rod. Like Global's signature knife handles, the steel's handle is molded for comfort and dimpled for a safe grip. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it, and this steel's 10-inch rod is long enough for most household knives. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL title VAL "Global G 45 Ceramic Sharpener" COL feature VAL "Maintain the razor-sharp edges of your knives between sharpenings with this easy-to-use ceramic honing rod Lightweight design features ergonomic handle with Globals signature dimple pattern, which provides a stronger grip Oversized hand guard helps ensure your safety 10" length accommodates a wide variety of cutlery, large or small Not for use with serrated or hollow-edged knives" COL description VAL "Also called a Honing Steel. The Global G 45 Ceramic Sharpener is used to hone the blade of kitchen knives. It will maintain a sharp edge with daily use. Despite the name, sharpening steels don't actually sharpen  knives--unless they're diamond steels. Instead, they perform the vital  task of realigning, or resetting, edges, which bend when contacting a  cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool is made of  harder-than-steel ceramic it performs better and quicker than most  steels. Using the sharpener often--before each time a knife is employed  is ideal--prevents a blade from becoming dull and prolongs intervals  between professional sharpenings, or the need of a whetstone or other  true sharpening device. Like Global's signature knife handles, the  ceramic sharpener's handle is molded for comfort and dimpled for a safe  grip. The rule is that a realigning tool should be at least as long as  the knife blade being drawn across it, and this sharpener's 9-1/2-inch  rod is long enough for most household knives. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

Today, Messermeister operates as a U.S. company that strives to provide thehighest quality of cutlery and culinary tools to both food-service professionals and home cooks.We are committed to designing new and innovative products and sourcing the world to find the very best quality at the right price for the market. The Park Plaza collection of stamped knives is manufactured using the finest stamped high carbon German krupp stainless steel, featuring a sharp edge and hard blade, allowing it to hold its edge for a long time. The Park Plaza collection features a triple riveted polyoxymethylene POM handle, permamently securing the handle to the full tang and providing a classic design. The riveted handle is made with impact resistant and state-of-the-art materials to withstand rigorous use. Stamped knives are noticeably lighter than forged knives, which is an attribute for those who are not comfortable with heavy knives. This Park Plaza 2-piece carving set includes an 8-inch carving knife and a 7-inch forged carving fork. The carving knife has a narrow spear pointed 7-1/2-inch fine edge blade and is used to separated meat from the bone and slice it into thin portions. The 7-inch forged carving fork features extra long prongs. Messermeister offers a guaranteed lifetime warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. Every knife comes with free lifetime sharpening and reconditioning. Once the edge is no longer sharp, have an expert sharpener re-grind a new edge on your knife or with a return shipping fee, Messermeister will re-sharpen your knife free of charge. Contact customer service at toll free800-426-5134. When carving a roast or turkey, a good knife is only half the battle. You've also got to hold the meat steady or you may slice more than the meat. For those who don't need a foot-long slicing knife to cut their small turkey or roast, this 8-inch carving knife is a nice alternative, and the 7-inch carving fork with extra-long tines will hold it still while you slice. This Messermeister Park Plaza carving set is made in Germany of a high-carbon stainless steel that combines chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium for tensile strength, hardness, and resistance to corrosion. Full-length tangs (meaning the metal blade continues all the way through to the end of the handle) give you a stronger and better balanced knife and fork. Three rivets keep the tangs attached to the black hygienic composition handles. Both the knife and fork feel substantial and balanced in your hand. Although they are dishwasher-safe, it's best to hand wash them to keep their steel scratch-free. <I>--Doree Armstrong</I>"	COL title VAL "Dyson DC07 upright vacuum - pink" COL feature VAL "Available in Purple, Purple/Scarlet, or Yellow. Dyson has run out of Pink." COL description VAL "Designed by engineering guru James Dyson, inventor of the cyclonic vacuum, the 12-amp Dyson DC07 upright is an inspired combination of power & structural smarts. At the center of the machine's innovation is the Cyclone air path design, an eight-section chamber that creates powerful, consistent suction. The conical chambers generate 100,000 g of centrifugal force, pushing dust and dirt out of the airflow into the vacuum's 1-gallon collection cup. With no bag to clog, the vacuum's 270 air watts of suction remain steady. The large, transparent collection cup is easy to check and empties tidily--pop it off, hold it over a trash bin, and pull the trigger to release dirt without having to touch it. The DC07 also comes equipped with a multipart filtration system to improve overall air quality in the home. The HEPA filter, measuring 412 square inches in surface area, traps microscopic particulates & allergens. Expertly built, the filter is designed to last the lifetime of the machine.  Suitable for bare floors and carpets, it features a 14-inch cleaning path and edge-cleaning bristles. A simple foot pedal switches off the brush roll for bare floors, & the nozzle automatically adjusts for changes in carpet height. The vacuum is equipped for above-floor cleaning with a cleverly stowed, quick-release 17-foot hose with a reversible, extension-wand handle. Onboard accessories include a crevice tool, a dusting brush, & an upholstery attachment, all designed to function without "sticking" to surfaces. Made from the same material used in crash helmets, the vacuum is unquestionably durable. Plus, the design only puts 4 pounds of weight on the handle, so pushing & turning is easy. This model comes with a 35-foot power cord and a 3-yr warranty.  Editor's note: This is a remanufactured appliance. Remanufactured generally means that the appliance has been returned to the manufacturer, who returns the appliance to like-new condition. Some appliances may contain cosmetic blemishes."	0

At the time our house consisted of a bunch of good friends, a half pipe, pool table, ping pong table and shaping room all just across the street from some nice smooth hills down to the reefs. One of our friends from Hawaii who used to call people "nine balls" all the time in a friendly razzing sort of way, called up on the phone one day to see what was going on at the house. He got the answering machine and said "What's going on over there at Sector 9?" which to him and us meant a house full of nine balls. The message on the machine was heard and the name not only had a nice ring to it but seemed fitting as well so it stuck. The interest had been apparent from everyone who saw us skate by so we started making skateboards in our backyard. Lots of learning and a couple evictions later we were forced to move into our first warehouse in what would become the Sector 9 skateboard factory. Since then we have continued to push our designs and materials to their limits in order to offer the best quality skateboard for all types of riding"	0

The Winning Moves Deluxe Pit Card Game is a hilariously frenzied game of commodities that's sure to provide hours of fun and laughter. Shout your deal and trade your cards to "corner" the market; be the first to get all the cards of one product, ring the bell and win the hand. Looking for a sure winner in the hot commodities market? Pit, the fast-paced card game from Parker Brothers, has been a bullish performer since its introduction way back in 1904. With all the ups and downs, desperate deals, and nonstop action of an actual trading floor, this lively game offers great fun without risking the family fortune. The rules are simple: Deal the cards, wait for the opening bell, scream and trade like crazy, be the first to corner a specific market (nine cards of the same suit), and ring the closing bell. Sounds pretty realistic, doesn't it? Once you've got the basic game mastered, try throwing Bull and Bear cards into the mix--that's when things get really interesting!<P> Pit comes neatly boxed with a set of durable game cards, instructions, and a heavy-duty metal bell that's great for slamming. There are rules included for a silent bidding version of the game, but jumping up and down, gesticulating wildly, and shouting yourself hoarse is half the fun. <i>--George Laney</i>"	COL title VAL "Winning Moves Games Classic Pit" COL feature VAL "Corner the Market Card Game Includes a bell and Original Turn-of-the-Century Artwork Ages 8 and up 3 to 8 Players Nostalgic Tin Case" COL description VAL "Shout your deal and trade your cards to "corner" the market.

Designed by musician Jeff Kile and integrating a pentatonic (five-note) scale, this phenomenal set of wind chimes impresses with its design and tone. Unlike most wind chimes, Grace Note's chimes are suspended from interior pins placed at the resonant node: this unique suspension design allows the chimes to resonate longer and clearer. The tempered aluminum of the chimes, which hang from an aluminum ring, is a better conductor of sound than brass or bronze. The redwood or cedar striker eliminates harsh overtones and is rot resistant. The chord and notes the chimes play are engraved on the lightweight aluminum wind plate (in this case, it's A, C, D, E, G, A, A min +11).

WaterDog senses your dog's approach, and automatically dispenses a cool, clean stream of fresh drinking water. Smart sonar sensing technology triggers the WaterDog to turn the water on when your pet comes within 3 feet (1 meter), and turns it off when your pet leaves. You'll never have to worry about what your dog's been drinking again. Constructed of durable, high-quality UV resistant materials, the WaterDog has been designed to provide many years of reliable service. The WaterDog's hose has a metal covering to protect it from chewing and to reflect heat to help keep the water cool, even on bright sunny days.

A sonar-based proximity sensor triggers the WaterDog to turn the water on when your pet comes within three feet (one meter), and turns it off when your pet leaves. Dogs quickly learn that they can always get a drink from the WaterDog. This greatly reduces the risk of your dog becoming dehydrated on a hot day, or developing disease from a contaminated water bowl.

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for 19th-century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. The company even fabricated and erected a series of IBM "tent cities" just outside Binghamton, housing thousands of IBM salesmen during the company's annual stockholders meeting, which had outgrown its previous locale. With the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, renowned explorer Sir Edmund Hillary used Eureka's new and innovative Draw-Tite tent--with its practical, freestanding external frame--in a Himalayan expedition to Nepal (Hillary had climbed to the summit of Mt. Everest only six years earlier). In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants during the first all-American Mt. Everest Expedition, where explorers braved fierce 60-plus mph winds and temperatures reached below -20F. Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s, targeting it to backpackers and families. The first to employ the StormShield design, the lightweight, self-supporting backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents in the industry, with sales reaching over 1 million by its 10-year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as companions on other historic expeditions, including the American Women's Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988.

Dimensions: -Overall Product Weight:10.2 We all know that cats dislike water, but many dogs are also skittish when it comes to baths, running and hiding at the first drip from the hose. Unfortunately, that doesnt stop pets from getting into the garbage, rolling in the dirt (or worse), or tangling with wild critters. Lenteks waterless pet bath brush provides an alternative to the traditional bath. Pets relax for a brushing session--something most animals do like--as the pet brush soundlessly circulates 100 trillion air-cleansing ions per second through the animals fur to remove even the nastiest odors. Operating via one 9-volt battery (not included), a flashing green light indicates that the brush is on, while a red light warns that the battery is getting low on power. One complete brushing cycle lasts 5 minutes before the tool automatically shuts off. The bath brush has soft plastic bristles, and additional heads--with either plastic or metal bristles--are sold separately. <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>"	COL title VAL "Chris Christensen A621 Ionic Brush, Purple" COL feature VAL "The Chris Christensen Purple Ionic Brass and Nylon brushes are made with solid brass inner bristles to distribute natural oils The Purple Ionic Brass and Nylon brush is made for short coated breeds and hand-stripped wire coated breeds Purple Ionic Brush SM A621" COL description VAL "The Chris Christensen Purple Ionic Brass and Nylon brushes are made with solid brass inner bristles to distribute natural oils.

The Precor EFX 5.17i Elliptical CrossTrainer makes it easy to stay with your exercise routine and reap the benefits of a life in motion. The 5.17i CrossRamp angle adjusts from 12 to 25 degrees, altering the height of the elliptical path. Called Variable Stride Geometry, this allows you to focus on a specific lower body muscle group, or all major lower body muscle groups. The 5.17i offers up to 4 pre-set programs and 20 resistance levels to keep you motivated. An intuitive membrane console with easy-to-read display combines multiple feedback options and a simple QuickStart to help you monitor your workouts for optimal results. Precor quality has been time-tested in health clubs and exercise facilities worldwide. With its home-friendly design and smooth, natural motion, it&#8217;s a great fit for you and your lifestyle.

The EFX 5.17i is outfitted with Precor's CrossRamp technology, which is fully adjustable from 12 to 25 degrees. This helps the crosstrainer efficiently isolate and work your glutes, quads, hamstrings, and calves, a key to effective aerobic exercise. In fact, studies indicate that elliptical crosstrainers yield greater lower-body benefits than stairclimbers, stationary bikes, or treadmills, making them ideal for both casual users and athletes in training. In addition, crosstrainers minimize the impact on your joints and lower back, inviting you to exercise more vigorously and burn more calories. <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="200"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/B001L5TL30-console.jpg" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/B001L5TL30-ramp.jpg" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The EFX 5.17i features an intuitive membrane console and adjustable CrossRamp (12 to 25 percent) technology.</strong></em></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> The EFX 5.17i is a breeze to use thanks to the comprehensive membrane console, which offers intuitive keystroke sequencing, multiple feedback options, large LED displays, and accompanying graphics.

COL title VAL "Bachmann Industries #4425 USRA 0-6-0 Switcher Locomotive and Tender Union Pacific Train Car, Black/Silver, N Scale" COL feature VAL "Die cast chassis and metal handrails Skew wound motor with bronze bearings, Engine and tender electrical pick-up Traction tires for greater pulling power, Preforms best on 11.25" Radius curves or greater E-Z Mate Mark II coupler on Tender N Scale 1:160 Locomotive Cars (Rolling Stock) E-Z Track  available in either black roadbed with steel alloy rail or gray roadbed with nickel silver rail Terminal/Rerailer Terminal Wire Speed Controller Power Supply List of Components Instructions Decide where to set up your train  a dry, firm, flat surface works best! To make sure you have enough working room, make a test track layout by loosely placing track in desired configuration. The terminal/rerailer section will later be connected to a power pack and power supply, so place it near an outlet or power strip. Install under-track magnet, if your set comes with one. If your set does not come with one, magnets are available separately (HO Item No. 78999; N Scale Item No. 78998). Assemble the track by pushing together. Make sure the rail and joiners are seated properly. Be careful that the rail joiners do not slip under the rail without properly connecting. This can cause train derailments and electrical circuit interruptions. After track is assembled, double-check for joint connection and fit by lightly running your fingers over the top of the rails in both directions. If you detect bumps or distortion on the track surface, recheck the rail joiner fit. Power supply and speed control are plug and play; no tools are needed. Power is supplied to the track and the locomotive by the power supply, speed controller, terminal wire, and E-Z Track terminal/rerailer. First  turn knob on the speed controller counterclockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Next  attach terminal wire to the speed controller by plugging it in where it says &#039;To Track.&#039; Then  plug terminal wire into the E-Z Track terminal rerailer. Firmly push connector onto the track terminals. Finally  plug the connecting wire from the power supply into jack on the speed controller labeled IN. Then plug power supply into a live wall outlet. Some sets may come with a speed controller with two push button connectors. These are used to supply AC power to accessories. To make positive and secure connections to these, push in buttons and insert each of the bare ends of the connection wire from your accessory. The speed controller is capable of powering one accessory at a time. Put the locomotive on the track and run the wheels back and forth over the terminal rerailer track. When the wheels glide smoothly over the track, you know the wheels are all on the track. If your set comes with a tender, attach it to the locomotive. Add the rest of the cars that come with your set by placing them on the track and running them back and forth over the terminal rerailer until they glide smoothly. Then gently push the cars together  they will engage automatically. Do not try to connect cars when positioned over an under-track magnet. Your set may be equipped with E-Z Mate magnetically operated knuckle couplers that let you perform real railroad switching and yard operations. Coupling two cars with E-Z Mate couplers is as easy as pushing them together when they are not over an under-track magnet. Uncoupling occurs only when over an under-track magnet and when there is no tension between the cars. To uncouple E-Z Mate couplers, stop two couplers directly over the under-track magnet. With no tension between the cars, the couplers will open automatically. If cars will not couple, check to be sure cars are not positioned over the uncoupling magnet or parked on a curve. If cars will not uncouple, check to be sure the couplers are positioned directly adjacent to the magnet position indicator and that the indicator is placed in line with the center line of the under-track magnet. Check that the magnet is secured to the underside of the track and fitted with the steel plate provided. Turn the knob on the speed controller clockwise until it stops (all the way to the left). Plug in the power supply. Begin feeding power to the track by slowly turning the knob on the speed controller clockwise. Observe the direction of your train. If it moves backwards when the controls indicate forward, stop the train. Then simply disconnect, flip, and reconnect the terminal wire to the terminal rerailer track. Remember  never leave your train running unattended! Is the power supply plugged in to a live receptacle? Are the wheels on the track? Is the wiring secure? Is the track properly assembled? Is the track properly seated in the rail joiner? If your train stops or fails to start, a short circuit may be indicated. If this is the case, Unplug the power supply immediately. Common reasons for a short circuit: derailed wheels may cause a short. Check to make sure all wheels are on the track. Also check all connections and make sure there is no metal of any sort across the rails. After checking everything carefully, resume operation. Please note, your power supply is protected by a circuit breaker that automatically resets after a short circuit is corrected. Allow up to 5 minutes for the circuit breaker to reset before resuming operation. Works better after couple hours of break-in time. Train performs best under clean operating conditions. Clean wheels and a clean track ensure good electrical contact. After about every 8 hours of operation, wipe the track rails and exposed wheels with a soft, lint-free cloth. Removal of black residue is normal. Do not use steel wool to clean your track. Do not use common solvents, they may damage plastics - use track cleaner. After 24 hours of use, light lubrication is required to keep train in top operating condition. Do not use common household lubricants as they may damage your trains. Bachmann E-Z Lube or other hobby-grade lubricants are recommended."

Its beautiful cabinet, constructed of solid beechwood and furniture grade beech veneer, contains separate motors that allow you to grind and flake simultaneously or independently. Included with the KoMo Duett is a handmade ceramic bowl with a cool, smooth surface that complements the mill's warm finish. Oats are a naturally soft grain and more of our customers roll oats than any other grain in their Duett&mdash;but many other grains including wheat, rye, barley and millet can be flaked too, with a little preparation. If you want the full range of capability from grinder to flaker, the KoMo Duett offers significant savings compared to buying a mill and a flaker separately. The grinder side will grind hard or soft wheat, oat groats (dehulled oats), rice, triticale, kamut, spelt, buckwheat, barley, rye, millet, teff, quinoa, amaranth, sorghum and dent (field) corn. It will also grind lentils, dry beans (pinto, red, garbanzo, kidney &amp; more), and dried, non-oily spices. It isn't suitable for herbs, oilseeds like flax or sesame, popcorn, or fibrous materials. Capacity of the grinder hopper is 2 lb., 10 oz. The 600 watt motor of the Duett 200 produces 10-11 ounces per minute for bread flour texture. The KoMo Duett has precisely fitted corundum-ceramic burrs that are adjustable to grind to any texture you choose, from exceedingly fine flour to coarse meal (just cracked if you wish). All by simply rotating the hopper to align with your choice on the front texture setting scale. The flaker has a 6.4 oz. hopper and its 140 watt motor flakes 2.8 to 3.5 oz. of oats per minute. Flake thickness is adjustable from .3mm to .65mm. The Duett's flaker is perfect for rolling all softer grains like oat groats. As with all KoMo grinders, cleanup is minimal and easy and access to the milling chamber takes just a moment and requires no tools."	0

It all depends on how musically knowledgeable you and your teammates are. Each of the 250 small playing cards lists song titles in five categories: Broadway Musicals, Folk &amp; Family Favorites, Oldies, TV &amp; Movies, and Contemporary. As teams go around the colorful music note game board, they land on category boxes. The designated guessers then attempt to name the song title from the category, which the designated hummer tries to convey. A turn of the enclosed plastic timer allows a mere 30 seconds to hum tunes as well known as "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" or as obscure as "Walk the Dinosaur."

COL description VAL "Encore Deluxe Clear your throat and drink that honey-lemon tea: It's time to play Encore, the game of dueling larynxes. The goal is to come up with a song that contains particular words--and then sing lines from the song that contains those words. Here's how it works: The first team turns up a card featuring five words; the two teams then take turns singing at least six words of any song that contains one of those five. The round continues until one team is stumped, which, if the word is "love," could take a while. But repetition is not allowed, and for every "said" and "moon," there's a "highway" or "piano"--whaddya do when you've exhausted the Billy Joel songbook? And it's great to draw a lyric that's in a song title, but if you don't know five others that come after, you'll be like the player who drew "nice"; he spent the entire run of the sand timer with his shoulders hunched like Sinatra because he couldn't connect "and let's make all the stops along the way" with the song's title, "Nice 'N' Easy." Oh, and don't play Encore with Renaissance Faire actors--when they draw the word "lady," they'll come up with an inexhaustible supply of 15th-century madrigals. Only after they've won will you discover that they were all bogus. <I>--Tony Mason</I>"	1

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. <strong>About Horizon Fitness</strong><br> Horizon is part of Johnson Health Tech, one of the largest manufacturers of fitness equipment in the world. They are committed to designing, engineering, and manufacturing superior products for health clubs and homes.

Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary."	1
