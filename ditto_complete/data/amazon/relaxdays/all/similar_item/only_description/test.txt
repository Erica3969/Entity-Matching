Working out on an elliptical can burn as many calories as working out on a treadmill. Yet unlike treadmills, ellipticals are non-impact machines, making them perfect for anyone who has knee problems or is concerned about osteoarthritis. They also offer more variety than treadmills, allowing you to go forward and backward, as well as adjust stride length to target different muscle groups. || *** FOR EXCELLENT SHIPPING RATES, PLEASE CONTACT US BEFORE MAKING A PURCHASE. *** The reconditioned commercial grade, health club Precor EFX 546 elliptical features a no-impact, forward or reverse elliptical stride that lets you adjust ramp and resistance for cross training benefits. The Precor EFX 546 allows you to stride smoothly while holding the handrails or moving your arms in natural sync, with or without hand weights. The electronically adjustable Cross Ramp lets you change the slope of the stride with the touch of a key to vary muscle emphasis. Designed for heavy commercial use, the Precor EFX 546 Elliptical features sturdy construction, eight programs, and 20 resistance levels.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

From one of Henckels' moderately priced cutlery lines, these eight steak knives divide any rib eye, chop, or roast into bite-size pieces and then store in a handsome wood box. The thin, curved blades are perfect for precise cutting, although their fine serrations tend to tear meat fibers rather than slice neatly through them. Stamped from high-carbon stainless steel, the knives are lighter in weight than forged knives and don't have bolsters, which might not be essential when confronting a thick prime rib. The synthetic handles feature classic three-rivet styling with full tangs for strength. The storage box is stained a rich auburn.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you.

The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop.

We cannot be responsible in the case that the plants are confiscated at customs. Century plant (Agave americana) is naturalised in many parts of Australia, but has a somewhat scattered distribution. It has been recorded from many parts of Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and south-eastern South Australia. It is also naturalised on Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. Because it is very difficult to collect, herbarium records probably greatly underestimate the actual distribution of this species in Australia. Possibly also naturalised in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Two varieties (i.e. Agave americana var. americana and Agave americana var. expansa) and one cultivar (i.e. Agave americana 'Marginata') have been recorded amongst naturalised populations in Australia. Some state herbaria do not distinguish between these taxa, so the actual ditributions of different varieties is not well known. This species is also naturalised in many other parts of the world, including Europe, the Canary Islands, southern China, southern Africa and New Zealand."	0

COL description VAL "2oz of 45um Glow in the Dark AQUA Pigment Powder. SALES PRODUCT does NOT include the glass jar, comes in a clear Poly bag. </br> PLEASE NOTE: SrA12O4:Eu is a solid odorless, nonflammable, pale yellow powder, heavier than water. It is chemically and biologically inert. When activated with a suitable dopant (Europium) it takes on a different structure and becomes a phosphorescence emitting its glow. It now requires UV (Ultra Violet) in the higher spectrum to charge the crystals and make them GLOW. UV light is the electromagnetic radiation from sunlight with a wavelength shorter than white light. </br> In summer the powder supercharges because of the UV rays from sunlight, and this makes the powder REALLY POP. However, in the winter months when there is limited UV in the suns rays it is harder to charge the powder. We use UV black lights to help charge the powders in the winter months. These are specially designed black lights you can purchase from stores. </br> We DO NOT give glow times on our products because we cannot guarantee this, there are too many factors involved, some we have already spoken about. </br> This pigment is daytime invisible, meaning it is an off-white color during the day & glows its individual color in the dark. </br> ALL PHOTOS AND IMAGES PROPERTY OF GLOMANIA & PROGLOW USA, NAIL ART COURTESY OF MARY FINOCCHIARO"	COL description VAL "KOKUYO Scissors Aero fit SAXA (titanium glue-less blade) HASA-PT250DM"	0

COL description VAL "A special calcium supplement plus other macro and vital trace elements boosted by vitamin D3 to help rear young animals and treat calcium deficiencies. Mineral elements are extremely important for maintaining good health, top stamina and uninterrupted reproduction. The most important factor, whether in respect to diets or food supplements, is not only the number of individual substances but, above all, their well-balanced and well-matched composition. The mineral elements frequently operate in balanced pairs or in small groups. For example, it is a comparatively well-known fact that the nutritional role of calcium (Ca) is closely related to that of phosphorus (P) and in correlation to one another can prevent rickets and osteomalacia. Because of this, a large proportion of vitamin D3 has been added to NEKTON-MSA to help attune the Ca-P ratio to the requirements of each individual organism. By means of vitamin D3, calcium and phosphorus are better deposited in the animal's bones, thus achieving full benefit of the mineral supply. NEKTON-MSA is primarily for animals during breeding, gestation and lactation. At these times an animal needs more minerals. An increased dose of calcium, for example, reduces the fragility of cage-birds' eggs. In fact an animal suffering from calcium deficiency diseases can be helped back to good health through NEKTON-MSA."

It softens water by precipitating calcium and magnesium while removing any chlorine, chloramine, or ammonia. The use of neutral regulator makes other conditioning unnecessary. To lower pH below 7.0 use neutral regulator with acid regulator (or discus buffer). to raise pH above 7.0 use with Alkaline regulator.

The remote also serves as a carrying case, featuring a small, clear compartment that easily holds the Nitro Speeder. This way, you can carry all the tools you need in one simple piece that fits comfortably in your hand. With their small size and microchip technology, Nitro Speeders can make super-precise, high-speed turns and feature responsive control in all directions.

Our testers were impressed by the acceleration and speed the Nitro Speeders could reach, and had fun learning how to use the controllers to make swift, sharp turns on hard indoor surfaces. Testers found that at first the extreme speeds of the Nitro Speeders often caused the vehicles to flip over. However, after reading the quick tips in the provided instructions and some practice with the controller, the drivers' coordination improved and Nitro Speeders became easier to drive.

Working together, these highly effective media eliminate liquefied impurities, odors and discoloration, while simultaneously removing toxic ammonia, for a clean, healthy aquarium. The Fluval C4 Zeo-Carb Filter Insert was made exclusively for the Fluval C4 Power Filter. <div class="aplus"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> <h3>Fluval Zeo-Carb - 3-Pack</h3> The Fluval C Zeo-Carb Filter Insert combines ammonia removal with ultra-grade carbon purification. Working together, these highly effective media eliminate liquefied impurities, odors and discoloration, while simultaneously removing toxic ammonia, for a clean, healthy aquarium. The Fluval C Zeo-Carb Filter Insert was made exclusively for the Fluval C Power Filter. Engineered to create superior water quality, the Fluval C Power Filter provides extensive 5-stage filtration for outstanding results. The Power Filter is designed to provide maximum surface area and optimum dwell times in all stages of the filtration process. <b>Stage 1 & 2: Mechanical- Poly/Foam Pad</b> Effective mechanical filtration is essential for efficient chemical and biological filtration. The large surface area of the Poly/Foam pad effectively performs two stages of Mechanical filtration. The first stage of porous foam traps large particles and the second stage of dense polyester captures fine debris. <b>Stage 3: Chemical- Activated Carbon Insert</b> The Fluval Activated Carbon Filter Insert contains 100% premium research grade carbon, which provides large amounts of surface area for adsorption of undesirable impurities. The activated carbon filter insert removes unwanted odors, discoloration and impurities, resulting in a crystal clear aquarium. <b>Stage 4: Biological-Bio-Screen</b> An additional hydraulic circuit conveys part of the intake water to the Bio-Screen placed at the top of the Trickle Chamber cover. Fluvals Bio-Screen removes any debris before dripping into the biological chamber. It also ensures that the water pumped to the Trickle Chamber is evenly spread through all areas before it drips on the C-Nodes, which are contained in the chamber. The motion of water dropping slowly through the grids mimics the rain. <b>Stage 5: Biological- C-Nodes</b> The surface of the C-Nodes is made up of a complex pore system that provides optimal living space for beneficial bacteria to thrive and enhance the removal of ammonia and nitrites. The new Star Shape provides a higher filtration surface and more biological power than a traditional cartridge, resulting in a healthy aquarium environment. Sometimes delicate fish and plants require a more gentle water flow. Fluvals patented re-filtration system allows you to control the flow rate without compromising filtration efficiency. When the flow rate is reduced, up to 50% of the water within the filter chamber is re-processed multiple times. More impurities are filtered out, creating a healthier tank with sparkling clean and clear water 1. Filter Cover 2. Filter Case 3. Leveling Device 4. C-Nodes 5. U Tube 6. Telescopic Intake Tube 7.

COL description VAL "Offered is a 65 Piece Set of Stainless Steel flatware in the Oneida Wordsworth pattern."	COL description VAL "The ZWILLING TWIN Gourment Classic line features precision steel and a single piece stamped construction. ZWILLING Special Formula, high carbon no-stain steel blades are FRIODUR ice-hardened to be durable, stay sharp, and not rust. Classic Triple Riveted Handle for comfort, durability and strength. Made in Spain, lifetime warranty. Removed from their slots in this set's rubber-footed wood storage block, these eight knives slice any steak, chop, or roast into bite-size pieces. Gourmet is one of Henckels's inexpensive cutlery lines. These knives don't have bolsters, but that feature isn't vital when confronting a rib eye. The high-carbon, stainless-steel 4-1/2-inch blades are stamped, not forged, and because they are serrated on the upper halves, they tend to tear meat fibers rather than slice precisely through them the way straight-edge knives do. On the other hand, the fine serrations reduce the tearing effect, and the blades' lower halves are straight. The synthetic, three-rivet, full-tang handles are classically styled. <I>--Fred Brack</I> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> Eight 4-1/2-inch steak knives, beechwood storage block"	0

Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

COL description VAL "Jade is a gemstone of much history, it has been part of Asian philosophy for centuries. It is often called the "dream stone" for its ability to help one access the non-physical spirit realms. It is a protective stone, and acts as a ward against negative energies. Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy. Jade can be used as a dream-enhancer by slipping a mala of it under your pillow or inside your pillow case while sleeping. THE MALA HAS BEEN HAND KNOTTED (KNOT BETWEEN EACH BEAD). Blessed and Energized with proper Mantras, Pujas and Spiritually activated by SWAMI BUDHIRAJA to give best results. Since a Yantra and Mala is a Man-Made object, it requires energization to infuse potency and power to benefit the owner.

COL description VAL "The Stamina Air 1725 Cross Trainer Elliptical gives you air resistance and electronically controlled tension for a workout that targets cardiovascular fitness and shapes and tones legs, hips, glutes, and abs. Elliptical trainer workouts burn a similar number of calories as jogging but without the risk of injury to the back, knees, hips, or ankles. Since your feet never leave the pedals the Stamina Air 1725 Cross Trainer gives a low-impact workout that is easy on your joints. In fact, whereas jogging, jumping rope, aerobics classes, and exercising on a treadmill all require your body to absorb the force of impact, exercising on an elliptical can be compared to running in midair. Because ellipticals are so low impact and easy on the joints, they are also a good choice for older people or for individuals who have old injuries. Up and down buttons adjust the resistance to control the intensity of your workout. The monitor's built-in fingertip pulse sensor tracks your heart rate so you work out within your target heart rate zone. Elliptical trainers mimic the natural path of the foot, the extension of the leg, and the rotation of the hip during walking or running. This motion uses all the leg muscles, giving you a total lower body workout while the dual action arms work your upper body and let you increase or decrease intensity. Work your arms harder to tone and to burn more calories. The foot pedals can be worked in a forward or reverse direction. Resistance may be added as desired to increase the workload on your legs throughout the forward or backward stride to tone thighs and glutes. Combining air resistance and electronically controlled tension, the compact and affordable Stamina Air 1725 elliptical cross trainer provides a cardiovascular workout in your home that also helps shape and tone legs, hips, glutes, and abs.

In fact, whereas jogging, jumping rope, aerobics classes, and exercising on a treadmill all require your body to absorb the force of impact, exercising on an elliptical can be compared to running in midair. Because ellipticals are so low impact and easy on the joints, they are also a good choice for older people or for individuals who have old injuries. <table align=right width=350 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/stamina-1725-monitor.jpg" border=0 align=top width=350 height=333><br><br><small><i><b>The Stamina 1725 exercise monitor.

The foot pedals can be worked in a forward or reverse direction. Resistance may be added as desired to increase the workload on your legs throughout the forward or backward stride to tone thighs and glutes.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

COL description VAL "Cuisinart DGB-300BK 10 cup coffee maker, black. Freshly ground coffee: The coffeemaker lets you grind your favorite coffee beans and then automatically puts the grounds into the filter to brew. Fully programmable with an easy to read LCD display for auto-on function and variable heater plate setting. Great Taste: The coffee bar flavor system is the same special brewing system found in commercial coffeemakers. Simply set the number of cups being brewed, for coffee bar flavor at home. Long lasting taste: The Taste KeeperTM lid is designed to minimize oxygen flow into the carafe so coffee stays fresher, longer. Express Coffee: The brew pause feature allows you to pour a cup of coffee before brewing has finished. Consistent Flavor: The 1-4 cup setting allows you to make only a cup or two without altering the flavor of the brew. Variable automatic shutoff, self clean setting with time to clean monitor, grind off function, 1-4 cup setting, large LCD clock, cord storage, and 3-year limited warranty. For coffee that's as fresh as the neighborhood coffee shop, but served at home, try Cuisinart's Automatic Grind and Brew coffeemaker. It makes it easy to enjoy fresh coffee with the utmost convenience--ground whole-bean coffee pours directly into the filter basket at a pre-set time for instant brewing. The maker does all the thinking, with a range of programmable features: set the machine to grind and brew at exactly the right time, predetermine the coffee's temperature, and program the machine to turn off a half-hour later.<P><P>Other features take the guess work out of coffeemaking as well: the flavor setting ensures the optimal amount of water is used for a rich, aromatic taste and no acidity or bitterness, and the large easy-view water window makes sure the right amount of water is added. A self-clean feature lets you know when calcium buildup is interfering with the machine's operation; turn on the self-clean cycle to make quick work of grime. Daily cleaning of the machine is somewhat involved since all individual parts must be removed, so prepare for slightly longer clean up in exchange for time-saving upfront.<P><P>Two additional caveats: The grinder is noisy, as most grinders are, and cannot be turned off midgrind. And the coffee bar is taller than average coffee machines, so make sure you have a spot for it with plenty of below cupboard space. <I>--Emily Wolf</I>"	COL description VAL "The Cuisinart brew Central 12 cup programmable coffeemaker makes a bold statement in any kitchen With a brushed metal finish and elegant tech-industrial design.

Fill the round dish with herbs, spices, cider, juices or beer; as your chicken rests on the stand, the aromas and flavors from the liquids and herbs pass through the perforations on the cone shaped top, filling the cavity of the bird and adding moisture to the meat as it roasts. Instructions on using the vertical roaster are included. If your last experiment with a vertical roaster led to the bird tipping on its tripod base and landing in the grease pouring out of its cavity, here's a chance to get it right. This Norpro model is versatile enough to serve as a horizontal 13-by-8-1/2-inch rack for roasts. And it easily but sturdily converts to vertical roasting by anchoring up to four hooked pieces to the slats of the flat rack, enabling two birds to roast on this roost, cooking evenly inside and out, with no danger of capon cartwheel. Flipping the bird, so to speak, is a thing of the past--there's no need to pull the rack out of the oven halfway through cooking--and you may as well roast two while you have the heat cranked up (put one in the freezer for next week). Cleanup is fairly easy, too; just be sure to use a nonabrasive sponge or squeegee to preserve the nonstick coating. <i>--Tony Mason</i>"	COL description VAL "Norpro S/S Vertical Poultry Roaster This roaster will allow you to infuse your chicken with flavors and it will help produce moist chicken. It holds up to 8 pounds and disassembles for easy storage.Model #: 266 Material: Stainless steel Color: Silver Holds up to 8 pounds Instructions included Hand wash Disassembles Height: 8-3/4" Diameter: 7" Shipping weight: .55 lb 113461 Norpro's vertical poultry roaster is designed to allow fats to drip off your chicken or other poultry as it cooks, leaving only juicy, flavorful, lower-fat meat. The deep drip tray collects the fat so that it doesn't coat your oven, although putting a baking sheet under the roaster is advisable for larger birds. The vertical roaster promotes even cooking, since all sides are exposed to the oven's heat. This configuration also makes the skin exceptionally crispy, a feature which will be lost on those who discard the skin for health reasons The drip tray and rack are both made of stainless steel, which conducts heat quickly and evenly. <i>--Julija Gelazis</i>"	1
COL description VAL "With its ample dimensions and burly construction, this commercial 5-quart KitchenAid mixer is prepared to be a culinary beast of burden. Smartly engineered so that the beater moves clockwise while the shaft moves counterclockwise, the beater reaches every part of the bowl without requiring it to rotate. 5 mixing speeds plus a stir setting means the appliance can do everything from folding cranberries into biscotti to whipping up a fluffy meringue. The all-metal construction includes a heavy-duty motor to handle stiff batters and a hardwearing transmission that ensures continuous power. The mixers seamless, stainless-steel, 5-quart bowl stands flat on its indented base and features sealed handle and bracket connections that meet NSF standards. A professional-style bowl lift raises it easily and securely into position, even if its brimming with weighty dough. The mixer comes with a burnished flat beater, a burnished dough hook, and a commercial wire whip. The flat beater is perfect for mixing cake batters, mashing potatoes, and stirring quick breads. The dough hook comes in handy for breads and coffee cakes, and the wire whip is your tool for icings and whipped cream. 4 sealed rubber feet hold the mixer stably in place, and a 3-wire, 6-foot power cord meets commercial requirements. As a safety mechanism, the overload reset button pops out if the mixer is overloaded, and the motor shuts off. If you only bake occasionally, a less heavy-duty unit will do the job. But if you work or recreate in the kitchen, this hard-working mixer can keep the pace. <i>--Emily Bedard</i> Editors note: This is a reconditioned appliance.

The high quality carbon provides a large porous area to trap minute particles. Besides providing a small sieve for mechanical trapping of organic wastes, carbon also removes liquid wastes from water. These include urine, dyes or impurities in solution. This action provides sparkling clear water in the aquarium. The large internal surface area also provides numerous points for important bacterial colonies to form and thrive. Carbon should always be removed during medication. It has also been recently noted that carbon will adsorb a large percentage of many of the nutrients in plant fertilizer products. As such, it should be used carefully when keeping live plants. Carbon loses its activity without outward sign. In general, carbon should be replaced on a monthly basis to ensure that active adsorption is maintained. <div class="aplus"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> <h5>Fluval Carbon</h5> Fluval Carbon Filter Media Insert is capable of adsorbing most liquified impurities and dyes present in aquarium water.

As the animals adapt and change, players can land on squares that advance their path ("Develop lungs. Swim ahead three spaces.") or hold them back ("Bitten by Plesiosaurus. Paddle back two spaces."). When you land on a creature, collect the matching creature cutout and place it on its skeleton on your side of the board.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate.

COL description VAL "The KONG Tug toy is great for those epic games of tugging with the waggy one who pulls hardest. Made with all-natural durable KONG Rubber for a stretchy, durable toy that springs back into shape for tons of twisty tugging action. Comfy handles make it easy for you to keep hold as you enjoy interactive play sessions. Tugging is one of a dog's most instinctive activities. In the wild, it's an important part of how packmates feed cooperatively, and in domesticated environments, it's a great energy expender for the active, playful canine. But it's important to carefully control when, how, and where a dog plays tug with a human. One of the most crucial factors is to have a toy dedicated to the game, so dogs won't think it's OK to start tugging on your socks or the leash. With this innovative, dual-material toy, Kong brings their legendary quality and durability to the game of tug. Flexible and super-strong grips are made from Kong's proprietary rubber formulation, while the rings feature durable nylon construction. Original "Control-Flex" technology prevents the toy from snapping back into one of the players' faces, promoting a safe, controlled version of a game that can sometimes get out of hand. The Kong tug measures 16-1/4 by 5-1/2 by 3/4 inches and is suitable for all sizes and breeds. <i>--Mary Park</i>  "	0

Since their humble beginnings in 1814, the Wusthof family business has adhered to the same basic set of principles regarding their products. Their Trident logo is a representation of these principles, a symbol of form, function, and uncompromising quality. Today, Wusthof stands firm behind a strong line of products, including an assortment of more than 350 forged knives, as well as cutting boards, knife blocks, kitchen tools, and scissors, all of which are produced by dedicated workers at state-of-the-art facilities in Solingen, Germany. Blade is made of high-quality material. Ergonomic handle is triple-riveted for secure grip. Perfect for carving large meats such as turkeys, roasts, or ham. Features a reverse serrated edge. Blade measures 10 inches long. A moderately priced companion to W&#xFC;sthof's renowned Classic  forged knives, this Gourmet Series 10-inch slicing knife has the same  full-tang, three-rivet, virtually indestructible poly handle as Classic  knives. Instead of being forged, however, Gourmet Series blades are cut  from steel sheets by precision lasers. That means they have no  bolsters. But it also means they are perfectly shaped and fit handles  seamlessly. And the blades' high-carbon stainless steel is identical to  that of W&#xFC;sthof's premium knives, only thinner. This knife has a blade  with large serrations (or scallops) for slicing through crusty bread,  roasts, hams, and even soft-skinned vegetables and fruits like  tomatoes. The knife is dishwasher-safe, but hand washing is recommended  to protect its edge. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	0

Adapted from an original and copyrighted design by artist and musician Ron Snider, they are handcrafted using solid brass bells for excellent sound.

An adjustable pump lets you control the water flow and frequency of ringing. This musical fountain adds beauty and charm to your home. It flourishes as a centerpiece or accent and will fill your surroundings with joy.Over 30 years ago, Grammy award-winning musician and instrument designer Garry Kvistad created the first Woodstock Chime from an aluminum lawn chair he found in a landfill. Fascinated by the Scale of Olympos, a 7th century pentatonic scale that cant be played on a modern piano, Garry cut and tuned the lawn chair tubes to the exact frequency of the ancient scale. The resulting Chimes of Olympos was the first Woodstock Chime and is still one of our best selling, musically-tuned windchimes. Garry and his wife Diane founded Woodstock Chimes in 1979 and still develop the chimes today. It remains a family-owned business in New Yorks Hudson Valley."	1

COL description VAL "FOUR STAR is the top-selling knife series of ZWILLING J.A. Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 10-inch specialty blade on this knife--sometimes called a Granton or Kullenschliff --features a ""hollow-ground"" edge specially designed for fine cutting duties. Air pockets develop in the hollows along the blade's edge, keeping even the thinnest-sliced meats from clinging to the blade. In addition to its superb meat-slicing abilities, this specialty knife is also great for slicing layer cakes and biscuit bases. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

When activated with a suitable dopant (Europium) it takes on a different structure and becomes a phosphorescence emitting its glow.

The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge.

This adorable version of the classic Candy Land game features gingerbread men as movers, colored cards, and fun illustrations that kids love, with different destinations like Cookie Commons and the chunky Chocolate Mountain. Players choose their cards, move their pawns, and let their imaginations soar as they make their way to the castle to win! For 2 to 4 players. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. "Once upon a time, King Kandy, the Imperial Head Bonbon and Grand Jujube of Candy Land disappeared." Thus begins the magical journey of Milton Bradley's classic Candy Land board game. Captivated by the story of a kidnapped king and eager to help find him, little ones move their gingerbread pawns along a rainbow path and through a land of candy characters, all subjects of King Kandy's realm. <P> Playing cards thoughtfully designed for non-readers are coded with colorful squares matching the jeweled stepping-stone path or an occasional token matching one of the characters' symbols: draw a blue card, move to the nearest blue stepping-stone; draw a snowflake and earn a visit to Queen Frostine's iceberg. There are occasional pitfalls, too: land on the wrong square and you might be stuck in Molasses Swamp until a red card is drawn. With all these enticing, sugarcoated images (and King Kandy plainly visible at path's end), children can't help but be delighted by Candy Land. It's delicious!

Featuring goofy mole cartoons, electronic lights, bell sounds, and automatic scoring, this toy is just as enticing as the real thing. Kids can choose from four different games and multiple players can join in the fun. Once the three-piece hinged tower is built, kids press the yellow arrow key until they reach the game they want to play, then press the green check mark.  When the game is announced, it's time to grab the mallet and whack that mole! Although the Whac-A-Mole Tower is easy to set up and loads of fun, there are a few minor design flaws. The tower is constructed out of plastic and our testers weren't completely sure it could hold out against relentless mallet pounding. Also, the cardboard sign on the bell comes tumbling to the ground at the slightest touch. But unless your child is a pint-sized version of Thor, the Whac-A-Mole Tower should withstand rough child play. <P>  <b>Play It</b><br> With four different games to choose from, the Whac-A-Mole Tower offers endless mole-whacking amusement. When playing hammer time, kids try to light up all nine zones in the fastest time. In lights out, players send the mole up the tower to turn off the lights and the game ends when all five areas light up at once. Hit 100 is a game of a different sort, where players must score 100 points in the fastest time, and sometimes players have to send the sliding mole all the way to the top. In 0 to 60, kids compete in a head-to-head challenge and try to be the first to score 60 points. All games can be played with more than one player, so no one will be left out of the group. <P>  <b>Testing the Tower</b><br> Our testers decided to give the mole a whack and see if this toy is as fun as it looks. After a couple minutes spent taking out aggression on the bucktooth mole, it became obvious that this is the ideal kid's toy. Not only do the four games ignite friendly competition, simply trying to get the rodent all the way up the tower is a challenge. Once the tower is turned on, a fast-paced, distracting song plays through the game selection process and during game play. Despite a few minor design flaws, the Whac-A-Mole Tower gives kids the excitement they would find at a carnival, making this toy a great choice for families.

COL description VAL "Enjoy an efficient full-body workout without heading to the gym with the Sole E95 elliptical trainer. Boasting a heavy 30-pound flywheel, a high gear ratio not found on most comparable models, and a pair of upper body handles, the E95 delivers an extremely smooth workout with plenty of top-end resistance. Users will also appreciate the unique oversize foot pedals, which were designed in collaboration with a leading physical therapist and sports enthusiast. The pedals are not only extra large, but also feature a 2-degree inward slope that reduces the ankle and knee stress that's common in other elliptical machines. The collaboration also produced a revolutionary foot pedal angle adjustment not found on any other elliptical. Taking into account that not everyone walks the same way, Sole engineers made the E95's pedals adjustable to fit the way you walk. This also reduces the likelihood of numb toes and sore Achilles tendons. Workout specifics include 20 resistance levels, 10 total programs (including two custom and two heart-rate programs), and a 20-inch stride length. Perhaps the handiest feature from a user perspective, however, is the easy-to-use electronic console, which integrates a red/green display, a cooling fan, and a water bottle holder. Additional features include stationary handlebars with built-in pulse sensors for monitoring your heart rate; a heart rate chest strap for hands-free pulse monitoring; heavy-duty rails with smooth-riding wheels on the back; and a rear plastic shroud that adds additional stability for aggressive use.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

Saute, poach, or braise in the S16G; it's also great for an after-school grilled cheese, Sunday pancakes, or pan-fried trout. Turned down to "warm," it even works as a chafing dish on a buffet table. Sensitive temperature control means a boil can reduce to a simmer in seconds, much like cooking over a gas burner. The dial reads in degrees like the dial of an oven; the 300-degree mark on the temperature control is equivalent to medium, a good heat for pan frying. A glass lid shows what's cooking without having to remove the lid. Both the interior and exterior of the pan are coated with a Dupont Teflon nonstick surface; to avoid scratching it, wooden and nylon utensils are best. The pan is fully immersible after removing the temperature control probe, so clean-up takes only a few quick swipes of a warm, soapy sponge. (Nylon scrubbers only; steel wool will scratch the nonstick finish). The cooking surface measures 16 by 12 inches; the actual dimensions of the appliance, including handles and legs, are 19-1/2 by 12 by 5-1/2 inches.

COL description VAL "UPC Code: 230173, dimension:18.75x4.5x1.75 inches Although steels often are touted as sharpening tools, few actually sharpen knife blades but do perform the vital task of realigning, or "resetting," edges, which bend when contacting a cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool's surface contains diamond dust, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. While using this steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings. This steel will also perform better than a steel without diamond dust because it accomplishes the final task of a professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine point while realigning the edge. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it, and this steel's 12-inch rod handles all household knives. The steel carries a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "Even the best knife will lose its initial sharpness during the course of time. Using a sharpening steel each time you use your knives will keep the edge aligned, resulting in a sharper, safer knife. A classic tool that helps get the best from knives, this sharpening steel is a solidly crafted addition to any knife block. Between professional sharpenings, tiny metal fibers bend down on a blade, dulling the surface. The purpose of the sharpening steel is to straighten up those fibers, maintaining the sharpest edge possible for daily use. This model is lightweight, with a flared handle and a tapered edge. It's extremely comfortable and well balanced for experienced users, but beginners may have an easier time with a more substantial weight. Just wipe it down as necessary--there's no need to give this tool a serious scrub. <I>--Jill Lightner</I>"	1

COL description VAL "<ul><li>Dimensions: 0.75 IN x 9.0 IN x 0.75 IN</ul> Designed to be your all-around knife for cutting fruits, vegetables, sandwiches, and such, this 5-inch utility knife benefits from J.A. Henckels's 260 years in the cutlery business. It's made from high-grade, rolled stainless steel, produced using Henckels's own Sintermetal Component Technology. This process allows different grades of steel to be combined to form a single integral piece capable of withstanding extreme stress--each part of the knife is made from the grade of steel with the optimum characteristics for that component. The cutting edge features a specially designed serration pattern, ensuring prolonged sharpness without resharpening. The full-length tang (meaning the metal continues all the way through to the end of the handle) gives you a better-balanced and stronger knife. The polypropylene handle with rustproof rivets is nearly indestructible. It's dishwasher-safe, but be careful that the blade doesn't touch other objects; hand washing is recommended to keep steel blades scratch free. <I>--Doree Armstrong</I>"	COL description VAL "Zwilling J.A.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

COL description VAL "In the Operation game, kids get to be the doctor and make Cavity Sam better or get the buzzer! Perform successful action noted on the cards by picking funny ailment pieces out of the game tray with a pair of tweezers. But watch out! If the tweezers touch the sides of the openings, the buzzer goes off and Cavity Sam's nose lights up! Then players look for their Specialist card that fits that action to earn an even higher fee. The player with the most money after all of the Funatomy parts have been removed wins the game! Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. Surely countless medical careers have been launched because of this humorous game. The Operation game board features Sam the patient, lying atop a red plastic "operating table" with 12 body cavities exposed. Players perform highly skilled procedures with a pair of tweezers such as removing a broken heart or butterflies in the stomach. This kind of surgery requires a steady hand! Doctors must remove the offending body part without touching the metal lining of the cavity. Touch the metal edge, and you'll set off the buzzer and make Sam's nose light up. Then the designated Specialist steps in--for double the fee! If you're playing solo, try performing all 12 operations without getting zapped. Two AA batteries are required. Operation is for one or more players. <i>--Elizabeth Ward</i>"	COL description VAL "Climb up and slide down in the exciting game of ups and downs, Chutes and Ladders! The Chutes and Ladders board game for girls and boys has been around for over 60 years and has been enjoyed by families for generations. Players can see the square marked 100, but how will they get there? If a player lands their pawn on a good deed, they can shimmy up a ladder, but land on the wrong spot and they'll shoot down a chute! No reading is required to play this simple and easy game for preschoolers. Players spin the spinner to see how many spots they'll move. Will their new spot send them down or move them up, up, up? Slip, slide and see who will win the Chutes and Ladders board game. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. Be the first to move your child-shaped playing piece from square one to square 100 on the Chutes and Ladders game board--but watch out! If you land on the square that shows you ate too much candy--Ouch!--you get a tummy ache and slide down a chute to a square a few numbers below. But if you end your turn on a good-deed square, such as helping sweep up a mess, you'll be rewarded by a ladder-climb up the board. A fantastic follow-up to <a href="/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000DMF5/${0}">Candy Land</a>, Chutes and Ladders is ideal for younger children who are still learning to take turns and just beginning to recognize numbers (the spinner stays in the single digits). It's also a gentle introduction to the higher numbers as players climb to 100 at the top of the board. And, thanks to all those chutes and ladders, it's got enough excitement to keep your 7-year-old on the edge of her seat. English and Spanish instructions are included; no reading is necessary to play. Chutes and Ladders is for two to four players. <i>--Julie Ubben</i>"	1

The filament inside an incandescent lamp must be protected so that oxygen does not reach it and cause it to evaporate on contact. Most incandescent lamps are either vacuum-sealed or gas-filled. Incandescent lamp filaments are made of tungsten. Tungsten is a metal that can operate at very high temperatures without evaporating too quickly an resulting in early lamp failure. Incandescent filaments only convert about 10 percent of the energy used into visible light, so it is necessary to use a material that can withstand extremely high temperatures. Most lamps use a coiled filament design, which has been found to be stronger and deliver better performance."	0

COL description VAL "1983 Edition Upwords takes the likes of Scrabble to new heights. Players get more power out of every word and create more play possibilities. Players can build from words crossword puzzle-style or by stacking letters on top of tiles already on the board. The challenge is to make new words each time. For example, "stack" becomes "snack," then "snapshot." If it sounds like 3-D Scrabble, there's more to know. Scoring is simpler: each tile earns two points, and each stacked tile earns one. The usual <i>No</i>s apply: no capitalized, hyphenated, or abbreviated words, etc. The set comes with 100 letter tiles, tile racks for two to four players, and a plastic game board. <i>--Lynne Sampson</i>"	COL description VAL "For over 50 years, Scrabble has turned normal families into shouting, squealing, laughing word enthusiasts! Celebrate the fun with this Deluxe edition. Enhanced gameboard features a turntable base that easily rotates the game to each player. The raised grid keeps the letter tiles in place. Includes gameboard, 100 wood letters, 4 plastic tile racks, drawstring cloth bag, score pad and sand timer. 2-4 players. Ages 8 and up. It's still hard to get a triple word score, the tiles are still made of wood, there's only one "X" in the whole box, and family feuds are increasing exponentially. But after 50 years, Scrabble has had a face-lift: a swivel base allows the board to turn so players don't have to work upside down, a plastic grid helps keep tiles in line, and a handy bag stores the letters when they're not in use. The premise hasn't changed at all--two to four players battle it out to make high-scoring words from seven little letters--so choose a dictionary before play begins to avoid ugly confrontations. <i>--Lynne Sampson</i>"	1

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. <strong>About Horizon Fitness</strong><br> Horizon is part of Johnson Health Tech, one of the largest manufacturers of fitness equipment in the world. They are committed to designing, engineering, and manufacturing superior products for health clubs and homes. Horizon's manufacturing facilities rank among the most sophisticated in the industry, with an intricate mix of robotics and skilled workers that maintain the highest standards of accuracy and quality.

The Image 8.25, which is small enough to fit in a den or rec room, is loaded with convenient features, including attached dual-action arms that help tone your upper body, digital resistance controls, and several preprogrammed workouts. The unit is built around a smooth, frictionless Silent Magnetic Resistance (SMR) system that lets you adjust your intensity without interrupting your workout.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

Specially designed with an excellent resistance to rot, abrasion, mildew, petroleum products and most chemicals. This 1/8-inch by 600-foot solid braid nylon rope reel is the strongest synthetic fiber in general use. Nylon is the strongest of all ropes, and when stretched, has a "memory" for returning to its original length. It has excellent shock absorbing elasticity. For this reason it is best for absorbing shock loads as is the case when lifting or towing. Nylon lasts four to five times longer than natural fibers because it is resistant to rot, abrasion, mildew, petroleum products, and most chemicals. It is a strong, soft, lightweight cord. Like manila, nylon has good resistance to ultraviolet deterioration from sunlight (referred to as "UV stability"). The solid braid construction is very firm, round and tightly woven with a special lock-stitch construction which prevents unraveling when cut or torn. solid braided rope stays round, and stands up especially well to chafing of blocks and pulleys. It doesn't rotate under load. The solid braid construction cannot be spliced."	COL description VAL "Solid Braid nylon a is great all purpose rope.

COL description VAL "<div class="aplus"> <h5> Advantage of Freshly Ground Spices </h5> There are many benefits to freshly grinding pepper, salt, herbs and spices for cooking and seasoning. A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity. When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: <b>Grinding mechanism: </b>Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features. <b>Design and appearance: </b>Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table decor. <b>Ease of Use: </b>A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand. Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty. Peugeot's <b>Pepper Grinding Mechanism</b> is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available Peugeot's <b>Salt Crushing Mechanism</b> features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill. Peugeot's <b>Spice Mechanism</b> is made of ceramic, and is specially designed to grind dried spices and flat leafy herbs to release their essential oils. It is particularly effective with dried aromatic herbs such as thyme, parsley, basil, oregano, and herbs de Provence, as well as dried seeds such as cumin. Peugeot's <b>Chili Pepper Mechanism</b> is made of case hardened steel for optimal hardness and resilience. This patented mechanism features a pre-cutting system and dual chamber reservoir. For use with dry, hot chilis such as birds tongue, African devils and Piri Piri. The <b>Nutmeg Shaving Mechanism</b> is made of treated stainless steel which is corrosion resistant, and offers superior edge retention. The Peugeot nutmeg shaver is equipped with a double stainless steel grater blade and a strong claw which enables the whole nutmeg to be very finely shaved, while keeping fingers safe. Intended for use with whole nutmeg nuts. Peugeot's <b>Wet Salt mechanism</b> has been specially designed for wet sea salt: a spiral guides the salt, ensuring that it does not stick together. The mechanism is made of ceramic because wet salt crystals are soft (wear is not an issue) but corrosive. Intended for use with damp sea salts such as Sel de Guerande. The <b>Coffee Grinding Mechanism</b> found in all Peugeot coffee mills is the foundation of Peugeot's grinding legacy. The case-hardened steel mechanism efficiently cracks and grinds coffee beans to the desired consistency:from espresso fine to coffee- press coarse. For best results, hold mill and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only To adjust the Grind on manual mills not equipped with u'Select, turn the adjustment nut located on the top of the mill. - clockwise to obtain a finer grind - counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind Electric mills permit single-handed use, leaving you free to cook at the same time. Just press the button to start grinding. To adjust the grind on an electric mill, turn the thumbwheel grind adjustment (found below the grinding mechanism on electric mills that are not equipped with the u'Select system). - Clockwise to obtain a finer grind, - Counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind. Classic Electric Salt Mills (not fitted with the u'Select grind adjustment system) are pre-set to medium and cannot be adjusted.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. <strong>About Nautilus</strong><br> Nautilus, Inc. is a pure fitness company that provides the tools and education necessary to help people achieve a fit and healthy lifestyle.

COL description VAL "This is a Cyber Hobby 1/72 Scale assembly and painting required plastic model kit of the SB2C Helldiver, a World War II era carrier-based dive bomber aircraft operated by the United States Navy. Model kit features: engraved panel lines, fully appointed cockpit and gunner/radio operator's station, bomb bay with bombs, twin-row radial engine, new tool single-piece 4-blade prop, individually molded control surfaces, optional position slats and flaps, choice of folded or extended wings, well detailed optional position landing gear, optional position bomb bay doors, optional configuration rear gun stowage fairing, segmented canopy and photo-etch parts (seatbelts and non-perforated dive brake exterior surfaces). Decals and painting guide for 3 US Navy aircraft during 1944: 'White 107' of VB-7 onboard USS Hancock; 'White 22' of VB-7 onboard USS Hancock and 'White 38' of VB-80 onboard USS Ticonderoga. The SB2C Helldiver was developed to replace the Douglas SBD Dauntless, then the primary carrier-based dive bomber in U.S. Navy service. The SB2C Helldiver was a large aircraft capable of carrying a wide variety of ordnances. The SB2C features an internal bomb bay and can operate from the latest aircraft carriers of the time. The bulky size and appearance coupled with early design problems made the Curtiss SB2C unpopular with both pilots and ground crews when the type first entered squadron service. The Helldiver was given unflattering nicknames such as the "Big-Tailed Beast", "Two-Cee", and "Son-of-a-Bitch 2nd Class". Design problems with the Helldiver were largely solved by the time the SB2C-4 variant made its debut and pilots and crew begun to appreciate the added speed, range, and bomb load offered by the SB2C. More than 7,000 SB2C Helldivers rolled out of production lines, and the type remained in service until the end of the war. Cyber-Hobby previously produced its first ever 1/72 scale model kit in its Golden Wings series, a Curtiss SB2C-4 Helldiver. The Helldiver was a carrier-based dive-bomber widely used by the US Navy (USN) during WWII. The twin-seat SB2C was roundly criticized for its handling characteristics, range and reliability, but nevertheless it achieved good results in combat after improvements were made during the course of production. It was in the thick of such battles as Rabaul, the Marianas, the Philippines, Taiwan, Iwo Jima, the Ryuku Islands and Okinawa. One of its strengths was the ability to carry a significant amount of munitions, plus it had an internal bomb bay. Some 7,140 Helldivers were manufactured in total. However, Cyber-Hobby is now pleased to be offering a slightly earlier variant of the Helldiver, an SB2C-3. To improve performance, this type had received a 1,900hp R-2600-20 engine and a four-bladed propeller. Some 1,112 SB2C-3 Helldivers were produced by Curtiss. Of course, this is just the second 1/72 scale kit in Cyber-Hobbys refined Wing-Tech series. The SB2C-3 employs high-tech innovations and widely uses slide molds to enable excellent levels of detail and easy construction. Panel lines are sharply etched into the plastic, and a bomb payload is on offer too. Furthermore, as a carrier-based aircraft, modelers can choose to show the wings folded or extended according to their preference, plus the landing gear can be displayed either lowered or raised. Brand new dive flaps were created in photo-etched metal to achieve the correct scale thickness. The cockpit is fully detailed as well. The Helldiver was the last dive-bomber operated by the USN and now, thanks to Cyber-Hobby, modelers can get a slice of Pacific war action."	COL description VAL "Emergency alert to all units!

COL description VAL " <strong>Wusthof Gourmet Steak Knife Set - 7pc</strong> In its seventh-generation of family ownership, W&uuml;sthof has been making some of the finest kitchen cutlery in the world since 1814. The Gourmet line features precision stainless-steel blades that resist stains and rust and hold an exceedingly sharp edge.<br />&nbsp; <strong>Features:</strong> From sirloin steaks to lamb shanks to turkey cutlets, this set of six steak knives delicately cuts whatever you're serving into bite-size pieces. Plus, the included six-slot oak block keeps the set within reach on the countertop. Part of Wsthof's Gourmet series of knives, these steak knives are a less expensive version of the manufacturer's Classic series of cutlery. Although the blades are still made of high-carbon steel with a stain-resistant alloy, the difference is that they are made of a thinner quality metal and are cut by a precision laser instead of by hand. The blades still have an ideal shape as they are ground and polished by computer to ensure perfect tapering from tip to bolster. Full tangs extend through the synthetic traditional-style handles, which are triple-riveted for strength. These knives are dishwasher-safe but hand washing is recommended to preserve the edges on the blades. The Gourmet series is an excellent alternative for those who want to own quality Wsthof cutlery but are on a budget. <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>"	0

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you.

Different geographies have different tap water conditions with different pH levels, while fish require a specific pH level to thrive. A pH of 7.0 is ideal when keeping a community aquarium containing a variety of tropical fish. Goldfish and livebearers prefer a pH of 7.5. Many Amazonian fish, like angelfish and neon tetras, prefer a pH of 6.5 to 6.8. Mollies and swordtails thrive at pH 7.2 to 7.5. API pH UP Freshwater Aquarium Water pH Raising Solution raises aquarium pH in freshwater aquariums to desired level. Safe for fish and plants.

Their Trident logo is a representation of these principles, a symbol of form, function, and uncompromising quality. Today, Wusthof stands firm behind a strong line of products, including an assortment of more than 350 forged knives, as well as cutting boards, knife blocks, kitchen tools, and scissors, all of which are produced by dedicated workers at state-of-the-art facilities in Solingen, Germany.

But it also means they are perfectly shaped and fit handles  seamlessly. And the blades' high-carbon stainless steel is identical to  that of W&#xFC;sthof's premium knives, only thinner. This knife has a blade  with large serrations (or scallops) for slicing through crusty bread,  roasts, hams, and even soft-skinned vegetables and fruits like  tomatoes. The knife is dishwasher-safe, but hand washing is recommended  to protect its edge. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "Craftsmanship has been a tradition at Wusthof for over 190 years.

As a bread knife, the reversed scalloped edge provides a gentle cut that allows you to cut thinner slices. As a pastry knife, you can cut thin layers of cake cleanly.

The Big Buddy is backed by a limited lifetime warranty. <strong>About Planet Bike</strong><br> In November of 1996, Planet Bike was founded in Madison, Wisconsin. In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists.

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. "	1

COL description VAL "Live green- be green. Out of the woods of Oregon is proud of our green heritage. Long before it was fashionable, we were concerned with conserving our resources and caring for our environment. Our wood products are made in Eugene, Oregon using Oregon red alder. Red alder is a sustainable hardwood that flourishes in the lush climate of the coastal pacific northwest. Red alder is re-planted as it is harvested ensuring the sustainability of this beautiful resource for decades to come. Of equal importance to us, is the wise use of the wood. Much of our wood comes from local furniture manufacturers because we are able to use their short and narrow pieces (fall down) to create many of our products. Short boards, not long enough for their use, are used to make our cutting and serving boards. Very narrow pieces of wood are used to make our spice racks and push pulls. We even use our saw dust to heat many of our buildings. We offer an extensive line of cutting boards for basic kitchen use as well as a wide assortment of specialty boards great for serving dips, pate's, cheeses, and oils. We are proud to be wood workers in Eugene, Oregon and we hope you will enjoy using our products as much as we enjoy making them."

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM "tent cities" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, Eurekas new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition. For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Womens Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian. <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

Made with premium grade, Hydra-Shield, 100% cotton duck canvas. The tight weave and silicone finish make the canvas watertight yet breathable, minimizing condensation and mugginess. Go ahead and touch the inside walls during a downpourthis canvas will not wick water. The Flex-Bow frame has tempered, spring steel rods that keep the tent taut, and robust 1-inch steel tube poles that will hold up to fierce winds. The floor is a seamless, heavy-duty, puncture resistant, 16 oz vinyl that keeps water out. Easy, one-person setup takes only a few minutes after you have it staked out. The steep walls and 66 high ceiling provide a roomy interior with stand-up, walk-around comfort. Large front and back doors with top rated #10 YKK zippers give convenient access. Four windows, and two vents allow ample air flow. Windows and vents have no-see-um screen mesh, keeping out the smallest bugs. A customizable gear loft and organizer system offer plenty of places to stow gear. A large awning provides shade and a covered entry. The handy strap-and-cinch storage bag means no cramming a tent into an undersized bag. Hefty 12-inch steel stakes included. Whether you're heading to the campground with the family or the elk camp with your hunting buddies, the rugged, all-season Kodiak Canvas Flex-Bow eight-person tent is well suited to the occasion. The Flex-Bow tent is made of a superior, marine-grade, 100-percent cotton duck Hydra-Shield canvas. The custom-woven, treated canvas is ideal for tents, as the double-fill design is strong and durable, while the silicone, dry-finish treatment is watertight, breathable, and durable. As a result, campers will stay comfortable and dry even in a downpour. Unlike synthetic fabrics or canvas with a paraffin- or oil-based treatment, Kodiak's canvas allows water vapor to escape, minimizing condensation, humidity, and mugginess. Plus, you'll rarely--if ever--have to retreat Kodiak canvas. The Flex-Bow frame is every bit as strong, with 1-inch galvanized steel tubing and 3/8-inch Flex-Bow spring steel rods keeping the tent taut at all times. To further improve ventilation, the tent includes two funnel-flow vents that circulate air and assist with temperature management. And campers won't feel claustrophobic thanks to the tent's spacious 6-foot 6-inch ceiling height, two large D-shaped doors (front and back), and four large windows, all covered with no-see-um mesh. Other details include a 16-ounce, polyester-reinforced vinyl floor; a large 84-by-78-inch awning; a customizable gear loft and organizer pockets; and a handy strap-and-cinch storage bag. The Flex-Bow, which sets up easily with one person, is designed for year-round use, but isn't suitable for extreme winter mountaineering or heavy snow accumulations. <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="300"> <tbody><tr><td><img align="top" border="0" height="214" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/detail-pages/B001NZWQ1C-1.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The Flex-Bow's spacious footprint sleeps up to 8 people.</strong></em></small></td></tr></tbody></table> <b>Specifications</b><br> <ul> <li>Capacity: 8 people <li>Ceiling material: 10-ounce Hydra-Shield canvas <li>Wall material: 8.5-ounce Hydra-Shield canvas <li>Floor material: 16-ounce polyester-reinforced vinyl with welded seams <li>Frame: 1-inch galvanized steel tubing <li>Rods: 3/8-inch solid spring steel Flex-Bow rods <li>Tent dimensions: 10 by 14 feet <li>Ceiling height: 6 feet 6 inches <li>Pack weight: 79 pounds (includes stakes weighing 6.5 pounds total) <li>Pack size: 30 by 16 inches, with pole bundle measuring 48 inches long and 5.5 inches in diameter <li>Warranty: Limited lifetime warranty </ul> <b>About Kodiak Canvas</b><br> Born in the ruggedness of the Rockies, Kodiak Canvas has quickly earned a reputation for making tough, long-lasting tents ideal for almost any camping scenario.

COL description VAL "The Messermeister Meridian Elit knife collection defines tradition with a triple rivet, full-exposed tang handle. These knives are one-piece, hot-drop hammer forged from a single billet of the finest German stainless steel alloy and fitted with the most durable industrial strength, ergonomic handle in the world. Meridian Elit knives are handcrafted and polished one at a time using the same techniques that have been the hallmark of fine Solingen-made cutlery that have stood the test of time. Meridian Elit knives are the authentically superior, forged and triple-riveted knives manufactured in Solingen, Germany.Crafted from 3rd generation craftsmen in the historical cutlery city of Solingen, Germany.The Messermeister Meridian Elit 8" Carving Knife, has a narrow spear-point, fine-edge blade that is used for small to medium carving chores. It separates meat from the bone and slices it into thin serving portions. This knife's narrow, thin blade makes any carving job a breeze. The 8-inch blade, long enough for most slicing tasks, neatly carves slices--thick or thin--from roast beef, ham, and turkey. One of Messermeister's top-of-the-line Elite knives, which are distinguished from the company's first-rate San Moritz knives by a three-step hand sharpening process blades undergo and classic three-rivet, full-tang, seamless polymer handles, the knife is forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel. The blade has a shortened bolster so it's sharp from tip to heel and a cook's forefinger rests comfortably on it. Made in Germany, the knife comes in a padded gift box. To keep the blade sharp, it's best to hand wash this knife in soapy water. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "This Messermeister Carving Set consists of a Meridian Elite 8" Kullenschliff Carving Knife (E/3688-8K) and a Park Plaza 7" Straight Carving Fork (8012-7) that is presented in a gift box."	1

COL description VAL "The U.S.S. Constitution, a three-mast frigate, is the world's oldest commissioned warship. Built primarily with dense southern live oak, its hull was 21 inches thick in an era when 18 inches was common. Paul revere forged the copper spikes and bolts that held the planks in place. The 204-foot-long ship was first put to sea in 1798 and its most famous era of naval warfare was the war of 1812 against Britain, when it captured numerous merchant ships and defeated five warships, including the H.M.S. Guerriere. It was during the ferocious battle with the Guerriere that British seamen, astonished at how their cannonballs were bouncing off the constitution's hull, cried out, "sir, her sides are made from iron." Hence, the nickname, "old ironsides." The constitution today is a national landmark and is currently docked in Boston.This Is museum-quality, fully assembled edition of the famous USS constitution "old ironside". It is part of an exclusive edition where the hull is laser cut with a unique serial number. The model is 100% hand built from scratch using "plank on frame" construction method. Our master craftsmen have spent more than 100 hours to finish it. One bold feature that makes this model standout is the art of wood use.

COL description VAL "Described by General Eisenhower as one of the four weapons that helped the Allies to win the Second World War, the Douglas DC3 and its military variant the C-47 Sky train (Dakota in RAF service) has since gone on to be an instantly recognizable symbol of both air travel and the liberation of occupied lands that so characterized the Second World War. Continuing to serve even today in both modernized and original formats the DC3/C-47 is now seen as a pioneer of air travel. The Willys Jeep, officially designated Truck, -ton, 4x4, is the best known of all the American vehicles of the Second World War. Originally intended to be a command and reconnaissance car, it became the most versatile of all vehicles. Able to be armed with machine guns and to tow small artillery pieces, the Jeep was essential to the Allied war effort."	0

The set also includes two stick shuttles and enough purple and mauve yarn to weave a 6-by-36-inch piece of fabric. Eager weavers can get started right away with this easy-to-use set, but it's a good idea for kids to spend some time with the guidebook beforehand to practice the more complex tasks. Scarves, place mats, blankets, and more can be fashioned with the kit, though many projects require some sewing to finish. The Easy Weaver certainly deserves its Parents' Choice Award and Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Best Toy Award. <I>--Rob Lightner</I>"	COL description VAL "Harrisville Designs peg Loom is a wonderful, affordable way to discover the excitement of real tapestry weaving.

Then, using the long, plastic needle and brightly colored yarn provided, they weave the "weft"--the filling that goes over and under the string--creating designs and holding the piece together. In addition to a sense of accomplishment, children get the chance to practice math and fine-motor skills. They can use this 7.5-by-10-inch loom to create wall hangings, doll blankets, coasters, bookmarks, and more. Winner of the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio's Gold Seal Award. <i>--Joan DeClaire</i>"	1

The game pieces have been modeled after the main characters from the film: Manny and Ellie (both mammoths), Diego the saber-toothed tiger, and Sid the sloth. The figures are detailed, colorful, and convincing -- certain to charm fans of the movie.<P> Players begin by arranging 24 tiles in a six by four grid at the center of the board. Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play. If they're struggling with the written instructions, they can watch the easy-to-follow video tutorial on the DVD. <P> <b>Interactive DVD Keeps Game Exciting </b><br> The entire game is played alongside the interactive DVD. With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers. For this reason, it's recommended for ages 6 and up.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, game board, 24 double-sided board tiles, 5 game movers, instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL description VAL "''How much do you really know about the natural world?

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center.

COL description VAL "FOUR STAR is the top-selling knife series of ZWILLING J.A. Henckels worldwide. Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 5-inch blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a wide point. The serrated edge is perfect for cutting and slicing soft products that have a firm skin, as this type of blade penetrates more easily than one with a smooth edge. This medium-size knife makes a handy and versatile kitchen tool for cooks of any ilk. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A.

It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life.

These fun fish have the unique ability to absorb light and then re-emit it, creating the perception that they are glowing. GloFish were originally bred to help scientists in detecting environmental pollutants. By adding a naturally derived fluorescence gene to the fish, scientists hoped to quickly and easily determine when a waterway was contaminated. Scientists soon realized the publics interest in sharing the benefits of this research and GloFish were officially brought into the marketplace. GloFish acquire their fluorescent color via a fluorescent protein gene that they inherit from their parents and pass on to their offspring through traditional breeding. Because of this, each line of GloFish originates from a single fish. For example, all Starfish Red Danios are descended from a single red fluorescent zebrafish. GloFish are available in 3 species: GloFish Danio, GloFish Barb, and GloFish Tetra. Aside from their brighter disposition, each species is identical to their non-fluorescent counterparts. This includes everything from general care and temperature preferences, to growth and nutritional needs. GloFish come in six stunning fluorescent colors including Starfire Red, Sunburst Orange, Electric Green, Cosmic Blue, Galactic Purple, and Moonrise Pink. GloFish understands that the enormous potential of genetic technology carries with it an important responsibility. To help ensure the appropriate use of this technology, GloFish commits to the following guiding ethical principles: To keep your GloFish vibrant, healthy, and thriving, it is important to provide quality nutrition and optimal water conditions. For this reason, GloFish has created a line of products specifically formulated to help GloFish thrive. GloFish <a href="/dp/B00JN9HZBG">Special Flake Food</a> is a proprietary formula that maximizes brightness and is optimized for GloFish fluorescent fish. This balanced diet features a colorful 4-flake blend that looks great under GloFish Blue LED lights and contains customized amino acids that make GloFish brighter.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

COL description VAL "We love the K&H Outdoor Kitty House. It is roomy, has the best heater on the market, but it has huge openings and wind blows right through it. We could not stand to see kittyies all over the world go through another cold night, so we took our skills and expertise building cat doors for our Feline Furniture Feral Cat houses sold on Amazon and we are making doors for the K&H Heated and un heated Kitty House. Our doors fit all current models and most of the old ones too. Our doors are based upon years of trial an error and what works for the cats. We know it has to keep the wind and cold out but kitty needs to be able to get into it. So we made it 7 x 10.5 inches. This covers the door openings very generously so no wind gets in. We added 1/2" thick insulation/foam to the back of the door so when it closes it seals closed, but still leaves room for kitty to enter. We have made 1000' of these doors on our sets and have never had a client tell us kitty can't get in. Once they know how warm it is inside (especially after we added the doors) kitty will make his way in somehow some way. Your doors are install easy. You need a drill or ice pick to make it happen. Just line up the holes we have made on the door and drill through your K&H Outoor Kitty House. Add the two clips to keep the door in place and you are done. We have also included a velcro strip. Affix that to the top of the shelter with a staple and then lift your doors up and you will see the door magically stays open. Perfect for introduction or skittish kittys that need to be able to see out. Start with both doors open and then close the back one after kitty uses it. Watch and make sure kitty can figure out how to get in and stay warm. If not adjust the door by pulling in one direction so it cocks the door open a bit for kitty to enter. The world will be a warmer place once you install your doors on your K&H Outdoor Kitty House"	COL description VAL "<br>Faithful reproduction as a decoration for your aquarium."	0

One side is flat while the other is angled for the comfort of left handed people. The ice hardened, convex edge can hold a sharp edge for a long time. It has an ergonomic handle with a dimple pattern making it comfortable and slip resistant, useful for repetitive slicing. The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. Preparing sashimi or sushi is made effortless with the long flat blade that makes precision cutting easier. 10" L"	COL description VAL "GLOBAL has razorsharp straight edge sharpened by hand at a 15% angle. Thinner blades for lighter weight giving you more agility with less fatigue. Perfect balance using a weighted hollow handle. No bolster design allowing for full edge use and full-blade sharpening. All stainless steel construction with slip free handle. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges are also ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 10-inch Sashimi slicer is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. And unlike the traditional one-sided sharpened Sashimi knives, this two-side knife, which is ideal for thinly slicing fish and sushi rolls, can be used for both right and left handed chefs. Global also did away with bolsters on its original knives to reduce the weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as the blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between the blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges, and they carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <i>--Fred Brack</i>"	1

With the delicate blooms in full flower, people from every walk of life gather to pay tribute to the lovely array of color on display. The Sakura Small Ceramic Pet Cremation Urn honors a beloved part of the family with its soft forms and gentle curves, reminiscent of the Cherry Trees in bloom. These small pet urns for ashes are loving memorials to a cherished friend that shared in the joys and the trials, gave unconditionally and loved without ceasing. Often chosen as pet urns for small dogs or a pet urn for cats, the elegance of their design and the brilliance of their colors act as reminders of the precious time spent with a cherished member of the family. Ceramics are made by combining earthenware ingredients, such as clay and powders, with water and molding them into desired forms. Often covered in a waterproof glaze, ceramic pottery is constructed in differing ways. Most often thrown on a potters wheel, it can also be hand molded into varied shapes and then fired in a kiln, first to harden the clay into pottery, then to set the glaze and bring out its vibrant colors. Glazes, only after firing, become the spectacular hues seen on each finished product.<br><br> Artisans train for years to learn the techniques that successfully bring beautiful ceramic pieces into being. With its distinguished and long history, ceramic has enjoyed a development that has shaped it into the expertly crafted material used today. The techniques employed in its use are direct descendants of those invented thousands of years ago, and its evolution has given us the beauty and expert workmanship we see now. Ceramic urns for ashes and cremation pottery are particularly suited to house cremation ashes and are durable and beautiful memorials to a loved one.

Vectra 3D uses a three pronged approach to keep your pet safe from disease carrying agents by utilizing Dinotefuran, Permethrin and Pyriproxyfen. The Dinotefuran is an insecticide that functions by causing continuous stimulation of the nervous system of insects upon first contact. This stimulation leads to tremors and quick deaths in insects as they land on your dog. Permethrin is an adulticide and works to repel vectors, such as mosquitoes, ticks and sand flies by causing them to lose control of their nervous system. Lastly, Pyripoxyfen, an insect growth regulator, works to prevent development of fleas in their early stages. This keeps them as eggs, larvae and pupae until the other active ingredients functionally decimate them. Vectra 3D has been clinically shown to provide fastacting protection against multiple pests lasting up to one month. In addition to repelling mosquitoes, ticks, and sand flies, Vectra 3D repels and kills fleas, lice, and mites quickly and effectively. In fact, it has been shown to reduce the number of ticks in only 24hours and begins killing fleas within the first two hours of use. Vectra 3D remains effective after bathing and it can be used on dogs and puppies older than 7 weeks. Vectra 3D comes in 4 dosing sizes based on your dogss body weight. The product is available for all weights in packs of 3doses and packs of 6doses. Vectra 3D Green for Dogs Puppies is intended for dogs between 2.5 and 20 pounds and this particular package comes with 3 doses. For heavier dogs, use Vectra 3D Blue, Vectra 3D Purple, or Vecra 3D Red. Vectra 3D is also available for Cats and Kittens. Please read the application instructions thoroughly before applying Vectra 3D to your pets. Key Features: Kills fleas, ticks, sand flies, mosquitoes, lice and mites on contact before they can bite Repels pests for full month per dose Comes in Four varieties depending on dog weight: Teal for dogs 1"	0

With a patented reversible blade for sharp or blunt processing, and two speeds of operation, it is well equipped to handle a variety of jobs. <P>Though it has a high-speed motor and durable stainless-steel motor shaft, keep in mind that the Mini-Mate is designed for small amounts of food: 2 tablespoons is the maximum recommended for one batch, and food pieces should be no larger than 1/2 inch. Purchase it to complement, not replace, a larger, full-function food processor. An instruction book that accompanies the processor details how to process many common foods and troubleshoot problems so you know how to best use and care for your Mini Mate. <P>Cleanup and completion of small jobs is quicker and more efficient because of the small size, though the many parts of the Mini Mate require disassembly, careful cleaning, and reassembly, which does add to total cleaning time. If you don't have the time or the patience for smaller detail-oriented prep jobs, Mini Mate is a great kitchen aid. <I>--Emily Wolf</I>"	COL description VAL "DLC1  Features: -Powerful chopper/grinder.-White Base.-21-ounce work bowl.-2 speeds for precision processing.-Patented reversible blade.-Dishwasher-safe parts.-Stainless steel blade with sharp and blunt edges.-Spatula.-Instruction/Recipe Book.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>"	1

Wusthof uses a special blend of German steel through out the whole length of the knife. The ingredients of this steel are proudly etched on each blade.

Motion-activated lights are convenient and energy efficient, but they can be a little bulky and awkward to look at-in the driveway is fine, but you wouldn't want to put one on your porch. Unless it's one of Heath Zenith's porch lights, that is. These products give you the best of both worlds, combining motion-activation and traditional outdoor-light design. The SL-4192 is a six-sided wall-mount lantern that includes a hidden motion-sensing device that detects movement in a 180-degree radius up to a distance of 30 feet. You can set the light timer to one, five, or ten minutes, and the sensor itself may be adjusted to give you more or less sensitivity (so it doesn't light up every time a car drives by). The weather-resistant aluminum construction means it's going to look good for a while, too. This model also features "Dual Brite" lighting, which means you can use it for low-level accent lighting in addition to the full-light effect you get with motion-activation. An included timer allows you to set low-light mode for three hours, six hours, or dusk to dawn (an automatic photocell deactivates the unit in daylight). You can also turn the light on and off at will via the manual override that mounts to an existing indoor switch. If you're looking to save a little money on outdoor lighting by installing a motion-detector, this is a great option that won't look out of place.

The collar adjusts to fit pets large to small and is extremely lightweight, quickly teaching pets to stay in the boundaries designated by the radio fence while offering optimal freedom and comfort.

The Winning Moves Deluxe Pit Card Game is a hilariously frenzied game of commodities that's sure to provide hours of fun and laughter. Shout your deal and trade your cards to "corner" the market; be the first to get all the cards of one product, ring the bell and win the hand. Looking for a sure winner in the hot commodities market? Pit, the fast-paced card game from Parker Brothers, has been a bullish performer since its introduction way back in 1904. With all the ups and downs, desperate deals, and nonstop action of an actual trading floor, this lively game offers great fun without risking the family fortune. The rules are simple: Deal the cards, wait for the opening bell, scream and trade like crazy, be the first to corner a specific market (nine cards of the same suit), and ring the closing bell. Sounds pretty realistic, doesn't it? Once you've got the basic game mastered, try throwing Bull and Bear cards into the mix--that's when things get really interesting!<P> Pit comes neatly boxed with a set of durable game cards, instructions, and a heavy-duty metal bell that's great for slamming. There are rules included for a silent bidding version of the game, but jumping up and down, gesticulating wildly, and shouting yourself hoarse is half the fun. <i>--George Laney</i>"	COL description VAL "It's a trading free  for  all !

There are occasional pitfalls, too: land on the wrong square and you might be stuck in Molasses Swamp until a red card is drawn. With all these enticing, sugarcoated images (and King Kandy plainly visible at path's end), children can't help but be delighted by Candy Land. It's delicious!

Henckels Twin Pro S 6-Inch High Carbon Stainless-Steel Chef's Knife Cooks with small hands find this version of the classic French chef's knife fits. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish Pro S from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Pro S handles are heavier and its knives less weight-forward. The steel used in the Pro S line is identical to that of the Five and Four Star lines. High-tech welding of knives this size and larger combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel.

COL description VAL "This 11 qt. roaster with lid was first introduced in 1979 and helped launch the Chantal brand. It is a symbol of the history and quality of German Enamel Cookware. The natural enamel is stick resistant and contains no chemicals. Enamel ( made of glass ) creates a perfect shield between the metal and food. Perfect for all stovetops, especially magnetic induction. Marinate, Bake, Roast, Broil, Serve, Store. Oven and broiler safe. Limited 10-year warranty. Made in Germany. Lid is safe under broiler but is not for stovetop use. At 16-3/4 inches long, this 11-quart oval pan is roomy enough for a 22-pound turkey or two chickens. Use it also to roast, braise, or stew meats and vegetables. The roaster's lid, which is dimpled to collect and return moisture for self-basting, flips over to become a low-sided roaster itself, a fine size for broiling several big steaks or lots of fish, burgers, or vegetables at once. Both roasting pan and lid have offset handles to fit neatly into oven corners. Chantal's German-manufactured enamel cookware combines utility and beauty in a moderately priced package. Sandwiching a steel core that heats quickly and evenly, the enameled exteriors and interiors are chip- and stick-resistant, nonporous, and won't react with acidic foods. Stainless-steel rims guard against chipping where utensils strike. Colors don't fade but remain beautifully bright. Pots and pans can be used safely on any type of stovetop and in the oven. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "This 42" x 66" Rectangle Tempered Glass Table Top features 1/2" thick glass with a 1" beveled edge.

One player reads the clues, while the others try to guess just what those clues pertain  to.

It is often called the "dream stone" for its ability to help one access the non-physical spirit realms. It is a protective stone, and acts as a ward against negative energies. Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy. Jade can be used as a dream-enhancer by slipping a mala of it under your pillow or inside your pillow case while sleeping. Blessed and Energized with proper Mantras, Puja's and Spiritually activated by SWAMI BUDHIRAJA to give best results.

Calcium and carbonates are essential to all coral growth. If either becomes deficient, coral growth will cease, followed by a rapid decline in coral health. Reef Advantage Calcium also includes magnesium and strontium in amounts proportionate to typical utilization ratios. This allows one to maintain these two important elements while maintaining calcium. If either usage or precipitative loss results in a more rapid loss of either magnesium or strontium, then Reef Advantage Magnesium, Reef Advantage Strontium, or Reef Strontium. may be employed. Unlike limewater (kalkwasser), Reef Advantage Calcium does not have a caustic pH and will not deplete magnesium. Used as directed, it will not deplete alkalinity."

It is often called the "dream stone" for its ability to help one access the non-physical spirit realms. It is a protective stone, and acts as a ward against negative energies. Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork. Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy.

COL description VAL "G-3 Features: -Lightweight, precisely balanced; the handle is hollow and filled with just the right amount of sand to create the perfect balance.-Edge retains razor sharpness exceptionally well; they are ground straight to a point rather than beveled resulting in a dramatically sharper knife which stays sharper longer.-Material of Knife: Blade made of high-tech molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel.-Material of Handle: Stainless-steel handle molded for comfort, dimpled for safe grip.-Cleaning Care: hand-wash. Construction: -Seamless construction for easy cleaning. Dimensions: -Dimensions: 8 1/4'' D. Warranty: -Lifetime limited warranty against defects and breakage. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 8-1/4-inch knife for carving meat and poultry is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "Global heavy weight 8-1/2-inch carving knife This heavy weight Global knife has more heft and a thicker blade than the knives in our classic G series. TPerfect for carving poultry. Loved by professional chefs around the world, Global knives are an excellent choice for the serious home cook. The thin and razor sharp Global blade allows the cook to cleanly slice through foods, preserving the integrity of the ingredient and maximizing its flavor. The majority of Global knives are ground to a straight point rather than the western style of beveling the edge. To balance their knives Global uses a hollow handle that is filled with just the right amount of sand to create the correct balance. The handle has its own unique darkened dimples for a non-slip grip. Global knives have a smooth contour and seamless, all stainless construction that eliminates food and dirt traps. Global knifes are forged in Japan from CROMOVA 18 Stainless Steel, a blend of 18-percent chromium for good stain resistance plus molybdenum and vanadium which gives excellent edge retention."	1

The game begins with players choosing one of four collectible tokens to represent their team. Sculpted out of metal, these tokens have been modeled after the most famous ships in the series: the Enterprise, the Enterprise D, the Defiant, and the Voyager. The game board is collapsible and features two sizes, giving you the option of playing a 15-minute quick game or a 40-minute extended game.<P> Teams advance around the board by answering two types of questions: traditional trivia cards and DVD-based puzzles. The trivia cards, which resemble what you might find in Trivial Pursuit, come in three different categories: green "compendium" questions, red "events" questions, and yellow "culture" questions. They vary in difficulty, and some of the tougher questions are challenging enough to stump even the most seasoned Trekkies.<P> The main attraction, however, is the interactive DVD. Filled with video clips, sound bites and images from the franchise, the DVD challenges players to answer brain-teasing Trek puzzles. With a dozen different puzzle categories, the DVD puts your knowledge of Star Trek to the test. Categories include "Spatial Anomaly," where players must identify a character based on a distorted image, and "Coded Transmission," which challenges players to decrypt a secret message.<P> <b>Something for Everyone -- From Cadets to Fleet Captains</b><br> The DVD has been designed with the fans in mind. You'll see cameos by your favorite characters, watch video clips from classic episodes, and be treated to narration by the Enterprise computer. You'll even do battle with a Romulan Warbird in the tiebreaker mode. All in all, it's a consummate Star Trek experience.<P> With hundreds of questions, Star Trek Scene It? has something for every type of Star Trek fan. It features questions from all six television shows and every motion picture (excluding the most recent 2009 film). The difficulty is also varied enough to keep everyone engaged -- from Star Trek savants to casual fans. Some of the DVD challenges are so riveting that even non-fans will enjoy themselves.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, Flextime game board, Six-sided number die, eight-sided category die, 4 collectible metal tokens, 16 prime directive cards, 175 trivia cards, 4 category reference cards, and instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL description VAL "Attention Trekkies, the ultimate Star Trek trivia game is now available.

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for 19th-century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. The company even fabricated and erected a series of IBM "tent cities" just outside Binghamton, housing thousands of IBM salesmen during the company's annual stockholders meeting, which had outgrown its previous locale. With the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, renowned explorer Sir Edmund Hillary used Eureka's new and innovative Draw-Tite tent--with its practical, freestanding external frame--in a Himalayan expedition to Nepal (Hillary had climbed to the summit of Mt. Everest only six years earlier). In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants during the first all-American Mt. Everest Expedition, where explorers braved fierce 60-plus mph winds and temperatures reached below -20F. Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s, targeting it to backpackers and families. The first to employ the StormShield design, the lightweight, self-supporting backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents in the industry, with sales reaching over 1 million by its 10-year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as companions on other historic expeditions, including the American Women's Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. "	0

Preset this coffeemaker for your desired wake-up time, add coffee beans to the grinder, and in the morning the beans are ground to a medium grind and hot coffee awaits in the glass 12-cup carafe. You can also program the machine to start brewing at the end of a dinner party to avoid having to get up from the table, or to have hot coffee waiting after a brisk winter walk. When making fewer than five cups of coffee, use the 1-to-4-cups setting to improve extraction and heat; coffeemakers without this setting often lack the time to heat up properly, and coffee comes out cooler. A disposable charcoal filter removes chlorine and odors from tap water, improving coffee flavor, and should be changed every few months. Other features include a gold-tone commercial-style filter (or use No. 4 basket-style paper filters); capacity to use preground coffee instead of beans; 30-second Brew Pause, which allows a cup be poured before brewing is complete; and an audible tone to indicate the pot is ready.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. <strong>About Horizon Fitness</strong><br> Horizon is part of Johnson Health Tech, one of the largest manufacturers of fitness equipment in the world.

Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy.

These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag: <strong><font color=CC6600>Buy for Cold</font></strong><br> It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10. Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for "warm" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night. <strong><font color=CC6600>Goose or No Goose?</font></strong><br> The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly <i>and</i> stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use. All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget. <strong><font color=CC6600>Bags for All Shapes</font></strong><br> Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips. <strong><font color=CC6600>Pad Yourself</font></strong><br> No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you.

His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a "no light, no pay" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come."	1

High carbon, no-stain steel bl The thin, long blade of this set's knife makes any fine-slicing job a breeze. The fork's prongs are faceted rather than flat and are exceptionally attractive. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish the Pro S line from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Handles in the Pro S line are heavier and smaller, which makes the knives less weight-forward. The steel used in this line is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines, and the knives are constructed using the same technique. High-tech welding combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, giving the knife its distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Though traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, Henckels claims that the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel.

A pentatonic scale of ancient origin. Where East meets West, Earthsong is a compelling harmony still heard in the music of many styles and cultures. Designed by musician Jeff Kile and integrating a pentatonic (five-note) scale, this phenomenal set of wind chimes impresses with its design and tone. Unlike most wind chimes, Grace Note's chimes are suspended from interior pins placed at the resonant node: this unique suspension design allows the chimes to resonate longer and clearer. The tempered aluminum of the chimes, which hang from an aluminum ring, is a better conductor of sound than brass or bronze. The redwood or cedar striker eliminates harsh overtones and is rot resistant. The chord and notes the chimes play are engraved on the lightweight aluminum wind plate (in this case, it's A, C, D, E, G, A, A min +11). You'll be awed by the classic design and rich tone of these high-quality wind chimes. This is the large size of Grace Note's Earthsong chimes; they also come in small, medium, and extra-large sizes."

COL description VAL "Marie Antoinette would have lost her head over this rug. Our only square rug, the Versailles is perfect beneath outdoor or indoor dining or living room furniture. Classically inspired and available in a rich assortment of colors. Mad Mats are made from 100% recycled plastic, are UV protected and fade-proof, and come with our one-year color guarantee. Because our rugs are handmade, pattern, color and size may vary slightly. Mad Mats' patterns are intricately woven. Multi-colored threads are woven in much the same fashion as real flat weave wool rugs. The result is a warmth and depth of color usually only available to the interior rug market. Most outdoor plastic mats on the market today are made from a combination of virgin polypropylene (PPL) and polystyrene. Mad Mats' plastic is completely different. First, our polypropylene is recycled from used soda bottles, milk bottles, packing, etc. We use only the highest grade of this recycled PPL. Then we combine it with state of the art conditioners and U.V. inhibitors to produce soft, resilient colorfast threads. Our soft tubular threads don't absorb dirt or stains of any kind. Leaves, debris, and food spills are easily rinsed away with a garden hose. They are truly carefree! This is a major advantage of Mad Mats. Most outdoor rugs are a dense weave of spun poly thread. They hold moisture for days which then gets tracked into the house. Grass, food, and dirt seep into the fiber where they remain until the rug is pulled up and washed, dried, and put back in place. YUCK! Mad Mats breathe. They don't trap water so they won't mildew and they won't rot wooden decks. Water goes right through them and evaporates right back out of them. Walking on Mad Mats the morning after a rainy night will leave your feet dry enough to walk right into the house. You put it down and that's it! All Mariachi products are produced under fair trade conditions. We do not work with factories that employ children or produce environmentally harmful waste."

COL description VAL "Most water problems are invisible to the eye. Quickly measure and modify the six aquarium levels that are most important to the health of your freshwater fish with the API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT. To stay healthy and thrive, fish need properly balanced levels of ammonia, pH, high range pH, nitrite and nitrate. These levels can change rapidly and create harmful conditions when fish waste, uneaten food or other organic matter accumulate, or when untreated water is added. If left uncorrected, all of these can be harmful or even fatal to fish, with consequences such as reduction of oxygen, increase in stress and higher risk of disease. The API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT measures these six parameters with scientific accuracy and provides professional results. It comes with four glass test tubes, a holding tray, test tube rack and computer calibrated, laminated color card. Just fill the test tubes, add the test drops and compare results to the color card. Then follow the recommendations on the card if action is required. With API Aquarium products, its easy to keep a beautiful saltwater, freshwater or reef aquarium. For over 50 years, API has been creating innovative, research-driven solutions that make it easier to care for your fish and aquarium.

All Char-Broil TRU-Infrared grills generate a minimum of 65 percent infrared heat, which is evenly spread across the entire cooking surface to cook food -- without drying -- at temperatures that range from simmer to sear. Unlike traditional gas grills that use convective heat (hot air) to cook food, Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared grills limit the hot air flow and use natural, radiant heat to cook food directly without drying. While convective heat destroys food's moisture barrier, infrared heat penetrates it without drying and locks in natural juices and flavors. Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared cooking system virtually eliminates flare-ups while producing very even heat (no hot or cold spots).

Also known by the deceptively benign name of Sand People, the Tusken Raiders are fearsome desert savages who attack with little or no provocation. Their menacing mystique is rendered even more chilling by garments that completely cover them from head to foot, giving them an eerie anonymity. Nomads wrapped in rags, Tusken Raiders can disappear into the desert landscape, only to burst from nowhere brandishing a gaderffii stick or rifle, both of which they use with lethal skill. The last horrifying sight for more than one unfortunate colonist was a Tusken's bizarre mask and the bladed "gaffi" stick swinging down to deliver a deadly blow. Roaming the harsh Jundland Wastes, the Tusken Raiders remain a mysterious peril, as few who encounter them live to tell of their experience."	0

High carbon, no-stain steel bl The thin, long blade of this set's knife makes any fine-slicing job a breeze. The fork's prongs are faceted rather than flat and are exceptionally attractive. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish the Pro S line from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Handles in the Pro S line are heavier and smaller, which makes the knives less weight-forward. The steel used in this line is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines, and the knives are constructed using the same technique. High-tech welding combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, giving the knife its distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Though traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, Henckels claims that the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel. These knives may be placed in the dishwasher, but hand washing is recommended. <I>--Fred Brack</I> <P> <B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/henck-pro-s-block.jpg </td> <td> The J.A.

The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high- carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'.

With its long, narrow blade, this 10-inch knife neatly cuts the biggest ham into thin slices. It also can be used for roasts, poultry, and smoked salmon.

COL description VAL "Fluval Activated Carbon provides many benefits in both fresh and marine water. The high quality carbon provides a large porous area to trap minute particles. Besides providing a small sieve for mechanical trapping of organic wastes, carbon also removes liquid wastes from water. These include urine, dyes or impurities in solution. This action provides sparkling clear water in the aquarium. The large internal surface area also provides numerous points for important bacterial colonies to form and thrive. Carbon should always be removed during medication. It has also been recently noted that carbon will adsorb a large percentage of many of the nutrients in plant fertilizer products. As such, it should be used carefully when keeping live plants. Carbon loses its activity without outward sign. In general, carbon should be replaced on a monthly basis to ensure that active adsorption is maintained. <div class="aplus"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> <h5>Fluval Carbon</h5> Fluval Carbon Filter Media Insert is capable of adsorbing most liquified impurities and dyes present in aquarium water.

It is often called the "dream stone" for its ability to help one access the non-physical spirit realms. It is a protective stone, and acts as a ward against negative energies. Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy. Jade can be used as a dream-enhancer by slipping a mala of it under your pillow or inside your pillow case while sleeping. Blessed and Energized with proper Mantras, Puja's and Spiritually activated by SWAMI BUDHIRAJA to give best results.

If you have trouble maintaining calcium or buffer level, check to see that the salt mix you are using has seawater level of magnesium.

With its ski feet, the Model 1 can be used on many natural terrains to lock into place for accuracy and comfort. Perfect for porous surfaces i.e. mud, clay, soggy grass, etc. Plus the All-Steel construction gives the bipod an almost unbreakable body. The legs have ski feet that extend from 9 inches to 12 inches. Includes (1) One Tactical Universal Bipod Rest Mounting Adapter (150-200) with the axial rotation "Cant" feature. Here at KFS Industries, we believe our products can only be as good as the materials used in the build. While it may cost more to use better materials, the end result is a solid product built to pass down for generations to come. Our competitors use Sheet metal construction, which will allow the bipods to flex and possibly bend with heavier recoiling weapons. Versa-Pod bipod legs are machined from solid billets (aluminum or steel depending on model) and include positive locking notches eliminating movement. With other manufactures, the legs have radial grooves which are lathe turned -simple and cheap. The groove all the way around weakens the entire bipod leg. Our locking notches are individually machined ONLY where the latch locks the leg  more expensive, but much stronger. Solid milled materials eliminate bipod flex, allowing for more consistent precision and a stable platform to shoot from. These are very important points to consider when you are choosing you next bipod. Try the Versa-Pod and you will feel the difference!"

When the water temperature stays above 70 degrees, feed two to four times daily. Warmer temperatures translates to more activity and the need for more food. Always remove all remaining food after the feeding period to avoid over-feeding and the water quality problems associated with this action."

Made from plant extracts and environmentally friendly, MICROBE-LIFT/Parazoryne supports the fishs immune system, driving off the excess parasites. MICROBE-LIFT/Parazoryne is harmless to all nitrifying bacteria and aquatic plants. Naturally controlled by the fishs immune system, parasites are present on most fish in very low levels at all times. When stress levels increase, the ability of the immune system to respond to its requirement to control the natural level of parasites is directly affected. This poor response allows parasites to increase in number, thus causing serious health issues in the host fish. Parasitic infections are characterized by symptoms such as: milky skin, white spots, flashing, heavy breathing and general lethargy. Using chemicals can have a detrimental effect on the bacterial biomass of the tank/pond ecosystem. Please note: as on any healthy fish, there will be some parasites present even after treatment."	0

Because fruits and vegetables "breathe" and require varying amounts of air each container has two vents. The containers' bottoms also have raised grids to elevate produce above its own moisture and prevent spoilage. The vents open and shut with the touch of a finger. High-rate breathers like artichokes and spinach need both vents open. Medium-rate breathers like cabbage and citrus require one open vent. Low-rate breathers like asparagus and berries stay prime with both vents closed. (A chart of various items' needs is included.) The rugged plastic containers are also terrific for ripening tomatoes, apples, pears, and bananas on the counter. The set consists of a rectangular 19-1/2-cup container (14-3/4 inches long, 4-3/4 inches wide, 5 inches high), a rectangular 7-cup container (8-3/4 inches long, 5-3/4 inches wide, 3-1/2 inches high), and a square 4-1/2-cup container (5-3/4 inches square, 3-1/4 inches high).

Special built-in grid lifts food away from condensation. Result? No more yellow broccoli and wasted celery - just delicious, healthy fruits and vegetables for the whole family to enjoy all week long! Say goodbye to soggy lettuce and vegetables with this Fridgesmart storage container. Tupperwares unique ACE (Atmosphere Controlled Environment) venting system allows just the right amount of air into the container by means of two vents on the end of the box. Flip open one or both vents, depending on whats inside--a handy guide gives venting recommendations. For instance, broccoli likes a lot of air, zucchini very little. Raised ridges on the bottom of the container allow condensation to drain away from produce, maintaining freshness. Decorated with a wavy line pattern, the textured lid reduces sliding when another container is stacked on top. While the lid creates a tight seal, some effort is required to remove it. The container and lid are dishwasher-safe but should not be used in a microwave. This storage container measures 9 by 6 by 3-1/2 inches and, like all Tupperware products, carries a lifetime warranty against chipping, cracking, breaking, and peeling. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>"	1

Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who like hefty knives, its original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. This knife, however, is relatively heavy. Thick at the back, the broad, 7-inch blade, designed for butchering fish and chopping hard vegetables, carries enough weight to chop through fish bones. For clean, low-friction cutting, the blade is tapered to an edge on only one side so it's even sharper than other Global knives. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	0

Designed by Wes Helmick in the 15th and 16th century colonial period, when silver tableware was made from silver coins, since our country did not have any silver mines at this time.

If a rustic, hammered look is what you're going for, look no further than Lafayette pattern. With its hammered finish and clean design, the Lafayette pattern is ready for everyday use.

Most stainless steel spoons and forks available in the USA are marked with their steel chemistry; usually 18/0, 18/8, or 18/10. All of these compositions should give you years of use with limited maintenance. If you notice discoloring, or small oxidation marks on your stainless, it can usually be cleaned off with hot soapy water, and a sponge. If that doesn't do the trick, use a good quality stainless polish. Often, a rust spot on your flatware is not the flatware itself, but a dissimilar steel peeler or other item leaning against it in the dishwasher. There are many unique finishes available in our Ginkgo Collection. The most durable and stain resistant is our high gloss mirror finish. A smooth mirror finish leaves little for oxidizing agents to attack. Satin finish breaks the surface of the steel, so it is more prone to staining. However, satin finishes, like on our Norse pattern, can be revitalized simple by scrubbing (in the direction of the grain) with a delicate scrubbing sponge or very fine steel wool. This cleans off the surface, and adds more micro scratches. In metallurgy, stainless steel is defined as a steel alloy with a minimum of 11.5% chromium content by mass. Stainless steel does not stain, corrode or rust as easily as ordinary steel (it "stains less"), but it is not stain-proof. As an example, mayonnaise left on a knife blade in the sink seems to stain the blade a darker color. There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment to which the material will be subjected in its lifetime. Common uses of stainless steel are cutlery and watch straps. Stainless steel differs from carbon steel by amount of chromium present. Carbon steel rusts when exposed to air and moisture. This iron oxide film is active and accelerates corrosion by forming more iron oxide. Stainless steels have sufficient amount of chromium present so that a passive film of chromium oxide forms which prevents further corrosion. Stainless steel's resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and affordability make it an ideal base material for a host of commercial applications. There are over 150 grades of stainless steel, of which fifteen are most common. There are different types of stainless steels: when nickel is added, for instance, the austenite structure of iron is stabilized. This crystal structure makes such steels non-magnetic and less brittle at low temperatures. For greater hardness and strength, carbon is added. When subjected to adequate heat treatment, these steels are used as razor blades, cutlery, flatware, etc. A typical composition of 18% chromium and 8% nickel, commonly known as 18/8 stainless, is often used in flatware. 18/8 has approximately 18% chromium, and from 8-10 percent nickel. The nomenclature 18/8, and 18/10 are sometimes both used to represent the same type steel. 18/0 has 18 percent chromium, and no nickel. This common steel is often used in flatware sets as it combines the stain resistant elements of 18/8 at a lower cost. In recent years the price of nickel has increased by tenfold."	0
