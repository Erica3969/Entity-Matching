By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

Dimensions: -Overall Dimensions: 8.25''H x 6.9''W x 5.2''D. Warranty: -Limited 18-month warranty. The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"Included components of the Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Pulse controlled buttons Why Is This The Perfect Mini Processor For You? The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

Two varieties (i.e. Agave americana var. americana and Agave americana var. expansa) and one cultivar (i.e. Agave americana 'Marginata') have been recorded amongst naturalised populations in Australia.

Mineral elements are extremely important for maintaining good health, top stamina and uninterrupted reproduction. The most important factor, whether in respect to diets or food supplements, is not only the number of individual substances but, above all, their well-balanced and well-matched composition. The mineral elements frequently operate in balanced pairs or in small groups. For example, it is a comparatively well-known fact that the nutritional role of calcium (Ca) is closely related to that of phosphorus (P) and in correlation to one another can prevent rickets and osteomalacia. Because of this, a large proportion of vitamin D3 has been added to NEKTON-MSA to help attune the Ca-P ratio to the requirements of each individual organism. By means of vitamin D3, calcium and phosphorus are better deposited in the animal's bones, thus achieving full benefit of the mineral supply. NEKTON-MSA is primarily for animals during breeding, gestation and lactation. At these times an animal needs more minerals. An increased dose of calcium, for example, reduces the fragility of cage-birds' eggs. In fact an animal suffering from calcium deficiency diseases can be helped back to good health through NEKTON-MSA.\"\tCOL description VAL \"Set A (Two-story Medium Match Accessories) Size:13.8(H)-9.8(D)-13.8(W) inch It includes running wheel,kettle,swings,big wooden house,seesaw,food containers,external bathroom,small broom,molar stone Noting: The acrylic box is assembled.There are a layer of white protection film on the surface.It can be peeled off.Details are available from the instructions for installation.(Included) Box is two story.There is a narrow staircase leading to another hidden entrance in story.Hamster can jump freely and life inside.

Working together, these highly effective media eliminate liquefied impurities, odors and discoloration, while simultaneously removing toxic ammonia, for a clean, healthy aquarium. The Fluval C4 Zeo-Carb Filter Insert was made exclusively for the Fluval C4 Power Filter. <div class=\"aplus\"> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"/> <h3>Fluval Zeo-Carb - 3-Pack</h3> The Fluval C Zeo-Carb Filter Insert combines ammonia removal with ultra-grade carbon purification. Working together, these highly effective media eliminate liquefied impurities, odors and discoloration, while simultaneously removing toxic ammonia, for a clean, healthy aquarium. The Fluval C Zeo-Carb Filter Insert was made exclusively for the Fluval C Power Filter. Engineered to create superior water quality, the Fluval C Power Filter provides extensive 5-stage filtration for outstanding results. The Power Filter is designed to provide maximum surface area and optimum dwell times in all stages of the filtration process. <b>Stage 1 & 2: Mechanical- Poly/Foam Pad</b> Effective mechanical filtration is essential for efficient chemical and biological filtration. The large surface area of the Poly/Foam pad effectively performs two stages of Mechanical filtration. The first stage of porous foam traps large particles and the second stage of dense polyester captures fine debris. <b>Stage 3: Chemical- Activated Carbon Insert</b> The Fluval Activated Carbon Filter Insert contains 100% premium research grade carbon, which provides large amounts of surface area for adsorption of undesirable impurities. The activated carbon filter insert removes unwanted odors, discoloration and impurities, resulting in a crystal clear aquarium. <b>Stage 4: Biological-Bio-Screen</b> An additional hydraulic circuit conveys part of the intake water to the Bio-Screen placed at the top of the Trickle Chamber cover. Fluvals Bio-Screen removes any debris before dripping into the biological chamber. It also ensures that the water pumped to the Trickle Chamber is evenly spread through all areas before it drips on the C-Nodes, which are contained in the chamber. The motion of water dropping slowly through the grids mimics the rain. <b>Stage 5: Biological- C-Nodes</b> The surface of the C-Nodes is made up of a complex pore system that provides optimal living space for beneficial bacteria to thrive and enhance the removal of ammonia and nitrites. The new Star Shape provides a higher filtration surface and more biological power than a traditional cartridge, resulting in a healthy aquarium environment. Sometimes delicate fish and plants require a more gentle water flow. Fluvals patented re-filtration system allows you to control the flow rate without compromising filtration efficiency. When the flow rate is reduced, up to 50% of the water within the filter chamber is re-processed multiple times. More impurities are filtered out, creating a healthier tank with sparkling clean and clear water 1. Filter Cover 2. Filter Case 3. Leveling Device 4. C-Nodes 5. U Tube 6. Telescopic Intake Tube 7.

Activated Carbon Insert: Replace Activated Carbon every 2-4 weeks. Bio-Screen: Replace Bio Screen every 2-3 months. Motor O-Ring: Replace once a year to prevent leaking. For optimal performance it is recommended to clean the impeller cover assembly once a year. The motor should be thoroughly cleaned every three months. Always unplug the Fluval C Power Filter prior to cleaning. Remove cover, filter media and discard water remaining in the filter case. Thoroughly rinse collected debris from the case, impeller cover and impeller assembly using clear lukewarm water. The intake \"U\" tube and extension tube can be cleaned with a filter stem brush to remove any buildup of deposits. When all parts have been cleaned and thoroughly rinsed, reassemble filter and replace any scheduled media. Install the filter once again back on the aquarium making sure that the filter is tipped slightly forward. Then fill the Fluval C filter box with aquarium water. Finally plug the filter into an electrical outlet and the Fluval C Power Filter will self-prime and begin running in a few seconds. The Fluval C Poly Foam Pad Replacement Media, 3-pack, has two sides that combine to provide thorough and effective mechanical filtration. The Fluval C Poly Foam captures large particles of debris on it porous foam side, while the polyester side filters out finer debris and contaminants. The Fluval C Bio-Screen Replacement Media provides massive biological surface area for friendly bacteria to colonize. It also works to block debris and evenly distribute the water flow before it drips into the Power Filter's biological trickle chamber. The Fluval C Activated Carbon Replacement Media, 3-pack, is capable of adsorbing most liquefied impurities and dyes present in aquarium water. The carbon works to remove odors and discoloration from your tank. Fluval C Activated Carbon is suitable for freshwater or marine aquariums, but was exclusively designed for the Fluval C Power Filter.

It is often called the \"dream stone\" for its ability to help one access the non-physical spirit realms. It is a protective stone, and acts as a ward against negative energies. Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy. Jade can be used as a dream-enhancer by slipping a mala of it under your pillow or inside your pillow case while sleeping. THE MALA HAS BEEN HAND KNOTTED (KNOT BETWEEN EACH BEAD). Blessed and Energized with proper Mantras, Pujas and Spiritually activated by SWAMI BUDHIRAJA to give best results.

Elliptical trainer workouts burn a similar number of calories as jogging but without the risk of injury to the back, knees, hips, or ankles. Since your feet never leave the pedals the Stamina Air 1725 Cross Trainer gives a low-impact workout that is easy on your joints. In fact, whereas jogging, jumping rope, aerobics classes, and exercising on a treadmill all require your body to absorb the force of impact, exercising on an elliptical can be compared to running in midair. Because ellipticals are so low impact and easy on the joints, they are also a good choice for older people or for individuals who have old injuries. Up and down buttons adjust the resistance to control the intensity of your workout. The monitor's built-in fingertip pulse sensor tracks your heart rate so you work out within your target heart rate zone. Elliptical trainers mimic the natural path of the foot, the extension of the leg, and the rotation of the hip during walking or running. This motion uses all the leg muscles, giving you a total lower body workout while the dual action arms work your upper body and let you increase or decrease intensity. Work your arms harder to tone and to burn more calories. The foot pedals can be worked in a forward or reverse direction. Resistance may be added as desired to increase the workload on your legs throughout the forward or backward stride to tone thighs and glutes. Combining air resistance and electronically controlled tension, the compact and affordable Stamina Air 1725 elliptical cross trainer provides a cardiovascular workout in your home that also helps shape and tone legs, hips, glutes, and abs. Since your feet never leave the pedals the Stamina Air 1725 Cross Trainer gives a low-impact workout that is easy on your joints. In fact, whereas jogging, jumping rope, aerobics classes, and exercising on a treadmill all require your body to absorb the force of impact, exercising on an elliptical can be compared to running in midair. Because ellipticals are so low impact and easy on the joints, they are also a good choice for older people or for individuals who have old injuries. <table align=right width=350 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/stamina-1725-monitor.jpg\" border=0 align=top width=350 height=333><br><br><small><i><b>The Stamina 1725 exercise monitor.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Double your fun with the new Yankee Coupe towable and lounge from WOW.

Freshly ground coffee: The coffeemaker lets you grind your favorite coffee beans and then automatically puts the grounds into the filter to brew. Fully programmable with an easy to read LCD display for auto-on function and variable heater plate setting. Great Taste: The coffee bar flavor system is the same special brewing system found in commercial coffeemakers. Simply set the number of cups being brewed, for coffee bar flavor at home. Long lasting taste: The Taste KeeperTM lid is designed to minimize oxygen flow into the carafe so coffee stays fresher, longer. Express Coffee: The brew pause feature allows you to pour a cup of coffee before brewing has finished. Consistent Flavor: The 1-4 cup setting allows you to make only a cup or two without altering the flavor of the brew. Variable automatic shutoff, self clean setting with time to clean monitor, grind off function, 1-4 cup setting, large LCD clock, cord storage, and 3-year limited warranty. For coffee that's as fresh as the neighborhood coffee shop, but served at home, try Cuisinart's Automatic Grind and Brew coffeemaker. It makes it easy to enjoy fresh coffee with the utmost convenience--ground whole-bean coffee pours directly into the filter basket at a pre-set time for instant brewing. The maker does all the thinking, with a range of programmable features: set the machine to grind and brew at exactly the right time, predetermine the coffee's temperature, and program the machine to turn off a half-hour later.<P><P>Other features take the guess work out of coffeemaking as well: the flavor setting ensures the optimal amount of water is used for a rich, aromatic taste and no acidity or bitterness, and the large easy-view water window makes sure the right amount of water is added. A self-clean feature lets you know when calcium buildup is interfering with the machine's operation; turn on the self-clean cycle to make quick work of grime. Daily cleaning of the machine is somewhat involved since all individual parts must be removed, so prepare for slightly longer clean up in exchange for time-saving upfront.<P><P>Two additional caveats: The grinder is noisy, as most grinders are, and cannot be turned off midgrind. And the coffee bar is taller than average coffee machines, so make sure you have a spot for it with plenty of below cupboard space. <I>--Emily Wolf</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"The Cuisinart brew Central 12 cup programmable coffeemaker makes a bold statement in any kitchen With a brushed metal finish and elegant tech-industrial design.

The premise hasn't changed at all--two to four players battle it out to make high-scoring words from seven little letters--so choose a dictionary before play begins to avoid ugly confrontations. <i>--Lynne Sampson</i>\"\t1", "label": 1}

It will be the most flavorful and moist chicken you've ever had! Made of quality stainless steel, this roaster begins with a vertical roasting stand that attaches to a large, round drip tray (the stand collapses for easy storage). In the center of the drip tray sits a round dish with cone shaped top. Fill the round dish with herbs, spices, cider, juices or beer; as your chicken rests on the stand, the aromas and flavors from the liquids and herbs pass through the perforations on the cone shaped top, filling the cavity of the bird and adding moisture to the meat as it roasts. Instructions on using the vertical roaster are included. If your last experiment with a vertical roaster led to the bird tipping on its tripod base and landing in the grease pouring out of its cavity, here's a chance to get it right. This Norpro model is versatile enough to serve as a horizontal 13-by-8-1/2-inch rack for roasts. And it easily but sturdily converts to vertical roasting by anchoring up to four hooked pieces to the slats of the flat rack, enabling two birds to roast on this roost, cooking evenly inside and out, with no danger of capon cartwheel. Flipping the bird, so to speak, is a thing of the past--there's no need to pull the rack out of the oven halfway through cooking--and you may as well roast two while you have the heat cranked up (put one in the freezer for next week).

The high quality carbon provides a large porous area to trap minute particles. Besides providing a small sieve for mechanical trapping of organic wastes, carbon also removes liquid wastes from water.

The large internal surface area also provides numerous points for important bacterial colonies to form and thrive. Carbon should always be removed during medication. It has also been recently noted that carbon will adsorb a large percentage of many of the nutrients in plant fertilizer products. As such, it should be used carefully when keeping live plants.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"MacGregor MCBASE55Y Heavy Duty Vinyl Bases - Official 15\" (SET)\"\t0", "label": 0}

Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 10-inch specialty blade on this knife--sometimes called a Granton or Kullenschliff --features a \"\"hollow-ground\"\" edge specially designed for fine cutting duties. Air pockets develop in the hollows along the blade's edge, keeping even the thinnest-sliced meats from clinging to the blade. In addition to its superb meat-slicing abilities, this specialty knife is also great for slicing layer cakes and biscuit bases. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"The gym size E35 features a fluid natural motion provided by a whisper quiet drive system that functions in both forward and reverse motion.

It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve.

Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Sunny Health & Fitness SF-E902 Air Walk Trainer provides an aerobic workout, giving you all the benefits of stretching, walking, running, cross-country, skiing and aerobic dancing without jarring impacts or damaging movements to your body.

It is this balance of German technology and old world hand craftsmanship that is the secret of how each WUSTHOF knife is created. Known the world-over for it's unique and uncompromising quality, Wusthof uses a special blend of German steel through out the whole length of the knife. The ingredients of this steel are proudly etched on each blade. Wusthof not only uses the best materials to make a fine knife, but it is also crucial that each blade is precisely tempered. This tempering allows the knife to hold its edge for an extremely long time, yet still be able to be maintained in your home kitchen with out the need to be sent away for maintenance. Our unique compound angle is not seen in many knives.

The E55 is equipped with a heavy 27-pound flywheel, a high gear ratio not found on most comparable models, and a whisper-quiet drive system. As a result, the trainer delivers an extremely fluid performance and plenty of top-end resistance, helping it function like a much more expensive trainer. The E55's power incline feature, meanwhile, boosts resistance even more while targeting different core muscle groups, adding diversity to your workout. Simply press a button to raise the incline ramp to your preferred position. The ramp angle is fully adjustable from a level plane up to 40 degrees, so you can individually target and work all major lower body muscles. The E55 makes it easy to track your workout progress via the vibrant 7.5-inch blue LCD display, which includes windows for resistance, incline, time, distance, calories burned, pulse, and pace. The console also offers a number of handy amenities, including built-in speakers for listening to your iPod or MP3 player, built-in cooling fans, and a water bottle holder. The E55 comes complete with two heart-rate-controlled workout options, so you can customize the workout specifically to your needs. Throughout your HR workout, the elliptical will display a heart rate zone graph on the console while adjusting the resistance to keep you in your target zone (the trainer includes a wireless chest strap that touts a 99.9 percent accuracy rating). <table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"10\" width=\"298\"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align=\"top\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/sole-e55-right-collage.jpg\" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The E55 offers an adjustable pedals so that you can angle the pedal from heel-to-toe for a comfortable feel.</strong></em></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>The remainder of the time, you can challenge yourself with the six automatic programs or two customizable programs.

This collaboration also produced a revolutionary foot pedal adjustment system not found on any other elliptical brand.

There are currently 161 different Scramble Squares styles of exquisite original art are available on nature, sports, history, culture, geography, science, technology, occupations, hobbies and activities, and more new styles are introduced every six months.

By the time you've become addicted and find yourself unable to solve the thing, you'll realize it's not so much a motto as a warning. Nine colorfully illustrated cardboard 4-by-4-inch squares depict various unfinished images of dalmatians, English cocker spaniels, German shepherds, and Shar-Pei along their edges. The images must be matched and the nine squares arranged in a larger square.

Testing water parameters weekly helps prevent invisible water problems that can be harmful to fish. pH is the measure of acidity of water, on a scale ranging from 0 to 14. A pH of 0 is the most acidic, while a pH of 14 is the most alkaline. Different geographies have different tap water conditions with different pH levels, while fish require a specific pH level to thrive. A pH of 7.0 is ideal when keeping a community aquarium containing a variety of tropical fish. Goldfish and livebearers prefer a pH of 7.5. Many Amazonian fish, like angelfish and neon tetras, prefer a pH of 6.5 to 6.8. Mollies and swordtails thrive at pH 7.2 to 7.5. API pH TEST KIT for freshwater aquariums test a wide range of pH levels from 6.0 to 9.0.

Featuring goofy mole cartoons, electronic lights, bell sounds, and automatic scoring, this toy is just as enticing as the real thing. Kids can choose from four different games and multiple players can join in the fun. Once the three-piece hinged tower is built, kids press the yellow arrow key until they reach the game they want to play, then press the green check mark.  When the game is announced, it's time to grab the mallet and whack that mole! Although the Whac-A-Mole Tower is easy to set up and loads of fun, there are a few minor design flaws. The tower is constructed out of plastic and our testers weren't completely sure it could hold out against relentless mallet pounding. Also, the cardboard sign on the bell comes tumbling to the ground at the slightest touch. But unless your child is a pint-sized version of Thor, the Whac-A-Mole Tower should withstand rough child play. <P>  <b>Play It</b><br> With four different games to choose from, the Whac-A-Mole Tower offers endless mole-whacking amusement. When playing hammer time, kids try to light up all nine zones in the fastest time. In lights out, players send the mole up the tower to turn off the lights and the game ends when all five areas light up at once. Hit 100 is a game of a different sort, where players must score 100 points in the fastest time, and sometimes players have to send the sliding mole all the way to the top. In 0 to 60, kids compete in a head-to-head challenge and try to be the first to score 60 points. All games can be played with more than one player, so no one will be left out of the group. <P>  <b>Testing the Tower</b><br> Our testers decided to give the mole a whack and see if this toy is as fun as it looks. After a couple minutes spent taking out aggression on the bucktooth mole, it became obvious that this is the ideal kid's toy. Not only do the four games ignite friendly competition, simply trying to get the rodent all the way up the tower is a challenge.

Would you stop the sinking of the Titanic? Prevent the assassination of JFK? Kill Hitler before WWII? These are just a few of the possibilities in Chrononauts, the award-winning card game of time travel. To win, you must change history at key points called Linchpins, so that history transforms into the Alternate Reality your character calls home. You can also win by collecting a specific set of Artifacts, such as a live dinosaur, the Mona Lisa, and an unpublished Shakespearean play.

Boasting a heavy 30-pound flywheel, a high gear ratio not found on most comparable models, and a pair of upper body handles, the E95 delivers an extremely smooth workout with plenty of top-end resistance. Users will also appreciate the unique oversize foot pedals, which were designed in collaboration with a leading physical therapist and sports enthusiast. The pedals are not only extra large, but also feature a 2-degree inward slope that reduces the ankle and knee stress that's common in other elliptical machines. The collaboration also produced a revolutionary foot pedal angle adjustment not found on any other elliptical. Taking into account that not everyone walks the same way, Sole engineers made the E95's pedals adjustable to fit the way you walk. This also reduces the likelihood of numb toes and sore Achilles tendons. Workout specifics include 20 resistance levels, 10 total programs (including two custom and two heart-rate programs), and a 20-inch stride length. Perhaps the handiest feature from a user perspective, however, is the easy-to-use electronic console, which integrates a red/green display, a cooling fan, and a water bottle holder. Additional features include stationary handlebars with built-in pulse sensors for monitoring your heart rate; a heart rate chest strap for hands-free pulse monitoring; heavy-duty rails with smooth-riding wheels on the back; and a rear plastic shroud that adds additional stability for aggressive use.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"The gym size E35 features a fluid natural motion provided by a whisper quiet drive system that functions in both forward and reverse motion.

Because this tool's surface contains diamond dust, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. While using this steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings. This steel will also perform better than a steel without diamond dust because it accomplishes the final task of a professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine point while realigning the edge. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it, and this steel's 12-inch rod handles all household knives. The steel carries a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"Even the best knife will lose its initial sharpness during the course of time. Using a sharpening steel each time you use your knives will keep the edge aligned, resulting in a sharper, safer knife. A classic tool that helps get the best from knives, this sharpening steel is a solidly crafted addition to any knife block. Between professional sharpenings, tiny metal fibers bend down on a blade, dulling the surface. The purpose of the sharpening steel is to straighten up those fibers, maintaining the sharpest edge possible for daily use. This model is lightweight, with a flared handle and a tapered edge. It's extremely comfortable and well balanced for experienced users, but beginners may have an easier time with a more substantial weight.

Henckels's 260 years in the cutlery business. It's made from high-grade, rolled stainless steel, produced using Henckels's own Sintermetal Component Technology. This process allows different grades of steel to be combined to form a single integral piece capable of withstanding extreme stress--each part of the knife is made from the grade of steel with the optimum characteristics for that component. The cutting edge features a specially designed serration pattern, ensuring prolonged sharpness without resharpening. The full-length tang (meaning the metal continues all the way through to the end of the handle) gives you a better-balanced and stronger knife. The polypropylene handle with rustproof rivets is nearly indestructible. It's dishwasher-safe, but be careful that the blade doesn't touch other objects; hand washing is recommended to keep steel blades scratch free. <I>--Doree Armstrong</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"Zwilling J.A.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop.

The filament inside an incandescent lamp must be protected so that oxygen does not reach it and cause it to evaporate on contact. Most incandescent lamps are either vacuum-sealed or gas-filled. Incandescent lamp filaments are made of tungsten. Tungsten is a metal that can operate at very high temperatures without evaporating too quickly an resulting in early lamp failure. Incandescent filaments only convert about 10 percent of the energy used into visible light, so it is necessary to use a material that can withstand extremely high temperatures.

Players get more power out of every word and create more play possibilities. Players can build from words crossword puzzle-style or by stacking letters on top of tiles already on the board. The challenge is to make new words each time. For example, \"stack\" becomes \"snack,\" then \"snapshot.\" If it sounds like 3-D Scrabble, there's more to know. Scoring is simpler: each tile earns two points, and each stacked tile earns one. The usual <i>No</i>s apply: no capitalized, hyphenated, or abbreviated words, etc. The set comes with 100 letter tiles, tile racks for two to four players, and a plastic game board. <i>--Lynne Sampson</i>\"\tCOL description VAL \"For over 50 years, Scrabble has turned normal families into shouting, squealing, laughing word enthusiasts! Celebrate the fun with this Deluxe edition. Enhanced gameboard features a turntable base that easily rotates the game to each player. The raised grid keeps the letter tiles in place. Includes gameboard, 100 wood letters, 4 plastic tile racks, drawstring cloth bag, score pad and sand timer. 2-4 players. Ages 8 and up. It's still hard to get a triple word score, the tiles are still made of wood, there's only one \"X\" in the whole box, and family feuds are increasing exponentially. But after 50 years, Scrabble has had a face-lift: a swivel base allows the board to turn so players don't have to work upside down, a plastic grid helps keep tiles in line, and a handy bag stores the letters when they're not in use. The premise hasn't changed at all--two to four players battle it out to make high-scoring words from seven little letters--so choose a dictionary before play begins to avoid ugly confrontations. <i>--Lynne Sampson</i>\"\t1", "label": 1}

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. <strong>About Horizon Fitness</strong><br> Horizon is part of Johnson Health Tech, one of the largest manufacturers of fitness equipment in the world.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Sunny Health & Fitness SF-E902 Air Walk Trainer provides an aerobic workout, giving you all the benefits of stretching, walking, running, cross-country, skiing and aerobic dancing without jarring impacts or damaging movements to your body.

For this reason it is best for absorbing shock loads as is the case when lifting or towing. Nylon lasts four to five times longer than natural fibers because it is resistant to rot, abrasion, mildew, petroleum products, and most chemicals. It is a strong, soft, lightweight cord. Like manila, nylon has good resistance to ultraviolet deterioration from sunlight (referred to as \"UV stability\"). The solid braid construction is very firm, round and tightly woven with a special lock-stitch construction which prevents unraveling when cut or torn. solid braided rope stays round, and stands up especially well to chafing of blocks and pulleys. It doesn't rotate under load. The solid braid construction cannot be spliced.\"\tCOL description VAL \"Solid Braid nylon a is great all purpose rope.

{"ID1": "B000H7QWDK", "ID2": "B002V1QCCG", "Seq": "COL description VAL \"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> Advantage of Freshly Ground Spices </h5> There are many benefits to freshly grinding pepper, salt, herbs and spices for cooking and seasoning. A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity. When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: <b>Grinding mechanism: </b>Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features. <b>Design and appearance: </b>Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table decor. <b>Ease of Use: </b>A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand. Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty. Peugeot's <b>Pepper Grinding Mechanism</b> is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available Peugeot's <b>Salt Crushing Mechanism</b> features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill. Peugeot's <b>Spice Mechanism</b> is made of ceramic, and is specially designed to grind dried spices and flat leafy herbs to release their essential oils. It is particularly effective with dried aromatic herbs such as thyme, parsley, basil, oregano, and herbs de Provence, as well as dried seeds such as cumin. Peugeot's <b>Chili Pepper Mechanism</b> is made of case hardened steel for optimal hardness and resilience. This patented mechanism features a pre-cutting system and dual chamber reservoir. For use with dry, hot chilis such as birds tongue, African devils and Piri Piri. The <b>Nutmeg Shaving Mechanism</b> is made of treated stainless steel which is corrosion resistant, and offers superior edge retention. The Peugeot nutmeg shaver is equipped with a double stainless steel grater blade and a strong claw which enables the whole nutmeg to be very finely shaved, while keeping fingers safe. Intended for use with whole nutmeg nuts. Peugeot's <b>Wet Salt mechanism</b> has been specially designed for wet sea salt: a spiral guides the salt, ensuring that it does not stick together. The mechanism is made of ceramic because wet salt crystals are soft (wear is not an issue) but corrosive. Intended for use with damp sea salts such as Sel de Guerande. The <b>Coffee Grinding Mechanism</b> found in all Peugeot coffee mills is the foundation of Peugeot's grinding legacy. The case-hardened steel mechanism efficiently cracks and grinds coffee beans to the desired consistency:from espresso fine to coffee- press coarse. For best results, hold mill and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only To adjust the Grind on manual mills not equipped with u'Select, turn the adjustment nut located on the top of the mill. - clockwise to obtain a finer grind - counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind Electric mills permit single-handed use, leaving you free to cook at the same time. Just press the button to start grinding. To adjust the grind on an electric mill, turn the thumbwheel grind adjustment (found below the grinding mechanism on electric mills that are not equipped with the u'Select system). - Clockwise to obtain a finer grind, - Counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind. Classic Electric Salt Mills (not fitted with the u'Select grind adjustment system) are pre-set to medium and cannot be adjusted. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Add a little whimsy to your holiday with our Soldier Dog ornaments.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. <strong>About Nautilus</strong><br> Nautilus, Inc. is a pure fitness company that provides the tools and education necessary to help people achieve a fit and healthy lifestyle.

Model kit features: engraved panel lines, fully appointed cockpit and gunner/radio operator's station, bomb bay with bombs, twin-row radial engine, new tool single-piece 4-blade prop, individually molded control surfaces, optional position slats and flaps, choice of folded or extended wings, well detailed optional position landing gear, optional position bomb bay doors, optional configuration rear gun stowage fairing, segmented canopy and photo-etch parts (seatbelts and non-perforated dive brake exterior surfaces). Decals and painting guide for 3 US Navy aircraft during 1944: 'White 107' of VB-7 onboard USS Hancock; 'White 22' of VB-7 onboard USS Hancock and 'White 38' of VB-80 onboard USS Ticonderoga. The SB2C Helldiver was developed to replace the Douglas SBD Dauntless, then the primary carrier-based dive bomber in U.S. Navy service. The SB2C Helldiver was a large aircraft capable of carrying a wide variety of ordnances. The SB2C features an internal bomb bay and can operate from the latest aircraft carriers of the time. The bulky size and appearance coupled with early design problems made the Curtiss SB2C unpopular with both pilots and ground crews when the type first entered squadron service. The Helldiver was given unflattering nicknames such as the \"Big-Tailed Beast\", \"Two-Cee\", and \"Son-of-a-Bitch 2nd Class\". Design problems with the Helldiver were largely solved by the time the SB2C-4 variant made its debut and pilots and crew begun to appreciate the added speed, range, and bomb load offered by the SB2C. More than 7,000 SB2C Helldivers rolled out of production lines, and the type remained in service until the end of the war. Cyber-Hobby previously produced its first ever 1/72 scale model kit in its Golden Wings series, a Curtiss SB2C-4 Helldiver. The Helldiver was a carrier-based dive-bomber widely used by the US Navy (USN) during WWII. The twin-seat SB2C was roundly criticized for its handling characteristics, range and reliability, but nevertheless it achieved good results in combat after improvements were made during the course of production. It was in the thick of such battles as Rabaul, the Marianas, the Philippines, Taiwan, Iwo Jima, the Ryuku Islands and Okinawa. One of its strengths was the ability to carry a significant amount of munitions, plus it had an internal bomb bay. Some 7,140 Helldivers were manufactured in total. However, Cyber-Hobby is now pleased to be offering a slightly earlier variant of the Helldiver, an SB2C-3. To improve performance, this type had received a 1,900hp R-2600-20 engine and a four-bladed propeller. Some 1,112 SB2C-3 Helldivers were produced by Curtiss. Of course, this is just the second 1/72 scale kit in Cyber-Hobbys refined Wing-Tech series. The SB2C-3 employs high-tech innovations and widely uses slide molds to enable excellent levels of detail and easy construction. Panel lines are sharply etched into the plastic, and a bomb payload is on offer too. Furthermore, as a carrier-based aircraft, modelers can choose to show the wings folded or extended according to their preference, plus the landing gear can be displayed either lowered or raised. Brand new dive flaps were created in photo-etched metal to achieve the correct scale thickness. The cockpit is fully detailed as well. The Helldiver was the last dive-bomber operated by the USN and now, thanks to Cyber-Hobby, modelers can get a slice of Pacific war action.\"\tCOL description VAL \"Emergency alert to all units!

Blade is made of high-quality material. Ergonomic handle is triple-riveted for secure grip. Perfect for carving large meats such as turkeys, roasts, or ham. Features a reverse serrated edge. Blade measures 10 inches long. A moderately priced companion to W&#xFC;sthof's renowned Classic  forged knives, this Gourmet Series 10-inch slicing knife has the same  full-tang, three-rivet, virtually indestructible poly handle as Classic  knives. Instead of being forged, however, Gourmet Series blades are cut  from steel sheets by precision lasers. That means they have no  bolsters. But it also means they are perfectly shaped and fit handles  seamlessly. And the blades' high-carbon stainless steel is identical to  that of W&#xFC;sthof's premium knives, only thinner. This knife has a blade  with large serrations (or scallops) for slicing through crusty bread,  roasts, hams, and even soft-skinned vegetables and fruits like  tomatoes. The knife is dishwasher-safe, but hand washing is recommended  to protect its edge. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"Craftsmanship has been a tradition at Wusthof for over 190 years. Quality and precision have always been the standard that we measure our knife by and our Gourmet line of stamped German knives take precision to a new level. Each knife in this line is cut from a piece of steel using a laser beam to make a perfect blade. Imagine having a knife that can do it all. The Wusthof Gourmet super slicer has many different uses. As a bread knife, the reversed scalloped edge provides a gentle cut that allows you to cut thinner slices. As a pastry knife, you can cut thin layers of cake cleanly. As a roast slicer, the gentle edge will cut without the ripping and tearing of the typical serrated style knife.\"\t1", "label": 1}

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM \"tent cities\" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, Eurekas new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition. For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Womens Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian. <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Whether youre headed to the campground with your family, or elk camp with your hunting buddies, this rugged, all-season tent is well suited for the occasion. Made with premium grade, Hydra-Shield, 100% cotton duck canvas. The tight weave and silicone finish make the canvas watertight yet breathable, minimizing condensation and mugginess. Go ahead and touch the inside walls during a downpourthis canvas will not wick water. The Flex-Bow frame has tempered, spring steel rods that keep the tent taut, and robust 1-inch steel tube poles that will hold up to fierce winds. The floor is a seamless, heavy-duty, puncture resistant, 16 oz vinyl that keeps water out. Easy, one-person setup takes only a few minutes after you have it staked out. The steep walls and 66 high ceiling provide a roomy interior with stand-up, walk-around comfort. Large front and back doors with top rated #10 YKK zippers give convenient access. Four windows, and two vents allow ample air flow. Windows and vents have no-see-um screen mesh, keeping out the smallest bugs.

Whether you're heading to the campground with the family or the elk camp with your hunting buddies, the rugged, all-season Kodiak Canvas Flex-Bow eight-person tent is well suited to the occasion. The Flex-Bow tent is made of a superior, marine-grade, 100-percent cotton duck Hydra-Shield canvas. The custom-woven, treated canvas is ideal for tents, as the double-fill design is strong and durable, while the silicone, dry-finish treatment is watertight, breathable, and durable. As a result, campers will stay comfortable and dry even in a downpour. Unlike synthetic fabrics or canvas with a paraffin- or oil-based treatment, Kodiak's canvas allows water vapor to escape, minimizing condensation, humidity, and mugginess. Plus, you'll rarely--if ever--have to retreat Kodiak canvas. The Flex-Bow frame is every bit as strong, with 1-inch galvanized steel tubing and 3/8-inch Flex-Bow spring steel rods keeping the tent taut at all times. To further improve ventilation, the tent includes two funnel-flow vents that circulate air and assist with temperature management. And campers won't feel claustrophobic thanks to the tent's spacious 6-foot 6-inch ceiling height, two large D-shaped doors (front and back), and four large windows, all covered with no-see-um mesh.

The filter is pleated, so it has a remarkable filtering capacity for its compact size. The filter canister mounts directly to the collector housing. Four finger-operated knobs lock the canister in place, so installation and removal is easy and tool free. For further convenience, a top-mounted handle operates a pair of \"hands\" that wipe across the filter pleats and knock off dust buildup. Turning the handle one full revolution per month is all that is required to keep the dust collector operating effectively. What's more, collector (catch) bag capacity for both fabric and plastic bags is an impressive 10 cubic feet, meaning you won't have to worry about frequent bag changes. <b>Powerful and Efficient Dust Collection</b><br>The PM1300 is powered by a 1-3/4-HP, 1-Ph, 115/220V TEFC (totally enclosed fan-cooled) motor for effective air movement. The motor is secured to a mount on the dust collector's base platform, creating a low center of gravity and ensuring easy movement around the shop. Just as efficient as it is powerful, the PM1300 features all-metal duct construction that provides rigidity and maximum air flow. Additionally, dual four-inch dust ports allow for simultaneous collection from two machines. <b>Convenient Remote-Control Operation</b><br>For convenience, the PM1300 comes with a full-function infrared remote control. The remote emits an invisible light-based signal in a 120-degree cone--so you can use it pretty much whenever the dust collector is within your line of sight. To help save on energy costs, a digital timer can be programmed on the remote for up to 99 minutes of continuous operation at the level you choose. The remote can also be used to turn the dust collector on and off. <table cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"75\" align=\"left\"><tr><td><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/content_26/Q1_2010/jet_B001AZNJT8_3-sm.jpg\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\"></td></tr></table><b>Dimensions and Warranty Information</b><br>The PM1300 measures 29.0 x 72.0 x 37.0 inches (WxHxD) and weighs 150 pounds. Because the canister has an overall height of approximately six feet, it's an ideal choice for shops with low ceilings or overhead clearances, especially in comparison to the taller PM1300 Dust Collector with Filter Bag. The PM1300 Dust Collector with Filter Canister is backed by a five-year limited warranty. <b>What's in the Box</b><br>Dust collector with one base; canister filter system; four casters; one motor/fan assembly; one inlet guard; one inlet port with cap; one lower gasket; one connector tube; one control box; one upper gasket; one collector housing; one support bar; two handles; two plats; four socket head cap screws; one remote control with batteries; one manual; and one warranty card.<br clear=\"all\">\"\t0", "label": 0}

The game pieces have been modeled after the main characters from the film: Manny and Ellie (both mammoths), Diego the saber-toothed tiger, and Sid the sloth. The figures are detailed, colorful, and convincing -- certain to charm fans of the movie.<P> Players begin by arranging 24 tiles in a six by four grid at the center of the board. Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play. If they're struggling with the written instructions, they can watch the easy-to-follow video tutorial on the DVD. <P> <b>Interactive DVD Keeps Game Exciting </b><br> The entire game is played alongside the interactive DVD. With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers. For this reason, it's recommended for ages 6 and up.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, game board, 24 double-sided board tiles, 5 game movers, instruction sheet. <br clear=\"all\"> <table cellpadding=\"10\" align=\"center\"> <tr> <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-sm.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><font size=\"1\"><b><em><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;\">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-sm.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><font size=\"1\"><b><em><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;\">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-sm.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><font size=\"1\"><b><em><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;\">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear=\"all\">\"\tCOL description VAL \"''How much do you really know about the natural world?

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 5-inch blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a wide point. The serrated edge is perfect for cutting and slicing soft products that have a firm skin, as this type of blade penetrates more easily than one with a smooth edge. This medium-size knife makes a handy and versatile kitchen tool for cooks of any ilk. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A. Henckels company is not only one of the world's oldest cutlery manufacturers, it's also one of the most well respected, creating best-selling knives guaranteed to last a lifetime. <i>--Kim Harwell</i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> First introduced in 1976, the Four Star Series is one of the world's most popular knife lines.

These fun fish have the unique ability to absorb light and then re-emit it, creating the perception that they are glowing. GloFish were originally bred to help scientists in detecting environmental pollutants. By adding a naturally derived fluorescence gene to the fish, scientists hoped to quickly and easily determine when a waterway was contaminated. Scientists soon realized the publics interest in sharing the benefits of this research and GloFish were officially brought into the marketplace. GloFish acquire their fluorescent color via a fluorescent protein gene that they inherit from their parents and pass on to their offspring through traditional breeding. Because of this, each line of GloFish originates from a single fish. For example, all Starfish Red Danios are descended from a single red fluorescent zebrafish. GloFish are available in 3 species: GloFish Danio, GloFish Barb, and GloFish Tetra. Aside from their brighter disposition, each species is identical to their non-fluorescent counterparts. This includes everything from general care and temperature preferences, to growth and nutritional needs. GloFish come in six stunning fluorescent colors including Starfire Red, Sunburst Orange, Electric Green, Cosmic Blue, Galactic Purple, and Moonrise Pink. GloFish understands that the enormous potential of genetic technology carries with it an important responsibility. To help ensure the appropriate use of this technology, GloFish commits to the following guiding ethical principles: To keep your GloFish vibrant, healthy, and thriving, it is important to provide quality nutrition and optimal water conditions. For this reason, GloFish has created a line of products specifically formulated to help GloFish thrive.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Okuma's Tarvos 1 piece freshwater fishing rods.

It is roomy, has the best heater on the market, but it has huge openings and wind blows right through it. We could not stand to see kittyies all over the world go through another cold night, so we took our skills and expertise building cat doors for our Feline Furniture Feral Cat houses sold on Amazon and we are making doors for the K&H Heated and un heated Kitty House. Our doors fit all current models and most of the old ones too. Our doors are based upon years of trial an error and what works for the cats. We know it has to keep the wind and cold out but kitty needs to be able to get into it. So we made it 7 x 10.5 inches. This covers the door openings very generously so no wind gets in. We added 1/2\" thick insulation/foam to the back of the door so when it closes it seals closed, but still leaves room for kitty to enter. We have made 1000' of these doors on our sets and have never had a client tell us kitty can't get in. Once they know how warm it is inside (especially after we added the doors) kitty will make his way in somehow some way. Your doors are install easy. You need a drill or ice pick to make it happen. Just line up the holes we have made on the door and drill through your K&H Outoor Kitty House. Add the two clips to keep the door in place and you are done. We have also included a velcro strip. Affix that to the top of the shelter with a staple and then lift your doors up and you will see the door magically stays open. Perfect for introduction or skittish kittys that need to be able to see out. Start with both doors open and then close the back one after kitty uses it. Watch and make sure kitty can figure out how to get in and stay warm. If not adjust the door by pulling in one direction so it cocks the door open a bit for kitty to enter.

The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance.

Thinner blades for lighter weight giving you more agility with less fatigue. Perfect balance using a weighted hollow handle. No bolster design allowing for full edge use and full-blade sharpening. All stainless steel construction with slip free handle. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and \"face-ground\" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges are also ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a \"heavyweight\" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 10-inch Sashimi slicer is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. And unlike the traditional one-sided sharpened Sashimi knives, this two-side knife, which is ideal for thinly slicing fish and sushi rolls, can be used for both right and left handed chefs. Global also did away with bolsters on its original knives to reduce the weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as the blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between the blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges, and they carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <i>--Fred Brack</i>\"\t1", "label": 1}

Vectra 3D uses a three pronged approach to keep your pet safe from disease carrying agents by utilizing Dinotefuran, Permethrin and Pyriproxyfen. The Dinotefuran is an insecticide that functions by causing continuous stimulation of the nervous system of insects upon first contact. This stimulation leads to tremors and quick deaths in insects as they land on your dog. Permethrin is an adulticide and works to repel vectors, such as mosquitoes, ticks and sand flies by causing them to lose control of their nervous system. Lastly, Pyripoxyfen, an insect growth regulator, works to prevent development of fleas in their early stages. This keeps them as eggs, larvae and pupae until the other active ingredients functionally decimate them. Vectra 3D has been clinically shown to provide fastacting protection against multiple pests lasting up to one month. In addition to repelling mosquitoes, ticks, and sand flies, Vectra 3D repels and kills fleas, lice, and mites quickly and effectively. In fact, it has been shown to reduce the number of ticks in only 24hours and begins killing fleas within the first two hours of use. Vectra 3D remains effective after bathing and it can be used on dogs and puppies older than 7 weeks. Vectra 3D comes in 4 dosing sizes based on your dogss body weight. The product is available for all weights in packs of 3doses and packs of 6doses.

With a patented reversible blade for sharp or blunt processing, and two speeds of operation, it is well equipped to handle a variety of jobs. <P>Though it has a high-speed motor and durable stainless-steel motor shaft, keep in mind that the Mini-Mate is designed for small amounts of food: 2 tablespoons is the maximum recommended for one batch, and food pieces should be no larger than 1/2 inch. Purchase it to complement, not replace, a larger, full-function food processor. An instruction book that accompanies the processor details how to process many common foods and troubleshoot problems so you know how to best use and care for your Mini Mate. <P>Cleanup and completion of small jobs is quicker and more efficient because of the small size, though the many parts of the Mini Mate require disassembly, careful cleaning, and reassembly, which does add to total cleaning time. If you don't have the time or the patience for smaller detail-oriented prep jobs, Mini Mate is a great kitchen aid. <I>--Emily Wolf</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"DLC1  Features: -Powerful chopper/grinder.-White Base.-21-ounce work bowl.-2 speeds for precision processing.-Patented reversible blade.-Dishwasher-safe parts.-Stainless steel blade with sharp and blunt edges.-Spatula.-Instruction/Recipe Book.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>\"\t1", "label": 1}

Wusthof uses a special blend of German steel through out the whole length of the knife. The ingredients of this steel are proudly etched on each blade. Wusthof not only uses the best materials to make a fine knife, but it is also crucial that each blade is precisely tempered. This tempering allows the knife to hold its edge for an extremely long time, yet still be able to be maintained in your home kitchen with out the need to be sent away for maintenance.

Uses one 100 watt medium base bulb. 18.5\" height x 7\" width x 8.5\" depth. Motion-activated lights are convenient and energy efficient, but they can be a little bulky and awkward to look at-in the driveway is fine, but you wouldn't want to put one on your porch. Unless it's one of Heath Zenith's porch lights, that is. These products give you the best of both worlds, combining motion-activation and traditional outdoor-light design. The SL-4192 is a six-sided wall-mount lantern that includes a hidden motion-sensing device that detects movement in a 180-degree radius up to a distance of 30 feet. You can set the light timer to one, five, or ten minutes, and the sensor itself may be adjusted to give you more or less sensitivity (so it doesn't light up every time a car drives by). The weather-resistant aluminum construction means it's going to look good for a while, too. This model also features \"Dual Brite\" lighting, which means you can use it for low-level accent lighting in addition to the full-light effect you get with motion-activation. An included timer allows you to set low-light mode for three hours, six hours, or dusk to dawn (an automatic photocell deactivates the unit in daylight). You can also turn the light on and off at will via the manual override that mounts to an existing indoor switch. If you're looking to save a little money on outdoor lighting by installing a motion-detector, this is a great option that won't look out of place. Requires one medium-based bulb of up to 100 watts (not included). <I>--Josh Dettweiler</I> <b>What's in the Box</b><br>Lamp housing, motion detector \"\t1", "label": 1}

With all the ups and downs, desperate deals, and nonstop action of an actual trading floor, this lively game offers great fun without risking the family fortune. The rules are simple: Deal the cards, wait for the opening bell, scream and trade like crazy, be the first to corner a specific market (nine cards of the same suit), and ring the closing bell. Sounds pretty realistic, doesn't it? Once you've got the basic game mastered, try throwing Bull and Bear cards into the mix--that's when things get really interesting!<P> Pit comes neatly boxed with a set of durable game cards, instructions, and a heavy-duty metal bell that's great for slamming. There are rules included for a silent bidding version of the game, but jumping up and down, gesticulating wildly, and shouting yourself hoarse is half the fun. <i>--George Laney</i>\"\tCOL description VAL \"It's a trading free  for  all ! Each player tries to corner the market in one commodity, much as it's done in the \"pits\" of actual grain exchanges. The special bell signals the opening and closing of trading.\"\t1", "label": 1}

The steel used in the Pro S line is identical to that of the Five and Four Star lines. High-tech welding of knives this size and larger combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang.

It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork. Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy.

Construction: -Seamless construction for easy cleaning. Dimensions: -Dimensions: 8 1/4'' D. Warranty: -Lifetime limited warranty against defects and breakage. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and \"face-ground\" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a \"heavyweight\" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 8-1/4-inch knife for carving meat and poultry is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"Global heavy weight 8-1/2-inch carving knife This heavy weight Global knife has more heft and a thicker blade than the knives in our classic G series. TPerfect for carving poultry. Loved by professional chefs around the world, Global knives are an excellent choice for the serious home cook. The thin and razor sharp Global blade allows the cook to cleanly slice through foods, preserving the integrity of the ingredient and maximizing its flavor. The majority of Global knives are ground to a straight point rather than the western style of beveling the edge. To balance their knives Global uses a hollow handle that is filled with just the right amount of sand to create the correct balance. The handle has its own unique darkened dimples for a non-slip grip. Global knives have a smooth contour and seamless, all stainless construction that eliminates food and dirt traps. Global knifes are forged in Japan from CROMOVA 18 Stainless Steel, a blend of 18-percent chromium for good stain resistance plus molybdenum and vanadium which gives excellent edge retention.\"\t1", "label": 1}

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for 19th-century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. The company even fabricated and erected a series of IBM \"tent cities\" just outside Binghamton, housing thousands of IBM salesmen during the company's annual stockholders meeting, which had outgrown its previous locale. With the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, renowned explorer Sir Edmund Hillary used Eureka's new and innovative Draw-Tite tent--with its practical, freestanding external frame--in a Himalayan expedition to Nepal (Hillary had climbed to the summit of Mt. Everest only six years earlier). In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants during the first all-American Mt. Everest Expedition, where explorers braved fierce 60-plus mph winds and temperatures reached below -20F. Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s, targeting it to backpackers and families. The first to employ the StormShield design, the lightweight, self-supporting backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents in the industry, with sales reaching over 1 million by its 10-year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as companions on other historic expeditions, including the American Women's Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. \"\t0", "label": 0}

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. <strong>About Horizon Fitness</strong><br> Horizon is part of Johnson Health Tech, one of the largest manufacturers of fitness equipment in the world.

It is often called the \"dream stone\" for its ability to help one access the non-physical spirit realms. It is a protective stone, and acts as a ward against negative energies. Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy.

These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag: <strong><font color=CC6600>Buy for Cold</font></strong><br> It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10. Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for \"warm\" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night. <strong><font color=CC6600>Goose or No Goose?</font></strong><br> The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly <i>and</i> stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use. All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget. <strong><font color=CC6600>Bags for All Shapes</font></strong><br> Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips. <strong><font color=CC6600>Pad Yourself</font></strong><br> No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Sleep comfortablyeven when the temperature drops below freezingwith the Coleman Heritage Big and Tall Sleeping Bag.

His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a \"no light, no pay\" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.\"\t1", "label": 1}

Classic three-rivet handles distinguish the Pro S line from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Handles in the Pro S line are heavier and smaller, which makes the knives less weight-forward. The steel used in this line is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines, and the knives are constructed using the same technique. High-tech welding combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, giving the knife its distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang.

Our only square rug, the Versailles is perfect beneath outdoor or indoor dining or living room furniture. Classically inspired and available in a rich assortment of colors. Mad Mats are made from 100% recycled plastic, are UV protected and fade-proof, and come with our one-year color guarantee. Because our rugs are handmade, pattern, color and size may vary slightly. Mad Mats' patterns are intricately woven. Multi-colored threads are woven in much the same fashion as real flat weave wool rugs. The result is a warmth and depth of color usually only available to the interior rug market. Most outdoor plastic mats on the market today are made from a combination of virgin polypropylene (PPL) and polystyrene. Mad Mats' plastic is completely different. First, our polypropylene is recycled from used soda bottles, milk bottles, packing, etc. We use only the highest grade of this recycled PPL. Then we combine it with state of the art conditioners and U.V. inhibitors to produce soft, resilient colorfast threads. Our soft tubular threads don't absorb dirt or stains of any kind. Leaves, debris, and food spills are easily rinsed away with a garden hose. They are truly carefree! This is a major advantage of Mad Mats. Most outdoor rugs are a dense weave of spun poly thread. They hold moisture for days which then gets tracked into the house. Grass, food, and dirt seep into the fiber where they remain until the rug is pulled up and washed, dried, and put back in place. YUCK! Mad Mats breathe. They don't trap water so they won't mildew and they won't rot wooden decks. Water goes right through them and evaporates right back out of them. Walking on Mad Mats the morning after a rainy night will leave your feet dry enough to walk right into the house. You put it down and that's it!

Quickly measure and modify the six aquarium levels that are most important to the health of your freshwater fish with the API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT. To stay healthy and thrive, fish need properly balanced levels of ammonia, pH, high range pH, nitrite and nitrate. These levels can change rapidly and create harmful conditions when fish waste, uneaten food or other organic matter accumulate, or when untreated water is added. If left uncorrected, all of these can be harmful or even fatal to fish, with consequences such as reduction of oxygen, increase in stress and higher risk of disease. The API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT measures these six parameters with scientific accuracy and provides professional results. It comes with four glass test tubes, a holding tray, test tube rack and computer calibrated, laminated color card. Just fill the test tubes, add the test drops and compare results to the color card. Then follow the recommendations on the card if action is required. With API Aquarium products, its easy to keep a beautiful saltwater, freshwater or reef aquarium.

All Char-Broil TRU-Infrared grills generate a minimum of 65 percent infrared heat, which is evenly spread across the entire cooking surface to cook food -- without drying -- at temperatures that range from simmer to sear. Unlike traditional gas grills that use convective heat (hot air) to cook food, Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared grills limit the hot air flow and use natural, radiant heat to cook food directly without drying. While convective heat destroys food's moisture barrier, infrared heat penetrates it without drying and locks in natural juices and flavors. Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared cooking system virtually eliminates flare-ups while producing very even heat (no hot or cold spots).

High carbon, no-stain steel bl The thin, long blade of this set's knife makes any fine-slicing job a breeze. The fork's prongs are faceted rather than flat and are exceptionally attractive. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish the Pro S line from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Handles in the Pro S line are heavier and smaller, which makes the knives less weight-forward. The steel used in this line is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines, and the knives are constructed using the same technique. High-tech welding combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, giving the knife its distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Though traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, Henckels claims that the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel.

The high quality carbon provides a large porous area to trap minute particles. Besides providing a small sieve for mechanical trapping of organic wastes, carbon also removes liquid wastes from water. These include urine, dyes or impurities in solution. This action provides sparkling clear water in the aquarium. The large internal surface area also provides numerous points for important bacterial colonies to form and thrive. Carbon should always be removed during medication. It has also been recently noted that carbon will adsorb a large percentage of many of the nutrients in plant fertilizer products. As such, it should be used carefully when keeping live plants. Carbon loses its activity without outward sign. In general, carbon should be replaced on a monthly basis to ensure that active adsorption is maintained. <div class=\"aplus\"> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"/> <h5>Fluval Carbon</h5> Fluval Carbon Filter Media Insert is capable of adsorbing most liquified impurities and dyes present in aquarium water.

Versa-Pod bipod legs are machined from solid billets (aluminum or steel depending on model) and include positive locking notches eliminating movement.

Feeding Suggestions: When your water temperature is consistently above 60 degrees but below 70 degrees, feed one to two times daily. When the water temperature stays above 70 degrees, feed two to four times daily. Warmer temperatures translates to more activity and the need for more food. Always remove all remaining food after the feeding period to avoid over-feeding and the water quality problems associated with this action.\"\tCOL description VAL \"Herbal Actives provide a Natural Aquatic Environment effective against: White Spot, Costia, Flukes (gill and skin), Trichodina, Oodinium, Chilodonella  MICROBE-LIFT/Parazoryne is a unique, natural parasite expellant proven to work against skin flukes, gill flukes, white spot, Oodinium, Costia, Chilodonella and Trichodina, just to name a few. Made from plant extracts and environmentally friendly, MICROBE-LIFT/Parazoryne supports the fishs immune system, driving off the excess parasites. MICROBE-LIFT/Parazoryne is harmless to all nitrifying bacteria and aquatic plants. Naturally controlled by the fishs immune system, parasites are present on most fish in very low levels at all times. When stress levels increase, the ability of the immune system to respond to its requirement to control the natural level of parasites is directly affected. This poor response allows parasites to increase in number, thus causing serious health issues in the host fish. Parasitic infections are characterized by symptoms such as: milky skin, white spots, flashing, heavy breathing and general lethargy. Using chemicals can have a detrimental effect on the bacterial biomass of the tank/pond ecosystem. Please note: as on any healthy fish, there will be some parasites present even after treatment.\"\t0", "label": 0}

Because fruits and vegetables \"breathe\" and require varying amounts of air each container has two vents. The containers' bottoms also have raised grids to elevate produce above its own moisture and prevent spoilage. The vents open and shut with the touch of a finger. High-rate breathers like artichokes and spinach need both vents open. Medium-rate breathers like cabbage and citrus require one open vent. Low-rate breathers like asparagus and berries stay prime with both vents closed. (A chart of various items' needs is included.) The rugged plastic containers are also terrific for ripening tomatoes, apples, pears, and bananas on the counter. The set consists of a rectangular 19-1/2-cup container (14-3/4 inches long, 4-3/4 inches wide, 5 inches high), a rectangular 7-cup container (8-3/4 inches long, 5-3/4 inches wide, 3-1/2 inches high), and a square 4-1/2-cup container (5-3/4 inches square, 3-1/4 inches high).

You regulate the airflow within the container thanks to a completely unique, new venting system. Different fruits and vegetables require different amounts of airflow to stay fresh - FridgeSmart Containers know that and create optimal storage conditions for different produce right in your refrigerator. Special built-in grid lifts food away from condensation. Result? No more yellow broccoli and wasted celery - just delicious, healthy fruits and vegetables for the whole family to enjoy all week long! Say goodbye to soggy lettuce and vegetables with this Fridgesmart storage container. Tupperwares unique ACE (Atmosphere Controlled Environment) venting system allows just the right amount of air into the container by means of two vents on the end of the box. Flip open one or both vents, depending on whats inside--a handy guide gives venting recommendations. For instance, broccoli likes a lot of air, zucchini very little. Raised ridges on the bottom of the container allow condensation to drain away from produce, maintaining freshness. Decorated with a wavy line pattern, the textured lid reduces sliding when another container is stacked on top. While the lid creates a tight seal, some effort is required to remove it. The container and lid are dishwasher-safe but should not be used in a microwave. This storage container measures 9 by 6 by 3-1/2 inches and, like all Tupperware products, carries a lifetime warranty against chipping, cracking, breaking, and peeling. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>\"\t1", "label": 1}

It was made from a single piece of steel, and has a convex edge for easier slicing. The strength comes from the ice hardening process that reaches a Rockwell degree of C-56-58. It has a wide blade with a thick edge to give you ultimate control. Using this knife feels good on the hands thanks to the hollowed handle and compact design, making it ergonomic for repetitive use. The iconic Global dimple design is on the traditional handle for a nonslip grip. 7\" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and \"face-ground\" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Although Global also makes a \"heavyweight\" line for cooks who like hefty knives, its original knives have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. This knife, however, is relatively heavy. Thick at the back, the broad, 7-inch blade, designed for butchering fish and chopping hard vegetables, carries enough weight to chop through fish bones. For clean, low-friction cutting, the blade is tapered to an edge on only one side so it's even sharper than other Global knives. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"\t0", "label": 0}

Prado, renown restauranteur of the very popular La Terraza de la Abuela, explored stoneware production possibilities for his restaurants with Rodo Padilla. While Padilla sought more time for creating fine art sculptures in his studio's, Juan Prado expanded his expertise in high temperature fired ceramics and eventually took over the stoneware production. The happy result of their relationship is the continuation of the ever popular Mug Tree and Accessories line by Padilla and the fabulous square tableware designs and bold new glazes from Prado.\"\t0", "label": 0}

There is a pattern in this collection for everyone. We offer a wide array of aesthetics to complement every table top and d&#xFFFD;cor.

Designed by Wes Helmick in the 15th and 16th century colonial period, when silver tableware was made from silver coins, since our country did not have any silver mines at this time. The coins were melted down, shaped, and hammered to their final form. Lafayette is a beautiful rendition of the hand hammered flatware of the colonial period. If a rustic, hammered look is what you're going for, look no further than Lafayette pattern. With its hammered finish and clean design, the Lafayette pattern is ready for everyday use. From kids to your most distinguished guests, the Lafayette collection is sure to please. The handles taper from a slender neck to a rounded tab end which lifts up off the table. The spoon bowls are squared off for a contemporary look, the forks feature extra-long tines, and the knife is constructed of one solid piece.

Most stainless steel spoons and forks available in the USA are marked with their steel chemistry; usually 18/0, 18/8, or 18/10. All of these compositions should give you years of use with limited maintenance. If you notice discoloring, or small oxidation marks on your stainless, it can usually be cleaned off with hot soapy water, and a sponge. If that doesn't do the trick, use a good quality stainless polish. Often, a rust spot on your flatware is not the flatware itself, but a dissimilar steel peeler or other item leaning against it in the dishwasher. There are many unique finishes available in our Ginkgo Collection. The most durable and stain resistant is our high gloss mirror finish. A smooth mirror finish leaves little for oxidizing agents to attack. Satin finish breaks the surface of the steel, so it is more prone to staining. However, satin finishes, like on our Norse pattern, can be revitalized simple by scrubbing (in the direction of the grain) with a delicate scrubbing sponge or very fine steel wool. This cleans off the surface, and adds more micro scratches. In metallurgy, stainless steel is defined as a steel alloy with a minimum of 11.5% chromium content by mass. Stainless steel does not stain, corrode or rust as easily as ordinary steel (it \"stains less\"), but it is not stain-proof. As an example, mayonnaise left on a knife blade in the sink seems to stain the blade a darker color. There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment to which the material will be subjected in its lifetime. Common uses of stainless steel are cutlery and watch straps. Stainless steel differs from carbon steel by amount of chromium present. Carbon steel rusts when exposed to air and moisture. This iron oxide film is active and accelerates corrosion by forming more iron oxide. Stainless steels have sufficient amount of chromium present so that a passive film of chromium oxide forms which prevents further corrosion. Stainless steel's resistance to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and affordability make it an ideal base material for a host of commercial applications. There are over 150 grades of stainless steel, of which fifteen are most common. There are different types of stainless steels: when nickel is added, for instance, the austenite structure of iron is stabilized. This crystal structure makes such steels non-magnetic and less brittle at low temperatures. For greater hardness and strength, carbon is added. When subjected to adequate heat treatment, these steels are used as razor blades, cutlery, flatware, etc. A typical composition of 18% chromium and 8% nickel, commonly known as 18/8 stainless, is often used in flatware. 18/8 has approximately 18% chromium, and from 8-10 percent nickel. The nomenclature 18/8, and 18/10 are sometimes both used to represent the same type steel. 18/0 has 18 percent chromium, and no nickel. This common steel is often used in flatware sets as it combines the stain resistant elements of 18/8 at a lower cost. In recent years the price of nickel has increased by tenfold.\"\t0", "label": 0}
