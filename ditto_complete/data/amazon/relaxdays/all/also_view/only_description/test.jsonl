Your pet wears a lightweight receiver collar that \"listens\" for the signal. While the collar is receiving the signal your dog is free to run and play in your yard. When he approaches the boundary of the signal area he will hear a warning tone. If your dog does not return he receives a static correction which is startling but not harmful. With simple training your dog will quickly learn his boundaries - typically within approximately 2 weeks. The training of your pet is a key element with the PetSafe Wireless Fence. Follow the easy instruction and training manual that is included. For use in the U.S. only. This unit is compatible with all US 120V outlets and are not to be used with 220V international voltage. REMINDER: The Wireless Transmitter will be located in the center of the circular containment area. The containment area CANNOT be changed into a square or rectangle shape.

Contact PetSafe Customer Care if you have any questions before or after your purchase. Spend less time fussing over installation and more time playing with your pup!

High carbon, no-stain steel bl The thin, long blade of this set's knife makes any fine-slicing job a breeze. The fork's prongs are faceted rather than flat and are exceptionally attractive. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish the Pro S line from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Handles in the Pro S line are heavier and smaller, which makes the knives less weight-forward. The steel used in this line is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines, and the knives are constructed using the same technique. High-tech welding combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, giving the knife its distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Though traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, Henckels claims that the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel.

Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance.  Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy.

Globes filled with liquid have been known for years to ward off flying insects without the use of chemicals like citronella. Its an all natural and low cost way to keep your backyard a \"no fly zone\" for insects. Wards off disease spreading mosquitoes, Fly's and other flying insects. Start enjoying your back yard and BBQ's again without getting chewed up by these pesky critters. How does Shoo-fly work? The use of light refraction. Light refraction happens when a clear object, such as a bag of clear liquid, alters the course and or the velocity of light. The beams of light, which normally travel in a straight line, bend due to the liquid. This effect can be responsible for a number of optical illusions that effect humans, such as mirages. In practice, applying refraction can be just as confusing to insects, especially flying ones. Most flying insects have a highly sensitive array of eyes which allow them to see in multiple directions at once. The refraction of light will keep them scared - confused and away. 1 Shoo-fly is 4 globes with 20 feet of string to hang them and reflector in the globes.\"\tCOL description VAL \"Use Jobes OrganicsFast Start granularfertilizer with Biozomewhen planting seeds and seedlings.Jobes Organics Fast Start Granular Fertilizer with Biozome, is specially formulated to help seeds and new plantings get established by developing and expanding the root system to take in more nutrients for a stronger healthier plant.

Delivers long-term benefits without chemicals. Jobes Biozome is a unique and proprietary blend of beneficial microorganisms Archaea, Mycorrhizal fungi and healthy bacteria. Archaea, a recently identified microorganism found in some of the planets most extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. In garden applications, scientists have discovered that these microbes actually clean the soil, returning it to a healthier, more natural state. Jobes Biozome contains a proprietary species of Archaea that quickly breaksdown complex hydrocarbons and minerals into basic nutrients and trace elements that plants readily absorb. Mycorrhizal fungi expands the surface-absorbing area of the roots by 100 to 1,000 times, sending out filaments that act as extensions of the plants root system, helping plants absorb more water and nutrients. In return, the fungi receive essential sugars and other compounds from the plant roots, fueling their own growth. Finally, the healthy bacterial strain in Biozome improves the soil structure and quality, keeping nutrients near the roots.

His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a \"no light, no pay\" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come. \"\t1", "label": 1}

From Hasbro.  Emmitt James Smith, III (born May 15, 1969) is a retired American football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for fifteen seasons during the 1990s and 2000s. Smith played college football for the University of Florida, where he was an All-American. A first-round pick in the 1990 NFL Draft, he played professionally for the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals of the NFL. During his long professional career, he became the NFL's all-time rushing leader, breaking the record formerly held by Walter Payton, and played for three Super Bowl-winning Dallas Cowboys teams. Smith is the only running back to ever win a Super Bowl championship, the NFL Most Valuable Player award, the NFL rushing crown, and the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award all in the same season (1993). He is also one of only four running backs to lead the NFL in rushing three or more consecutive seasons, joining Steve Van Buren, Jim Brown and Earl Campbell. Smith led the league in rushing and won the Super Bowl in the same year three times (1992, 1993, and 1995) when to that point it had never been done. Smith is also one of only two non-kickers in NFL history to score more than 1,000 career points (the other being Jerry Rice). Smith was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010, and is the first player from the 1990 NFL Draft to be inducted.

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Amazing quality at an amazing price &amp;ndash - that summarises our extensive new 2010 Exage BX STC range of Telespin, and Mini Telespin rods.

The figures are detailed, colorful, and convincing -- certain to charm fans of the movie.<P> Players begin by arranging 24 tiles in a six by four grid at the center of the board. Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play. If they're struggling with the written instructions, they can watch the easy-to-follow video tutorial on the DVD. <P> <b>Interactive DVD Keeps Game Exciting </b><br> The entire game is played alongside the interactive DVD. With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players.

{"ID1": "B002ZOI1IC", "ID2": "B004CYI7I2", "Seq": "COL description VAL \"In order to make Cuba's capital citiy Havanna gleam in renewed splendor, many magnificent buildings are being built. Players can get Pesos or building materials, hire workers, bring the architect into play, collect taxes, send out thieves, hinder the construction of buildings or simply have a siesta while being protected by their body guard. Havanna stands out due to its minimal rules and its ingeniously simple mechanism that calls for different approaches each time you play. It is equally important to use intuition and rapidly find new strategies as it is to carefully plan ahead. No two games are alike, and in the end, exact timing will determine victory or defeat! In Havana you acquire victory points by constructing buildings, available as tiles displayed on the table. To take a building you must pay its requirements - some combination of money, workers and building materials. More difficult combinations yield more victory points. Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection. The game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first. So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your \"half of all pesos in the middle\" is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner. Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him. Other cards add different twists. What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you're aiming for, make up the game's main decisions.\"\tCOL description VAL \"Ty Jingle Beanies - Goodies the Guinea Pig\"\t0", "label": 0}

This product will raise the concentrations of calcium, magnesium, strontium, and carbonates (alkalinity) in the system, and is chloride, phosphate, nitrate, and gluconate free. Each 16-Ounce of Liquid Reactor will treat 5,000-gallon or 18,900 liters and contains 126,000 ppm of calcium and 193,000 ppm carbonates. Kent Marine Liquid Reactor is an aqueous complex of calcium and carbonates; additionally, it provides magnesium, strontium and trace minerals. This material originates from ancient marine deposits that are now terrestrial (not collected from current marine environments, and so does not contribute to reef-destructive collection practices). Liquid Reactor is free of pollutants, and organics which may be present in aquatic muds of terrestrial origin. This is a simple means to dose calcium, magnesium, and carbonates to reef aquariums without the high cost, maintenance, and potential for CO2 overdosing associated with calcium reactor systems. Furthermore, hobbyists wishing to avoid addition of chloride ions to their reefs will benefit greatly from Liquid Reactor as it is chloride-free and will not cause ionic imbalance.\"\t0", "label": 0}

Vectra 3D uses a three pronged approach to keep your pet safe from disease carrying agents by utilizing Dinotefuran, Permethrin and Pyriproxyfen. The Dinotefuran is an insecticide that functions by causing continuous stimulation of the nervous system of insects upon first contact. This stimulation leads to tremors and quick deaths in insects as they land on your dog. Permethrin is an adulticide and works to repel vectors, such as mosquitoes, ticks and sand flies by causing them to lose control of their nervous system. Lastly, Pyripoxyfen, an insect growth regulator, works to prevent development of fleas in their early stages. This keeps them as eggs, larvae and pupae until the other active ingredients functionally decimate them. Vectra 3D has been clinically shown to provide fastacting protection against multiple pests lasting up to one month. In addition to repelling mosquitoes, ticks, and sand flies, Vectra 3D repels and kills fleas, lice, and mites quickly and effectively. In fact, it has been shown to reduce the number of ticks in only 24hours and begins killing fleas within the first two hours of use. Vectra 3D remains effective after bathing and it can be used on dogs and puppies older than 7 weeks. Vectra 3D comes in 4 dosing sizes based on your dogss body weight. The product is available for all weights in packs of 3doses and packs of 6doses.

We got started in apiculture and learned how to raise our own beehives by attending classes organized through our local beekeeping association. With each passing season, though, we noticed there were fewer and fewer wild bees around and more and more beehives collapsing without any obvious cause. After suffering the loss of our own hives, we decided it was time to take action and help save the bees. That's why we established Humble Bee and agreed on a mission - to give back 10% of our profits to charities that encourage local beekeeping activities and promote bee conservation efforts. We want to get more people involved with beekeeping and help newcomers establish their own apiaries. Our beekeeping products are built to the highest safety and quality standards. In fact, we only sell products that we've tested and use at our own apiaries!

You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly.

It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the <b>Grind</b> function for grinding spices, and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover, and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Read to clean up? No problem! To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover, and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover, and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly, and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space.

Today, Messermeister operates as a U.S. company that strives to provide thehighest quality of cutlery and culinary tools to both food-service professionals and home cooks.We are committed to designing new and innovative products and sourcing the world to find the very best quality at the right price for the market. The Park Plaza collection of stamped knives is manufactured using the finest stamped high carbon German krupp stainless steel, featuring a sharp edge and hard blade, allowing it to hold its edge for a long time. The Park Plaza collection features a triple riveted polyoxymethylene POM handle, permamently securing the handle to the full tang and providing a classic design. The riveted handle is made with impact resistant and state-of-the-art materials to withstand rigorous use. Stamped knives are noticeably lighter than forged knives, which is an attribute for those who are not comfortable with heavy knives. This Park Plaza 2-piece carving set includes an 8-inch carving knife and a 7-inch forged carving fork. The carving knife has a narrow spear pointed 7-1/2-inch fine edge blade and is used to separated meat from the bone and slice it into thin portions. The 7-inch forged carving fork features extra long prongs. Messermeister offers a guaranteed lifetime warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. Every knife comes with free lifetime sharpening and reconditioning. Once the edge is no longer sharp, have an expert sharpener re-grind a new edge on your knife or with a return shipping fee, Messermeister will re-sharpen your knife free of charge. Contact customer service at toll free800-426-5134. When carving a roast or turkey, a good knife is only half the battle. You've also got to hold the meat steady or you may slice more than the meat. For those who don't need a foot-long slicing knife to cut their small turkey or roast, this 8-inch carving knife is a nice alternative, and the 7-inch carving fork with extra-long tines will hold it still while you slice. This Messermeister Park Plaza carving set is made in Germany of a high-carbon stainless steel that combines chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium for tensile strength, hardness, and resistance to corrosion. Full-length tangs (meaning the metal blade continues all the way through to the end of the handle) give you a stronger and better balanced knife and fork. Three rivets keep the tangs attached to the black hygienic composition handles. Both the knife and fork feel substantial and balanced in your hand.

Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play.

With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers.

Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000.

Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. \"\t1", "label": 1}

The high quality carbon provides a large porous area to trap minute particles. Besides providing a small sieve for mechanical trapping of organic wastes, carbon also removes liquid wastes from water. These include urine, dyes or impurities in solution. This action provides sparkling clear water in the aquarium. The large internal surface area also provides numerous points for important bacterial colonies to form and thrive. Carbon should always be removed during medication. It has also been recently noted that carbon will adsorb a large percentage of many of the nutrients in plant fertilizer products. As such, it should be used carefully when keeping live plants. Carbon loses its activity without outward sign. In general, carbon should be replaced on a monthly basis to ensure that active adsorption is maintained. <div class=\"aplus\"> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"/> <h5>Fluval Carbon</h5> Fluval Carbon Filter Media Insert is capable of adsorbing most liquified impurities and dyes present in aquarium water.

This game is deceptively simple to learn, but can become as delightfully complex as chess. Strategy is the key, but you'll need dexterity as well, because you don't just place the pieces, you float them. To set up the game, lay out the cloth game mat on any surface. It's best to start on an even surface, but as your skills advance you can play just about anywhere. Once the players have selected colors and split the 52 discs, each lays out five foundation pieces in a circle. After that, you place \"learners\", pieces that float in the air due to their repulsion of the magnetic fields. You have to be careful when you place your learner so as not to create a fault, that is to cause other pieces to flip, stick and form towers. You can capture towers to win, but if you cause faults, the towering pieces go into your unplayed stack. When one player runs out of pieces to play, the towers are counted, unplayed pieces are subtracted from the total and the player with the most pieces wins. But be careful, you can lose immediately if you touch the red disc in the center, cause it to leave the center or have no discs on the play mat with your color showing. It sounds simple, but it is simply wonderful fun, calling for both manual and mental skills. Polarity comes in a great, easy-to-carry canvas bag, with instructions and game pieces. Once you start, plan on becoming addicted. You'll want to join the online forums where beginners and experts discuss strategy, leaning and wild tales of Polarity. Get the balance right and learn to lean when you play Polarity.\"\tCOL description VAL \"\"The best spanosh card in the world give us this unique design, with a double header, means that you do not have to turn around your cards if you have them upside down. like you would do with regular spanish playing Cards.

Near perfect in design, the pan is constructed of three layers of metal; two stainless steel outer layers with an aluminum core. The stainless steel exterior combined with the aluminum core allows the pan to be used on all types of stovetops, including induction, and heats the pan evenly to eliminate hot spots. Additionally, the pan has a non-stick coating which makes food removal and clean-up a breeze. The classically sloped sides help prevent messes, and when you're finished cooking, the pan can be hung through the handle's eyelet for convenient storage. Producing some of the finest cookware in the nation, All-Clad has been featured in many high class and gourmet restaurants for its superior performance and aesthetically designed pieces crafted from American artists using the finest metals. A firm believer in quality over convenience, All-Clad's metals are formulated and bonded with cooking performance in mind, and are combined with stunning designs to provide you with the best cooking experience possible. The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the steel. This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 10 inches in diameter, perfect for cooking tuna or tofu, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for a healthful meal. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's heat. Although Stainless cookware is dishwasher-safe, nonstick pieces should be hand washed. <i>--Fred Brack</i> <b>From the Manufacturer</b> <br> <b>All-Clad Stainless Construction</b> <br> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cookware/allclad.stainless.gif\" width=\"244\" height=\"129\" align=\"left\"> Each piece of All-Clad cookware features a unique metal bonding construction. All-Clad Stainless cookware sandwiches a thick core of three separate layers of aluminum between an easy-to-clean, highly polished 18/10 stainless-steel cooking surface and a magnetic stainless-steel exterior. The aluminum core retains heat and evenly distributes it along the bottom and up the sidewalls of the cookware. The stainless interior is stick-resistant and cleans easily. The magnetic stainless-steel exterior gives the cookware a gleaming finish. All-Clad Stainless also features the company&#x92;s signature \"stay-cool\" long handles, lids fashioned from gleaming 18/10 stainless steel, and highly durable stainless-steel rivets. All-Clad Stainless cookware is one of five collections from All-Clad Metalcrafters. Designed to work on conventional gas and electric ranges, as well as induction cooktops, All-Clad Stainless cookware is the best-selling collection in a full line that includes All-Clad LTD, Cop-R-Chef, Master Chef 2, and Copper Core. <b>Features and Benefits</b> <br> All-Clad pans with a stainless interior cooking surface are oven-safe up to 500 degrees. All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include: <ul> <li>Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer. <li>Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you won&#x92;t have \"hot spots\" when cooking.  <li>Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface. <li>Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles. <li>Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods. <li>Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pan&#x92;s edges to seal in flavor of your foods. <li>The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops.  <li>The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface. </ul> <b>Warranty</b> <br> From date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

Henckels, this value-driven brand guarantees the same durability, design and ease of use for which the global company is known. Equip your kitchen with expertise with Henckels International. This knife's thin 8-inch blade makes any fine-slicing job a breeze and handles most big carving jobs easily. Henckels' International Classic is a moderately priced cutlery line made in countries other than the company's home of Germany. The steel is of lesser quality than that used in its premier lines. Also, the handles are narrower and shallower--a feature those with small hands might appreciate. While this utility knife is dishwasher-safe, hand washing is recommended. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"\t1", "label": 1}

Dental Fresh Original Formula is truly the world&rsquo;s first toothbrush in a bottle for your cat. Adding Dental Fresh to your cat&rsquo;s water bowl daily equates to brushing their teeth every time they drink water &ndash; without the struggles and hassles that most pet parents have had when trying to use a toothbrush on an unwilling cat. Dental Fresh is the only clinically-proven formula for cat oral health providing multiple benefits: cleans and whitens teeth, freshens breath, protects gums while treating gingivitis, prevents periodontal disease, and improves overall dental health.<br /> <br /> When cats develop dental disease, it can lead to additional problems throughout their body. That is why it is so important to recognize the signs of dental issues in your cat &ndash; bad breath, yellow or brown teeth, swollen, inflamed, red, puffy gums, weight loss, and poor appetite &ndash; and prioritize oral health. Dental Fresh makes that incredibly easy. <br /> <br /> Our clinically-proven water additive features a unique self-regulating formula that activates, releases and destroys bad breath causing germs and bacteria microorganisms only when exposed to bacteria, periodontal pathogens, and acidic areas where plaque has formed. The more &ldquo;issues&rdquo; present, the stronger the formula works for your cat. And, in turn, the less &ldquo;issues&rdquo; present, the less the formula targets those areas. All of the cats (and dogs!) in your household can safely drink from the same water bowl because each pet will receive a different dosage of the active ingredient, depending on their individual dental needs. And unlike many water bowl additives on the market, Dental Fresh contains no alcohol, no sugar, no surfactants or detergents, and no pungent mint flavors. It does not cause staining, has no taste or artificial flavorings, and can be safely used long-term. Dental Fresh Original Formula for Cats is available in an 8-fluid ounce bottle.<br /> <br /> We know that your cats are more than just pets - they are part of the family - so Dental Fresh designs premium oral health products that pet parents can actually afford. Your cat will have fresher breath, whiter teeth, and healthier gums and you will feel confident knowing that you are being proactive with your cat&rsquo;s oral health &ndash; making you both happy and able to focus on more important things like naps, games and snuggles.\"\t1", "label": 1}

The collection consists of a 4-inch paring knife, a 6-1/2-inch utility knife, an 8-inch chef's knife, and a 9-inch bread knife, as well as a honing steel, a pair of kitchen shears, and a knife block to keep everything neatly organized. Overall, the knife set measures 14-3/5 by 5 by 12 inches. As part of Shun's Premier line, the each knife features a VG10 steel blade, clad with 32 layers of stainless Damascus, then beveled for lateral stability and incredible precision. The hand-hammered finish not only adds intriguing visual appeal, but it also creates a hollow-ground surface, which reduces knife-drag when cutting and prevents food from sticking to the blade. The knives also come equipped with premium Pakkawood handles in a walnut finish, which offer a comfortable, secure grip. As a sleek and stylish finishing touch, Shun embossed its logo on the end cap of the knives' handles. The high-quality knives can safely go in the dishwasher, but for best results, washing them by hand and letting them air dry is recommended. The knife set carries a limited lifetime warranty. Calling to mind the handcrafting techniques of ancient Japan, the Shun Premier possesses the grace and beauty of hand-forged knives of old. Every blade is made of VG10 steel, clad with stainless Damascus, then ground for lateral stability and incredible precision. Where the steels meet, a wavy line called a Hamon is formed--similar to when samurai swords are tempered using a clay-baking technique. The striking hammered finish (\"Tsuchime\" in Japanese) acts as a series of hollow-ground cavities, reducing drag when cutting as well as quickly releasing food from the blade. The rich walnut PakkaWood handles nestle comfortably in the hand, and the Shun logo embossed on the bottom adds balance and beauty to the knife, whether in the hand or at rest in the block. Kasumi is a traditional Japanese style of knifemaking in which an extremely hard core of high-carbon steel is clad--that is, sheathed or covered--with an exterior jacket of another steel. The somewhat \"softer\" exterior cladding protects the inner cutting core. In Japanese, kasumi means \"mist\" and is so called because the exterior steel can have a lovely misty appearance when compared to the harder cutting core. Kasumi construction provides an ultimate mix of properties: an extremely sharp edge and ease of sharpening. This clad construction is similar to how samurai swords are traditionally made. In Japanese, Tsuchime (Tsoo-CHEE-may) simply means \"hammered\". It does two things: gives the knife a look that is reminiscent of the handcrafting techniques of ancient Japan; and creates tiny pockets of air that act as hollow-ground cavities to reduce drag and quickly release food from the blade. Shun's gorgeous new Premier line features a hand-hammered tsuchime blade finish. Many Shun cutlery lines are characterized by the beautiful Damascus patterning on the blades. In Japan, this is also known as suminigashi, or ink pattern, because of its resemblance to the undulating patterns made by ink in water. To create this style of blade, a cutting core of VG10 is clad on each side with 16 layers of Damascus steel, made up of SUS410 and SUS431 stainless steel. Then the blades are bead-blasted to reveal the elegant, waved pattern. In addition to its beauty, the Damascus has two purposes. First, it protects and supports the extremely hard cutting core. Second, it helps the blade glide through food even more smoothly. You will find Damascus cladding on knives in our Classic, Ken Onion, and Premier series. PakkaWood is a premium handle material made of genuine hardwood impregnated with resin. The resin makes it moisture resistant, strong, and durable. Sanding and buffing brings PakkaWood to a beautiful gloss finish. As with natural wood, no two pieces of PakkaWood are exactly alike.\"\t0", "label": 0}

There are currently 161 different Scramble Squares styles of exquisite original art are available on nature, sports, history, culture, geography, science, technology, occupations, hobbies and activities, and more new styles are introduced every six months.

By the time you've become addicted and find yourself unable to solve the thing, you'll realize it's not so much a motto as a warning. Nine colorfully illustrated cardboard 4-by-4-inch squares depict various unfinished images of dalmatians, English cocker spaniels, German shepherds, and Shar-Pei along their edges. The images must be matched and the nine squares arranged in a larger square.

This knife is made from a single piece of high quality CROMOVA 18 stainless steel with a square tip and an ultra sharp blade. The ice tempered, convex edge can hold a sharper edge for a longer time so you can slice vegetables and make a delicious bowl of pasta primavera. It has an ergonomic handle with a dimple pattern making it comfortable and slip resistant, useful for repetitive slicing. The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. This knife can be used in place of a Santoku knife so you can also cut meats and fruits. 5-1/2\" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and \"face-ground\" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a \"heavyweight\" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 5-1/2-inch knife for precisely slicing and chopping vegetables is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges.

These include urine, dyes or impurities in solution. This action provides sparkling clear water in the aquarium. The large internal surface area also provides numerous points for important bacterial colonies to form and thrive. Carbon should always be removed during medication. It has also been recently noted that carbon will adsorb a large percentage of many of the nutrients in plant fertilizer products. As such, it should be used carefully when keeping live plants. Carbon loses its activity without outward sign. In general, carbon should be replaced on a monthly basis to ensure that active adsorption is maintained. <div class=\"aplus\"> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"/> <h5>Fluval Carbon</h5> Fluval Carbon Filter Media Insert is capable of adsorbing most liquified impurities and dyes present in aquarium water.

Blade made of high-tech molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel. Stainless-steel handle molded for Comfort, dimpled for safe grip. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and \"face-ground\" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a \"heavyweight\" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this cheese knife is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. This 5-1/2-inch knife has holes in its blade so it slips through medium-firm and firm cheeses without sticking. The edge is ground on only one side and is both finely serrated and scalloped for cutting through rinds. Prongs on the end pick up slices for serving. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"Wusthof has been making the finest knives in the world for over 190 years%2E Through excellent craftsmanship and engineering the Grand Prix2 knife line has become one of the most extensive knife lines in the world%2E This 5%2Dinch soft cheese has holes that allow the knife to make thin clean slices with very little sticking to the blade%2E %0D%0A The perfect gift for any cheese lover, this 5-inch knife makes neat work of sticky soft cheeses.

Please read this section before using your cookware for the first time. The information it contains will help you achieve the best possible cooking results. Enameled cast iron is a remarkable and robust material that performs well with modern requirements for food preparation and cooking. Whether you choose to stir-fry, slow-cook a casserole, sear a steak or bake a cake, there is a shape that is suitable. Cast iron performs well for either slow cooking or high-temperature searing. Cast iron can be used reliably on any heat source, including induction, and with any oven or grill. It has the ability to retain heat efficiently, which allows for use of lower heat settings in stovetop and oven cooking. On the table, a hot covered dish will keep food hot for second servings. Cast iron can also be used to keep foods cold. A chilled dish becomes an ideal cold food server on a hot summer day. It can also be placed in the freezer for food storage or advanced food preparation. The vitreous enamel surface is impermeable and therefore ideal for raw or cooked food storage, and for marinating with acidic ingredients such as wine. Grills may be preheated to reach a hot surface temperature for searing and caramelization. This advice does not apply to any other products. For correct grilling and searing, it is important that the cooking surface is sufficiently hot before cooking begins. Sear lines from ribbed grills will not be produced if the pan surface is too cool, or if the food is too wet. Place the empty pan on medium heat and allow it to heat for several minutes. Do not add oil to the cold pan -- the oil may become too hot and smoke. Take a few drops of water on your fingers and scatter over the hot surface. If they sizzle and evaporate almost immediately it is hot and ready for use. If the water produces steam and has no sizzle, heat the pan a little longer and repeat the water test again. When the surface is hot enough, lightly oil it with cooking spray or brush it with oil using a Le Creuset silicone basting brush. Vegetable, ground nut or corn oils are recommended. Olive oil may cause excessive smoking. Once a patina covers the cooking surface very little oil will be necessary. For distinct sear lines, leave the food undisturbed on the surface for several minutes. If the food is moved too quickly the lines will be poor, and steam from the food may be released onto the surface. Any food for grilling or searing must be quite dry before it is placed on the hot surface. Wet foods will not achieve good sear lines and may result in a steamed appearance and flavor. Use paper towels to pat off excess moisture from foods. Oil can then be brushed over the food if desired. Foods that have been marinated should also have excess moisture removed with paper towels. By squaring this skillet and flaring its sides, famed French cookware manufacturer Le Creuset offers extra cooking room for steaks, fish, burgers, or any food that benefits from stovetop grilling and the caramelized flavor imparted by seared grill marks. The raised ribs in the grill's bottom not only provide those marks but also help excess fat and grease drain away from food for lower-calorie cooking. Because cast iron is unmatched for heat retention and even heat distribution (no hot spots), foods will cook uniformly in the 10-1/4-inch-square grill. The unit's exterior provides a colorful, long-lasting enamel that resists chipping and cracking, while its inside offers a durable black enamel finish (no seasoning required). The grill also provides a sturdy, integrated handle with an opposite helper handle for secure transport, as well as dual nondrip spouts--one on each side to accommodate left- and right-handed pouring. Even more, the grill works on any stovetop, in the oven, or under a broiler. It's also stylish enough (think French farmhouse kitchen) to bring to the table. Though it's dishwasher-safe, hand washing preserves a patina that builds up with use and aids in the grill's stick resistance. The skillet grill measures approximately 11-3/4 by 16-3/4 by 2 inches and carries a limited lifetime warranty. <i>--Fred Brack</i>\"\t0", "label": 0}

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. <strong>About Nautilus</strong><br> Nautilus, Inc. is a pure fitness company that provides the tools and education necessary to help people achieve a fit and healthy lifestyle.

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM \"tent cities\" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, Eurekas new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition. For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Womens Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian. <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Whether youre headed to the campground with your family, or elk camp with your hunting buddies, this rugged, all-season tent is well suited for the occasion. Made with premium grade, Hydra-Shield, 100% cotton duck canvas. The tight weave and silicone finish make the canvas watertight yet breathable, minimizing condensation and mugginess. Go ahead and touch the inside walls during a downpourthis canvas will not wick water. The Flex-Bow frame has tempered, spring steel rods that keep the tent taut, and robust 1-inch steel tube poles that will hold up to fierce winds. The floor is a seamless, heavy-duty, puncture resistant, 16 oz vinyl that keeps water out. Easy, one-person setup takes only a few minutes after you have it staked out. The steep walls and 66 high ceiling provide a roomy interior with stand-up, walk-around comfort. Large front and back doors with top rated #10 YKK zippers give convenient access. Four windows, and two vents allow ample air flow. Windows and vents have no-see-um screen mesh, keeping out the smallest bugs. A customizable gear loft and organizer system offer plenty of places to stow gear. A large awning provides shade and a covered entry. The handy strap-and-cinch storage bag means no cramming a tent into an undersized bag. Hefty 12-inch steel stakes included. Whether you're heading to the campground with the family or the elk camp with your hunting buddies, the rugged, all-season Kodiak Canvas Flex-Bow eight-person tent is well suited to the occasion. The Flex-Bow tent is made of a superior, marine-grade, 100-percent cotton duck Hydra-Shield canvas. The custom-woven, treated canvas is ideal for tents, as the double-fill design is strong and durable, while the silicone, dry-finish treatment is watertight, breathable, and durable. As a result, campers will stay comfortable and dry even in a downpour. Unlike synthetic fabrics or canvas with a paraffin- or oil-based treatment, Kodiak's canvas allows water vapor to escape, minimizing condensation, humidity, and mugginess. Plus, you'll rarely--if ever--have to retreat Kodiak canvas. The Flex-Bow frame is every bit as strong, with 1-inch galvanized steel tubing and 3/8-inch Flex-Bow spring steel rods keeping the tent taut at all times. To further improve ventilation, the tent includes two funnel-flow vents that circulate air and assist with temperature management. And campers won't feel claustrophobic thanks to the tent's spacious 6-foot 6-inch ceiling height, two large D-shaped doors (front and back), and four large windows, all covered with no-see-um mesh. Other details include a 16-ounce, polyester-reinforced vinyl floor; a large 84-by-78-inch awning; a customizable gear loft and organizer pockets; and a handy strap-and-cinch storage bag. The Flex-Bow, which sets up easily with one person, is designed for year-round use, but isn't suitable for extreme winter mountaineering or heavy snow accumulations. <table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"10\" width=\"300\"> <tbody><tr><td><img align=\"top\" border=\"0\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/detail-pages/B001NZWQ1C-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The Flex-Bow's spacious footprint sleeps up to 8 people.</strong></em></small></td></tr></tbody></table> <b>Specifications</b><br> <ul> <li>Capacity: 8 people <li>Ceiling material: 10-ounce Hydra-Shield canvas <li>Wall material: 8.5-ounce Hydra-Shield canvas <li>Floor material: 16-ounce polyester-reinforced vinyl with welded seams <li>Frame: 1-inch galvanized steel tubing <li>Rods: 3/8-inch solid spring steel Flex-Bow rods <li>Tent dimensions: 10 by 14 feet <li>Ceiling height: 6 feet 6 inches <li>Pack weight: 79 pounds (includes stakes weighing 6.5 pounds total) <li>Pack size: 30 by 16 inches, with pole bundle measuring 48 inches long and 5.5 inches in diameter <li>Warranty: Limited lifetime warranty </ul> <b>About Kodiak Canvas</b><br> Born in the ruggedness of the Rockies, Kodiak Canvas has quickly earned a reputation for making tough, long-lasting tents ideal for almost any camping scenario.

The ice hardened, convex edge can hold a sharp edge for a long time. It has an ergonomic handle with a dimple pattern making it comfortable and slip resistant, useful for repetitive slicing. The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. Preparing sashimi or sushi is made effortless with the long flat blade that makes precision cutting easier. 10\" L\"\tCOL description VAL \"GLOBAL has razorsharp straight edge sharpened by hand at a 15% angle. Thinner blades for lighter weight giving you more agility with less fatigue. Perfect balance using a weighted hollow handle. No bolster design allowing for full edge use and full-blade sharpening. All stainless steel construction with slip free handle. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and \"face-ground\" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges are also ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a \"heavyweight\" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 10-inch Sashimi slicer is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. And unlike the traditional one-sided sharpened Sashimi knives, this two-side knife, which is ideal for thinly slicing fish and sushi rolls, can be used for both right and left handed chefs. Global also did away with bolsters on its original knives to reduce the weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as the blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between the blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges, and they carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <i>--Fred Brack</i>\"\t1", "label": 1}

Tests show Dyson's suction is double after 10 ounces of dust. Others lose suction - the more you use them, the less they work. Designed by engineering guru James Dyson, inventor of the cyclonic vacuum, the 12-amp Dyson DC07 upright is an inspired combination of power and structural smarts. At the center of the machine's innovation is the Cyclone air path design, an eight-section chamber that creates powerful, consistent suction. The conical chambers generate 100,000 g of centrifugal force, pushing dust and dirt out of the airflow into the vacuum's 1-gallon collection cup. With no bag to clog, the vacuum's 270 air watts of suction remain steady. The large, transparent collection cup is easy to check and empties tidily--pop it off, hold it over a trash bin, and pull the trigger to release dirt without having to touch it. The DC07 also comes equipped with a multipart filtration system to improve overall air quality in the home. The HEPA filter, measuring 412 square inches in surface area, traps microscopic particulates and allergens. Expertly built, the filter is designed to last the lifetime of the machine. Furthermore, Dyson upright vacuums are the first and only vacuums certified asthma friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation. Suitable for bare floors and carpets, the Dyson upright features a 14-inch cleaning path and edge-cleaning bristles. A simple foot pedal switches off the brush roll for bare floors, and the nozzle automatically adjusts for changes in carpet height. The vacuum is equipped for above-floor cleaning with a cleverly stowed, quick-release 17-foot hose with a reversible, extension-wand handle. Onboard accessories include a crevice tool, a dusting brush, and an upholstery attachment, all designed to function without \"sticking\" to surfaces. Made from the same material used in crash helmets, the vacuum is unquestionably durable. Plus, the design only puts 4 pounds of weight on the handle, so pushing and turning is easy. This model comes with a 35-foot power cord and a five -year warranty. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>\"\t0", "label": 0}

Wrapped in the highest quality smoked pork rawhide. Helps promote healthy teeth by preventingtartar build-up. Guaranteed Analysis:80%, Crude Fat (Min)  In the 1990's, the Dingo brand started with a man named Les and his dog, Dingo. Like most dogs, Dingo had an instinctual need to chew, and to his owner's dismay, Dingo enjoyed gnawing on furniture and destroying shoes. In hopes of fixing Dingo's behavioral problems, Les attempted replacing shoes with rawhide bones. Unfortunately, Dingo was not a fan of these traditional rawhide chews. Rather than giving up hope, Les searched for an alternate solution. Coincidentally, Les's wife worked for a jerky company, and Dingo loved the jerky treats. Due to Dingo's adoration of the jerky, Les began soaking the traditional rawhide bones in water and filling them with jerky, leaving some jerky around the edges for Dingo to see. And with that, the Dingo bone was born. Finally, Dingo had a treat that he loved, while still being able to fulfill his chewing needs. Now your dog can enjoy the original Dingo chew in the form of mini bones. The traditional rawhide bone is a durable, edible bone that serves as a common treat for dogs. With the Dingo Mini Packs, dogs reap the dental benefits of teeth cleansing and gum conditioning, while also enjoying the meaty flavor that the Dingo bone ensures. Because all Dingo bones are hand tied with real meat in the middle, they provide the highest quality treat for your dog. This treat is both easily digestible and soft enough not to damage dogs' teeth, making it a safe and healthy bone that your dog will love. In 1997, the Dingo brand was granted a patent for the single most logical improvement on the rawhide dog chew in thirty years. Due to its meat in the middle quality, the Dingo bone is the only product of its kind on the market. This allows dogs to experience a unique treat that's innovation and uniqueness separates it from traditional rawhide bones. Although competitors have attempted to mimic the Dingo bone, no other product combines rawhide with real meat in the middle to create a longer-lasting treat that encourages your dog to chew through the entire bone.

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for 19th-century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. The company even fabricated and erected a series of IBM \"tent cities\" just outside Binghamton, housing thousands of IBM salesmen during the company's annual stockholders meeting, which had outgrown its previous locale. With the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, renowned explorer Sir Edmund Hillary used Eureka's new and innovative Draw-Tite tent--with its practical, freestanding external frame--in a Himalayan expedition to Nepal (Hillary had climbed to the summit of Mt. Everest only six years earlier). In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants during the first all-American Mt. Everest Expedition, where explorers braved fierce 60-plus mph winds and temperatures reached below -20F. Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s, targeting it to backpackers and families. The first to employ the StormShield design, the lightweight, self-supporting backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents in the industry, with sales reaching over 1 million by its 10-year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as companions on other historic expeditions, including the American Women's Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent years, Eureka designed and donated tents to Eric Simonson and his team. The group took two historic research expeditions to Mt. Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history by finding the remains of George Mallory, but the overall mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found several historical artifacts that are now on display at the Smithsonian. <br> <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all-purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in. If you're a backpacker, alpine climber, or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to use something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall, and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three-season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproof camping. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four-season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types: freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floorplan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one- and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it with less weight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents.

The SteelPro takes the guesswork and intimidation out of sharpening, yet still uses the preferred steel method instead of abrasives to create a super-sharp edge. By drawing a blade alternately through one slot then another in the SteelPro approximately ten times, the edge develops micro-serrations that cut food exceptionally well. The guides maintain an angle of approximately 23 degrees. Professional sharpening will still be required periodically in the life of a high-quality knife. Clever design features make this device a pleasure to use. Using a coin, the tops of the two miniature steels can be loosened and the steels rotated when a fresh surface is required. However, the steel is so hard that several thousand strokes are needed to dull it even slightly. The sure-grip handle is comfortable for either left- or right-handed users, and a ring allows the sharpener to be hung. The glossy, chrome-look base is actually a durable plastic but looks smart in the modern kitchen and stays put during use thanks to small rubber feet. Not for use with scissors, serrated knives, or ceramic knives, the SteelPro is covered by a one-year warranty and measures 7 by 2 by 2-3/4 inches. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>\"\t0", "label": 0}

Overall Depth - Front to Back: -10.5 Inches. Overall Product Weight: -2 Pounds. The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder? In addition to the Host Guide, eight player's books, and the tape, the package contains a map of the crime scene, secret clues, guest invitations, and nametags. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>\"\t1", "label": 1}

Antlers are one of the most easily digested forms of calcium available and are regularly consumed by the wildlife including rabbits, squirrels, skunk and mink. Since our antlers are never farm raised these antler never contain steroids, antibiotics, preservatives or any artificial additives. It is important to properly size our antler products to your dog and your pets overall desire to chew. Our Elk Rack Snacks are considered the premier antler on the market today due to the superior density of the antler. Elk antlers do not tend to chip or splinter like some cooked and raw bones do. Given this above average density, we sell our antlers based on overall size and not by weight to ensure that you get maximum value for your money. Additionally, we never cut our antlers in half, as this too can compromise the integrity and durability of the antler.

A pH of 0 is the most acidic, while a pH of 14 is the most alkaline. Different geographies have different tap water conditions with different pH levels, while fish require a specific pH level to thrive. A pH of 7.0 is ideal when keeping a community aquarium containing a variety of tropical fish. Goldfish and livebearers prefer a pH of 7.5. Many Amazonian fish, like angelfish and neon tetras, prefer a pH of 6.5 to 6.8. Mollies and swordtails thrive at pH 7.2 to 7.5. API pH UP Freshwater Aquarium Water pH Raising Solution raises aquarium pH in freshwater aquariums to desired level. Safe for fish and plants. Use when setting up a new aquarium, adjusting pH, or changing water. pH in an aquarium can fluctuate due to fish waste, uneaten food and addition of tap water.

After each move, the Codemaker gives clues to the Codebreaker. With lots of possible code combinations, every game is guaranteed to be a brainteaser. All of this mind game's components can be stored in the game board. For 2 players ages 6 and up; the winner will be a true master mind. Includes game console with built-in storage tray and code peg shield, 72 jungle animal pegs in 6 colors, 30 scoring pegs in two colors, and complete instructions. Younger kids can develop their powers of logic and deduction in this game of code-cracking fun. This version is simplified for younger children and comes with colorful animal pegs, a jungle-and-mountain-theme board, and fewer code options. The point is the same: one player duplicates the other's code in as few turns as possible. The code maker sets a code of 3 colored animals (choosing from 72 in six colors), and conceals it beneath a \"rocky mountain\" tray at his or her side of the board. In each of nine rows (of large holes), the code breaker attempts to replicate the pattern. After each row (or turn), the code maker places red or white creature pieces in the adjacent row of small holes, which gives the code breaker clues on how he or she doing. Complete instructions include rules for younger players (based on colors only), older players (color and position), and expert players (a blank-space option adds complexity).

Coated inside and out with the company's signature  enamel, the dish doesn't absorb moisture and resists chips, nicks,  stains, and odors. It's oven-safe to 500 degrees F and can also go in  the freezer, refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. It even looks  good at the table. The easy-grip side handles--ridged above and lipped  underneath--provide room enough for oven-mitt-sized fingers. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>\"\t1", "label": 1}

Classic three-rivet handles distinguish Pro S from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Pro S handles are heavier and its knives less weight-forward. The steel used in the Pro S line is identical to that of the Five and Four Star lines. High-tech welding of knives this size and larger combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, so a knife's parts have distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, but Henckels says the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Featuring a comfortable and natural stride, the Best Fitness E1 center drive elliptical trainer offers patented technology that ensures the shape of the ellipse is biomechanically correct.

As the battle for Metru Nui rages on, the line between hero and monster has blurred. According to the complex mythology of Bionicle, six heroes return home to find that hordes of spider-like Visorak have taken over the city they fought so hard to save. Trapped and transformed into half-beasts, the Toa Hordika must stage one final epic battle against the Visorak to save the city--and themselves. Enter the Battle Ram. Pulled by a team of leaping Visorak with glow-in-the-dark pincers, this awesome weapon shatters any obstacle in its path. Equipped with a large catapult and nasty set of spikes, the spider-like ram rains \"fiery\" boulders down on everything around it. The six mini Toa Hordika must figure out how to stave off the ram using their own unique weapons and talents. Thankfully, this 189-piece set is easier to assemble than piecing together the Bionicle backstory--in fact, Toa and Visorak come preformed, so you can play right away. The colorful diagrams found in the detailed instruction booklet are invaluable in assembling the remaining pieces of this set, which requires the building skills of an older child or adult. The set includes six mini Toa Hordika (Vakama, Nokama, Onewa, Matau, Whenua, Nuju), seven Visorak, the battle ram machine, and various weapons and battle accessories. As with all Lego products, the design is customizable and compatible with other sets, including the extensive Bionicle collection (sold separately), encouraging open-ended constructive and imaginative play. <i>--Heather Lyndon</i>\"\t0", "label": 0}

Energy efficient, even-cooking, and highly portable, Meco's Deluxe Tabletop Electric Grill features an innovative infrared heating element and 200-square-inches of space for cooking up savory hot meals on the fly. A 1500-watt element emits infrared heat to sear steaks and chicken to tender perfection. Easy-to-control infrared heat cooks evenly without burning. The grill's variable heat control feature enables instant temperature changes from a steak-searing high to a bread-warming low, so there's no waiting or preheating. Unlike charcoal grills that emit an unnatural smoke when juice drips on the coal, the infrared element burns off the dripping fats instantly, smoking food with untainted fumes for a natural, savory taste. Plus, with the Meco electric grill, there's no need for handling flammable lighter fluids or fuel cylinders. The heat reflector is positioned so that it drains excess dripping that might otherwise fuel large, meat-cauterizing flare-ups, though it also retains just enough juice to fuel flames small enough to lightly kiss the meat for a perfect sear. And, there's plenty of cooking space for large cuts of meat, such as, roasts, thick chops, whole chickens, and fancy burgers with all the trimmings. One more cool feature: A dual level mode simultaneously cooks steaks at different temperatures when one diner prefers his steak rare and the other prefers hers well-done. The dual-level mode also keeps bread warm on one side while chicken bakes on the other. Along with all these cooking options, Meco designed this electric grill for simple assembly, easy, economical use, and durability. First of all, the grill is made of high quality steel forms and tubing throughout. And, all components are coated with Meco's quality Dura Fuse powder finish for corrosion resistance and good looks. All critical electrical and mechanical components, including hinges and handles come pre-assembled, so there's no major project to face when the box comes. The tabletop and base attach easily with just a few nuts and bolts. Plus, this energy efficient grill costs half the price of gas grills to operate, and is six times cheaper than cooking with a charcoal grill! Best of all, the whole thing fits into most dishwashers for fast and easy cleaning. <i>--Brian Olson</i>\"\t1", "label": 1}

These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag: <strong><font color=CC6600>Buy for Cold</font></strong><br> It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10. Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for \"warm\" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night. <strong><font color=CC6600>Goose or No Goose?</font></strong><br> The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly <i>and</i> stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use. All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget. <strong><font color=CC6600>Bags for All Shapes</font></strong><br> Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips. <strong><font color=CC6600>Pad Yourself</font></strong><br> No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Ideal for camping at higher altitudes or in cooler months, the Coleman Dunnock Cold-Weather Sleeping Bag helps you sleep comfortably in temperatures as low as 20F.

The extruded 4 mm granules are sized to be eaten easily, decreasing waste. Tropican was developed and researched by the Hagen Avicultural Research Institute (HARI) and earns the HARI Seal of Approval. For over two decades, the HARI Flock has been fed exclusively Tropican Formulated diets! Tropican comes in a variety of extruded formulas and sizes to appeal to a variety of birds needs. The Tropican formulated diets includes: Ample fresh food and water should always be available to satisfy the demands of your pet bird. The food and water cups should be cleaned and re-filled daily with fresh water and fresh seeds to keep your pet bird healthy. Breeding parrots need extra protein to trigger reproductive hormones and ensure a healthy egg production. The female also requires more nutrients in her diet when rearing young because she is eating for more than just herself! While fledgling or juvenile parrot species do reach the outward appearance of an adult by the time they are weaned, their bodies on the inside are still developing and do benefit from a little extra &lsquo;punch&rsquo; of nutrients during this stage of their life. Achieve greater weaning success during this stressful time by spoon feeding warm, softened Tropican High Performance Weaning Diet when making the transition from syringe feeding to solid foods. If the babies are fed Tropican Hand Feeding Formula, they&rsquo;ll quickly recognize the same flavor and adapt to eating the softened Tropican on their own. It is suggested to feed Tropican High Performance Tropican Weaning Diet for the first six months after weaning for most parrot species, and up to nine months for large macaw species. Parrots that have been eating a primary diet of traditional parrot seed mix need a little boost to their amino acid profile, as well as other essential nutrients. They&rsquo;ve been getting all the fat they need, perhaps too much. But, they are not getting a complete amino acid profile; therefore, they haven&rsquo;t been getting the right protein.

Incandescent lamp filaments are made of tungsten. Tungsten is a metal that can operate at very high temperatures without evaporating too quickly an resulting in early lamp failure.

Following a few simple steps to sharpen your valuable knives with this honing steel from W&uuml;sthof's premier line, Grand Prix, will keep the blades as sharp as new for a lifetime. Sharper knives are safer because they don't slip and require less effort to use. To sharpen, hold the steel in your left hand (reverse if you are left-handed) and simply slide the knife blade down the steel at a 20-degree angle. It takes only a few strokes, and you won't believe the difference. This steel sharpens all blades from small to large, including shears. Peer into the private kitchens of professional chefs, and chances are you'll see W&uuml;sthof cutlery. <i>--Amy Adams</i>\"\tCOL description VAL \"When that time comes that you need to touch up the sharp edge of your Wusthof knife the 10\" steel is a good option. This is the deluxe Wusthof 10\" inch steel it has a slightly larger shaft and more substantial handle.it can realign your knife edge quickly and easily. Honing steels are often confused as sharpeners. Your honing steel will realaign your knife edge but will not put a new edge on it. In trying to explain what a honing steel does try to imaging your sharpening steel and your toothbrush. It is a maintaince tool that you use everyday. In the case of your knife this would be maintaining the knifes edge. Now eventually you would need to see your dentist. That would be a sharpener. This would be a more detailed and agressive action and they would actually remove metal from the edge of the knife. Much like a dentist would do to your teeth. Now to maintain healthy teeth you brush everyday. To maintain a sharp knife you should steel your knife everyday. And remember only go to the Dentist(sharpener) once or twice a year. This tool serves a vital role in the kitchen by realigning, or resetting, a knifes' edges, which bend this way and that when contacting a cutting surface. (Often called a sharpening steel, or butcher steel, a steel doesn't actually sharpen a knife--unless it's a diamond steel.) Consisting of a rod of hard steel-alloy and a tough synthetic handle, this steel works as well as any. A loop facilitates hanging it close at hand so the steel can be employed often: before each use is ideal to prevent a blade from becoming dull and prolong intervals between professional sharpenings. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it; this steel's 10-inch rod is sufficient for nearly all household knives. The steel carries a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"\t1", "label": 1}

The birds are still hand-crafted in the U.S. and the flock has increased from one to over one hundred. The birds, critters, dogs and cats are made from recycled materials; scrap and rejected garden tools, farm machinery, bicycle and auto parts. Buying a Yardbird reduces solid waste destined for a landfill. If everyone bought two or three, we could save the earth! Seriously, so far over 2 million pounds of scrap has been recycled into these lovable critters. Each critter has its own personality. No two are exactly alike. Whether its a turn of the head, the placement of the eyes, or the variation in the hand painted finish, each one has a delightful disposition all its own. Painted critters are coated by hand with water-based low bake enamel paints. The colors are bright and cheery. Unpainted critters are rusty and will continue to rust-thats their natural beauty. Since they are made from recycled materials, each critter is slightly imperfect and unique, but lovable all the same. These collectable critters, leave our hands as fast as they&apos;re created.

The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder?

This is the deluxe Wusthof 10\" inch steel it has a slightly larger shaft and more substantial handle.it can realign your knife edge quickly and easily. Honing steels are often confused as sharpeners. Your honing steel will realaign your knife edge but will not put a new edge on it. In trying to explain what a honing steel does try to imaging your sharpening steel and your toothbrush. It is a maintaince tool that you use everyday. In the case of your knife this would be maintaining the knifes edge. Now eventually you would need to see your dentist. That would be a sharpener. This would be a more detailed and agressive action and they would actually remove metal from the edge of the knife. Much like a dentist would do to your teeth. Now to maintain healthy teeth you brush everyday. To maintain a sharp knife you should steel your knife everyday. And remember only go to the Dentist(sharpener) once or twice a year. This tool serves a vital role in the kitchen by realigning, or resetting, a knifes' edges, which bend this way and that when contacting a cutting surface. (Often called a sharpening steel, or butcher steel, a steel doesn't actually sharpen a knife--unless it's a diamond steel.) Consisting of a rod of hard steel-alloy and a tough synthetic handle, this steel works as well as any. A loop facilitates hanging it close at hand so the steel can be employed often: before each use is ideal to prevent a blade from becoming dull and prolong intervals between professional sharpenings.

Place the sticker directly on top of the image you are using. Press firmly with your fingers to remove any air-bubbles and to help secure the adhesive bond. Cut out the image with the sticker on top - carefully cutting along the edge of the sticker, making sure not to cut the sticker itself. Spread glue (a white glue such as Nunn permanent glue or Crafter's Pick works fine) on the backside of the cut out image/sticker. Center the image/sticker glue side down onto the non-letter side of the Scrabble tile (check the orientation of the letter on the back to make sure it's facing the right direction). Press into place and let dry. You can easily add a glue on bail such as an Aanraku bail to the back of the pendant once the front side is dry. It is recommended to use E6000 industrial strength adhesive to adhere the bail.\"\tCOL description VAL \"Wrights easy square junior is great for blocking squares up to 6-inch.

The filter is pleated, so it has a remarkable filtering capacity for its compact size. The filter canister mounts directly to the collector housing. Four finger-operated knobs lock the canister in place, so installation and removal is easy and tool free. For further convenience, a top-mounted handle operates a pair of \"hands\" that wipe across the filter pleats and knock off dust buildup. Turning the handle one full revolution per month is all that is required to keep the dust collector operating effectively. What's more, collector (catch) bag capacity for both fabric and plastic bags is an impressive 10 cubic feet, meaning you won't have to worry about frequent bag changes. <b>Powerful and Efficient Dust Collection</b><br>The PM1300 is powered by a 1-3/4-HP, 1-Ph, 115/220V TEFC (totally enclosed fan-cooled) motor for effective air movement. The motor is secured to a mount on the dust collector's base platform, creating a low center of gravity and ensuring easy movement around the shop. Just as efficient as it is powerful, the PM1300 features all-metal duct construction that provides rigidity and maximum air flow. Additionally, dual four-inch dust ports allow for simultaneous collection from two machines. <b>Convenient Remote-Control Operation</b><br>For convenience, the PM1300 comes with a full-function infrared remote control. The remote emits an invisible light-based signal in a 120-degree cone--so you can use it pretty much whenever the dust collector is within your line of sight. To help save on energy costs, a digital timer can be programmed on the remote for up to 99 minutes of continuous operation at the level you choose. The remote can also be used to turn the dust collector on and off. <table cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"75\" align=\"left\"><tr><td><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/content_26/Q1_2010/jet_B001AZNJT8_3-sm.jpg\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\"></td></tr></table><b>Dimensions and Warranty Information</b><br>The PM1300 measures 29.0 x 72.0 x 37.0 inches (WxHxD) and weighs 150 pounds. Because the canister has an overall height of approximately six feet, it's an ideal choice for shops with low ceilings or overhead clearances, especially in comparison to the taller PM1300 Dust Collector with Filter Bag. The PM1300 Dust Collector with Filter Canister is backed by a five-year limited warranty. <b>What's in the Box</b><br>Dust collector with one base; canister filter system; four casters; one motor/fan assembly; one inlet guard; one inlet port with cap; one lower gasket; one connector tube; one control box; one upper gasket; one collector housing; one support bar; two handles; two plats; four socket head cap screws; one remote control with batteries; one manual; and one warranty card.<br clear=\"all\">\"\t0", "label": 0}

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Double your fun with the new Yankee Coupe towable and lounge from WOW.

Keeps toxic and harmful chemicals off your pets, out of your house, and away from your family. 2. Its economical  one bottles of Terra Pet Naturals Tick and Flea Repellent can last several months! 3. Its better for the environment  at Terra Pet Naturals we use only natural, plant-based ingredients. We also use minimal packaging and recyclable materials. Frequently Asked Questions: Q: How Long Will This product last for? A: It depends on the dogs size, the area where you live, and how frequently your dog might be exposed to ticks and fleas. Each 8 oz. bottle of spray contains approximately 900 single sprays, meaning that it if you used 30 single sprays on your dog two times a week, a single bottle of spray would last approximately four months. Q: My dog has sensitive skin, are these products safe? A: The ingredients used in our products are both gentle and safe. In fact, apple cider vinegar is known to help improve skin conditions! As with all naturals products, it is possible (although unlikely) that your dog might be allergic to an ingredient in our spray. If irritation or swelling occurs, discontinue use and contact a veterinarian. Q: Ive been using your product, but I just found a tick on my dog. Does that mean the product isnt working? A: Although our tick and flea repellents are highly effective and repel the vast majority of ticks, it is possible that once-in-awhile, a tick might still try to attach itself to your dog. If you find this is the case, try applying more spray on your dog, focusing on areas where ticks like to attach (i.e. head, ears). Q: Ive seen other natural tick and flea products on the market. How is yours different? A: Terra Pet Naturals uses a custom blend of 11 different essential oils along with apple cider vinegar, providing maximum protection against ticks and fleas. We use all-natural ingredients and strive to be eco-friendly in all our practices.\"\t0", "label": 0}

Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play.

With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers.

Now you won't have to wait for your central heating system to do what this Broan fan/heater can do instantly. <div class=\"aplus\" ><div class=\"two-third-col\"> You don't need to heat the entire house to have a comfortable bathroom first thing in the morning. The NuTone QT9093WH combination fan/heater/light/nightlight combines a high-output 1500-watt heater with a 110 CFM ventilation fan and 100-watt lighting, warming your bathroom at the touch of a switch. Now you won't have to wait for your central heating system to do what this Broan fan/heater can do instantly. Offering quiet operation, the QT9093WH produces 3.0 sones of noise to ensure your bathroom remains peaceful. Crafted with galvanized steel and a die-cast zinc grille in white enamel, it's a suitable match for any decor no matter how many times you change the paint color. The bright incandescent lighting uses one 100-watt A19 lamp (not included), and its nightlight function (7-watt bulb, not included) has the perfect glow to light a dark bathroom during a nighttime visit. This easy-to-install combination fan and light projects just three inches from the ceiling, and it includes detachable junction box with three wiring knockouts and a four-function wall switch. Other features include expansion-type hanger bars and mounting brackets, plus a built-in quiet, nonmetallic backdraft damper. You hastily get ready every morning, head for work, the office, or school, just when the central heating system has finished warming the entire house. It's about as inefficient as it gets. Spot heating solves that problem. No longer will you heat an entire home when you simply need a bit of comfort in the bath or dressing room, or any other room. Even the most efficient central heating systems send heat up the chimney. But NuTone spot heaters deliver every bit of energy back into your home. There's no external venting, so the electricity you convert to heat is delivered directly where you want it. Permanently lubricated motors are quiet and require no maintenance. They can be operated by a built-in adjustable thermostat or an optional wall-mount controller. Heaters may be converted in the field to a choice of wattages/voltages. And for safety, heaters are thermal overload protected and the complete heater assembly conveniently removes from the housing for cleaning. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. NuTone ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) \"outgas\" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is \"sensed.\" One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next \"ten.\" Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. Today, Broan-NuTone leads the industry with forward-thinking residential ventilation products, customized climate, communications and storage solutions and superior customer service. The Broan brand focuses on range hoods, ventilation fans, heater/fan/light combination units, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) fresh air systems, built-in heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators and trash compactors, while the NuTone brand offers door chimes, central vacuum systems, stereo intercom systems, medicine cabinets, ironing centers, ceiling fans and ventilation fans.\"\tCOL description VAL \"You dont need to heat the entire house to have a comfortable bathroom first thing in the morning.

We've all heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. But too often we grab the easiest thing available instead of something with real nutritional value and flavor. Waffles, especially when made with whole-grain flour, are an extremely easy way to start the day on the right foot. The Morning Baker Belgian waffle iron takes the edge off morning hunger. It heats quickly, lets you know when it's ready, and cooks waffles in only a few minutes--take that time to slice some fruit to top them with. Cleaning up is easy, too, since the nonstick grilling surface wipes clean with a damp sponge or paper towel. The whole iron can be stored either horizontally or vertically, depending on space limitations. <I>--Julija Gelazis</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"Size: Appx. 4\" to 5\" long x 2\" to 4\" tall<br><br>Each of these dog figurines are hand painted for that extra bit of realism.

Girth Measurements: Girth M 27\"-35\" Girth L 30\"-37\" Girth XL 32\"-39\" How To Measure Your Dog Find your dog's girth, which is the widest point of your dog's chest and rib cage area. Harness size measurements are based on girth, which can vary according to breed. Some dogs, like Boxers, are more deep-chested than others. It is important to accurately measure your dog's girth for the best size possible. 1) Stand over your dog and place one end of the tape measure on his spine, just above the widest part of his rib cage. 2) With your other hand, wrap the tape measure behind his front legs and around his body, going underneath the widest part of his rib cage. Place this end next to the beginning of the tape. Put your thumb on the number that meets up with the beginning of the tape measure. The higher number is the girth measurement. 3) Order the proper harness size based on your dog's girth measurement. If your dog's measurement falls between two different sizes, order the larger size if want to allow room to grow.\"\t0", "label": 0}

{"ID1": "B000H7QWDK", "ID2": "B002V1QCCG", "Seq": "COL description VAL \"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> Advantage of Freshly Ground Spices </h5> There are many benefits to freshly grinding pepper, salt, herbs and spices for cooking and seasoning. A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity. When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: <b>Grinding mechanism: </b>Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features. <b>Design and appearance: </b>Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table decor. <b>Ease of Use: </b>A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand. Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty. Peugeot's <b>Pepper Grinding Mechanism</b> is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available Peugeot's <b>Salt Crushing Mechanism</b> features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill. Peugeot's <b>Spice Mechanism</b> is made of ceramic, and is specially designed to grind dried spices and flat leafy herbs to release their essential oils. It is particularly effective with dried aromatic herbs such as thyme, parsley, basil, oregano, and herbs de Provence, as well as dried seeds such as cumin. Peugeot's <b>Chili Pepper Mechanism</b> is made of case hardened steel for optimal hardness and resilience. This patented mechanism features a pre-cutting system and dual chamber reservoir. For use with dry, hot chilis such as birds tongue, African devils and Piri Piri. The <b>Nutmeg Shaving Mechanism</b> is made of treated stainless steel which is corrosion resistant, and offers superior edge retention. The Peugeot nutmeg shaver is equipped with a double stainless steel grater blade and a strong claw which enables the whole nutmeg to be very finely shaved, while keeping fingers safe. Intended for use with whole nutmeg nuts. Peugeot's <b>Wet Salt mechanism</b> has been specially designed for wet sea salt: a spiral guides the salt, ensuring that it does not stick together. The mechanism is made of ceramic because wet salt crystals are soft (wear is not an issue) but corrosive. Intended for use with damp sea salts such as Sel de Guerande. The <b>Coffee Grinding Mechanism</b> found in all Peugeot coffee mills is the foundation of Peugeot's grinding legacy. The case-hardened steel mechanism efficiently cracks and grinds coffee beans to the desired consistency:from espresso fine to coffee- press coarse. For best results, hold mill and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only To adjust the Grind on manual mills not equipped with u'Select, turn the adjustment nut located on the top of the mill. - clockwise to obtain a finer grind - counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind Electric mills permit single-handed use, leaving you free to cook at the same time.

The object is to be the first \"candidate\" to land on the Presidential Seal. The game, designed for children and adults to play together, is divided into two parts: the Convention and the Campaign. During the Convention, you, the delegate, must accumulate enough correct answers about presidents and the presidency to advance to the Campaign portion, where you'll have to answer questions about U.S. history and geography. The beauty of this game is that the questions are grouped into four difficulty ratings--easy child, hard child, easy adult, hard adult--so players of all knowledge levels can play together. Some of the easy questions are really easy (\"Name the national anthem of the U.S.\"), while others seem a bit obscure (\"Did Dakota Territory troops fight in the Civil War?\"). The game also tests your honor, since the answers to many questions appear visually on the board itself (\"What are the states that border Lake Michigan?\").

The company's \"belief in the unlimited possibilities of play\" and dedication to producing the best possible toys is highlighted by this huge, intricate set. <P> Redesigned to include modern bricks and details, this 1950's town center includes a gas station with a car wash, a movie theatre, and the town hall building. There are eight Lego mini-figures, classic cars, corner light fixtures, and a fountain to place in the town square. Collectors are sure to notice the inclusion of unique Lego elements and bricks in rare colors. <b>Bringing the Town to Life</b><br> With 35 bags containing 1,981 pieces and two large instruction booklets, the Town Plan set took our eight-year-old Lego tester about 12 hours to build. Like with all Lego sets, the instructions include here provide colorful step-by-step images that make it fairly easy for any diligent builder to create the detailed town buildings and vehicles. We did have about 20 left-over pieces at the end of construction, which puzzled our tester. While it may seem like this mature set is designed to appeal to adults, our young tester immediately found lots of different ways to have fun with it. The cinema got a big thumbs up for having cool, realistic details like popcorn at the concession stand and a movie on the screen. The moving garage door and the scrubbers in the car wash were big hits, too. <P> The rooms inside Town Hall are a little small, which limits Lego figures who want to move around. This pushed lots of play out into the open area around the fountain. The three gold bricks in the fountain add a unique touch to this particular set. The one minor complaint that surfaced in our testing was that the flowers and vegetation \"planted\" around the Town Hall failed to stay securely attached when moving pieces around. Overall, this is an expansive town set that promises lots of creative construction projects. With so many people and buildings, and more than one vehicle, this Town is a great pick for a single creative builder or cooperative play with friends and siblings. Additionally, with its unique 1950's vibe, this town is set to inspire fun, interactive play between parents or grandparents and kids. Odds are, you'll even find yourself driving the vintage car through the wash after your children have gone to bed--it's that cool. <b>What's in the Box</b><br> 1,981 Lego pieces and two instruction booklets. <br clear=\"all\">\"\t0", "label": 0}

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack.

{"ID1": "B00005MEH6", "ID2": "B00012BJSE", "Seq": "COL description VAL \"Good knives make any cutting task more enjoyable. These three, must have, knives are a perfect starter collection in any kitchen. The sandwich, 8inch cooks knife and a paring knife are the most versitile kitchen knives and are used for a variety of tasks. The Wusthof Culinar brush stainless handle design is combined with a contoured shape to add comfort and control. Located in The Cutlery Capital of the World, Solingen Germany, the Wusthof factory history goes back as far as 1814 when the company was listed with the Duchy of Berg. To this day, the company remains family owned. Throughout it&#8217;s history, Wusthof has focused almost solely on the manufacturing of forged knives for the professional chef and home cooking enthusiast. Wusthof uses a special blend of German steel through out the whole length of the knife. The ingredients of this steel are proudly etched on each blade. Wusthof not only uses the best materials to make a fine knife, but it is also crucial that each blade is precisely tempered. This tempering allows the knife to hold its edge for an extremely long time, yet still be able to be maintained in your home kitchen with out the need to be sent away for maintenance. Our unique compound angle is not seen in many knives. This angle tapers from the spine of the knife to the edge to allow for a sturdy, yet extremely sharp edge while it also tapers from the bolster to the tip to give the knife strength as well as flexibility. Elegant satin-finish handles sculpted from 18/10 stainless steel distinguish Culinar cutlery from W&uuml;sthof's other cutlery lines. Otherwise Culinar knives embody all the virtues of other W&uuml;sthof knives that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. The three knives in this set exemplify that control while providing a cook with the essentials: an 8-inch cook's knife (chef's knife) for rocking through chopping and mincing tasks, a 6-inch sandwich knife for myriad slicing and cutting needs, and a 3-1/2-inch paring knife for fruits and vegetables. Like all fine cutlery, these knives should be hand washed. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"Chef Specialties 7 Inch Lehigh Pepper Mill and Salt Shaker Set .\"\t0", "label": 0}

The result will be reduced prices for big items in this new line. The first Black Label item is the 65-ton M103 Heavy Tank that served with the US Army and US Marine Corps (USMC) during the height of the Cold War from 1957-1974. Its whole design was predicated on the need to counter Soviet heavy tanks and thus it boasted a rifled 120mm M58 cannon for long-distance engagements. This gun fired a separate-loading round, which required two loaders, thus giving five men in the crew. The armor was up to 180mm thick on the front of the turret. Some 300 T43E1 tanks were built, of which 219 were later converted to M103A1 standard and 153 rebuilt into M103A2 s. Dragon's kit is a brand new item and practically every part in the cram-packed box is a new tooling. The only exception is the wheels, which are derived from a previous release. The irregular form of the turret is accurately shaped and it has just the right degree of a subtle cast texture. The cast texture on the hull is also beautifully recreated. This tank has been produced with modeling convenience in mind too, with such features as easy-fitting DS tracks. With Dragon's know how and technological skills from its WWII range being applied to this more modern subject, this M103A1 Heavy Tank sets high standards. It's truly a heavyweight in modern armor kits! Dragon's 1/35 scale WWII plastic kits are legendary worldwide in terms of the range's scope, accuracy and technical quality. Utilizing that expertise and experience, a brand new line called Black Label is going to offer some exciting subjects to eager modelers. What is Black Label?

Because this tool's surface contains diamond dust, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. While using this steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings. This steel will also perform better than a steel without diamond dust because it accomplishes the final task of a professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine point while realigning the edge. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it, and this steel's 12-inch rod handles all household knives.

For further convenience, a variable-speed, self-propel system and quiet, powerful motor keep the Lawn-Boy moving smoothly. <br /> <table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"250px\"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img alt=\"Lawn Boy - 10640 Walk-Behind Mower\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/content_26/Q1_2010/c26-B001MYLQDS-2-s.png\" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><em><strong>A variable-speed, self-propel system keeps the Lawn-Boy moving smoothly.</strong></em></span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><em><strong> The easy-start system lets you start the engine with one quick pull--no priming.</strong></em></span></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>ReadyStart Engine and Rear-Wheel Drive for Easy Operation</strong><br />Thanks to its ReadyStart Briggs and Stratton 675 series engine, you won't have to worry about priming or operating the choke on the Lawn-Boy 10641. Simply start the engine with one quick pull, and you're ready to mow. Because it's powered by rear wheel drive, the Lawn-Boy 10641 maneuvers well on irregular surfaces. Large 7-inch front wheels and 8-inch rear wheels help the Lawn-Boy 10641 run smoothly, easily gliding around turns and over obstacles in your yard. <strong>Versatile Cutting System Meets Your Needs</strong><br />The Lawn-Boy 10641 is ready to mulch, bag, or side discharge, depending on your needs. Without the bag, the mower will mulch the grass and leaf clippings back into your lawn. Alternatively, you can collect the grass and leaf clippings directly into the bag, leaving your lawn neat and clean. For further convenience, the height of the blades is easily adjustable by setting the oversized handle grips to one of the large notches on each wheel. There are 7 different heights available between 1 and 4 inches, so you'll be sure to find the perfect setting for your lawn. <strong>Designed with You in Mind</strong><br />Built with you in mind, the Lawn-Boy 10641 has plenty of user-friendly features. To start, a one-piece handle increases maneuverability, and the lightweight, 20-inch steel cutting deck is perfect for mowing in tight areas. Additionally, the top-mounted bagging system makes it easy to empty and replace the bag by simply inserting or removing the grass bag handle from the two notches at the base of the mower handle. <strong>Warranty Information</strong><br />The Lawn-Boy 10641 Walk-Behind Mower is guaranteed to start on one or two pulls for three years, or it will be fixed for free. It is also backed by a two-year No-Worry Warranty that offers full coverage of materials, components, and workmanship. The maintenance-free transmission and engine are also covered by a three-year Power Train Warranty.<br /><br /><strong>What's in the Box</strong><br />Lawn-Boy 10641 Walk-Behind Mower and oil.\"\tCOL description VAL \"At Toland Home Garden, we are proud to be creating the best decorative garden products on the market.

His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a \"no light, no pay\" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.\"\tCOL description VAL \"The TRUGLO Glo-Dot Xtreme Universal shotgun sight fits all ventilated rib shotguns.

It will instruct you to pick one, two, three, or four cherries from your tree and put 'em in your basket. That is, of course, if you don't land on the bird or the dog, requiring you to take two cherries from your basket and return them to the tree.

The fan operates at only 6.0 sones. Offering either wall or ceiling installation, its compact polymer housing fits easily between ceiling joists or wall studs. Double-strength steel mounting flanges have keyhole slots for easy installation, and torsion spring grille mounting means that no tools are necessary. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. Broan ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) \"outgas\" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is \"sensed.\" One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next \"ten.\" Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation.

The recipe for a great dish starts, surprisingly, with a great dish! Corningware French White bakeware proves that when it comes to food preparation, few things are more convenient than baking and serving in one dish. With its classic, fluted design, French White oven-to-table bakeware imparts a traditional elegance that is a perfect complement to any dcor. Versatile yet stylish, Corningware French White is simple, from start to finish! Most of us have become masters of multitasking--answering phones, checking e-mail, and reading simultaneously, and Corningware follows suit with dishes designed for the microwave, oven, tabletop, dishwasher, and refrigerator. Corningware's French White bakeware combines the functionality of classic designs with contemporary styling. This 1-1/2-quart oval baking dish is ideal for pastas, casseroles, or meats, and features a glass lid with an easy-to-grasp handle (but as with all Corningware and other ceramic or glass bakeware, you'll always need to use potholders when handling the dish or its lid). The dish itself has no handles; however, its impressive 10-year warranty (one year on the glass lid) more than compensates for this. <i>--Ariel Meadow Stallings</i>\"\tCOL description VAL \"<div class=\"aplus\"> <!-- A+DIY for ASIN: B00004SBK0 --> <!-- Created by: Todd Densley --> <!-- Email: tdensley@lecreuset.com --> <!-- Coded with Kuramoto@ A+DIY Tool --> <h4>Le Creuset Bakeware: Le Creuset Stoneware 1-1/2-Quart 9-Inch Square Baking Dish, White</h4> <h5>From indulgent desserts and hearty casseroles to freshly baked breads and more, Le Creuset's assortment of quality bakeware ensures perfect results from the oven every time.</h5> <div class=\"leftImage\"><img alt=\"Potato Au Gratin\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/aplusdiy/B00004SBK0/potato_gratin_full.jpg\" /><div class=\"imageCaption\"></div></div> Le Creuset stoneware dishes are versatile, multi-purpose designs that offer all the even-heating benefits of stoneware in a variety of shapes and capacities to fit nearly any baking, roasting or broiling recipe. Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary. This 9-1/4-inch square baker, crafted from commercial-grade  stoneware with Le Creuset's poterie glaze, cooks up a mean hot dish and  looks good doing it. Coated inside and out with the company's signature  enamel, the dish doesn't absorb moisture and resists chips, nicks,  stains, and odors. It's oven-safe to 500 degrees F and can also go in  the freezer, refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. It even looks  good at the table. The easy-grip side handles--ridged above and lipped  underneath--provide room enough for oven-mitt-sized fingers. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>\"\t1", "label": 1}

The machine&#x2019;s cleaner head has an active base place, which self-adjusts automatically for optimal contact with all floor types. On hard floors the base plate lowers to create an efficient seal, and the brush bar lifts clear off the floor to protect delicate surfaces. On carpet, the base plate rises and the brush bar lowers for optimum bristle penetration- removing ground-in dirt and pet hair from different depths of carpet pile. And because the cleaner head adjusts automatically, there are no fiddly dials and you don&#x2019;t need to bend down to make adjustments. <br><br> Dyson cyclones capture more dirt than any other cyclone. DC40 Multi floor has Radial Root Cyclone technology with remodeled airflows to maximize suction power. DC40 Multi floor also has patented Ball technology. It turns on the spot, which allows you to maneuver more easily around obstacles and into awkward spaces. And because the motor and other key components are located inside the ball, the machine has a lower center of gravity- making it even easier to steer.   <br><br>  <h4>Patented Dyson Technology</h4> <b>New Radial Root Cyclone Technology</b> Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. As you use them, the tiny holes in the bag clog up with particles of dust. This restricts the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don&#x2019;t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the bin. No bag. No loss of suction. <br>  Dyson has been continually refining cyclone technology since inventing it more than 20 years ago. DC40 Multi floor has new Radial Root Cyclone technology. Reconfigured air channels and improved flow efficiency reduce turbulence and preserve air pressure, so that the inner cyclones can extract more microscopic particles. These refinements help remove more dirt, dust, allergens and pet hair for the airflow. <br>  <br><b>Ball Technology to Help You Steer with Ease</b> Dyson Ball upright vacuum cleaners use patented Ball technology to overcome the steering limitations of fixed wheels. They ride on a ball, which turns on the spot so you can steer with ease, changing direction with just a turn of the wrist. <br><br>  The ball itself is made of glass-reinforced polypropylene- the same material used in the manufacture of car dashboards. It combines high impact strength with the resistance to distortion. The ball also holds the heaviest component, (the motor), positioned towards the base for a lower center of gravity and greater stability. <br><br>   <h4>Features</h4> <b>Self-adjusting cleaner head: </b> DC40 Multi floor has an active base plate. It creates the optimal cleaner head contact for every floor type, reducing air leaks and retaining suction power on all floor types- wood, carpet, vinyl and tile. <br><br> <b>Instant release wand: </b>DC40 Multi floor has an instant release, long reach wand for cleaning stairs and awkward areas- it stretches up to 5 times in length. There are no separate parts to assemble. <br><br> <b>Extra tools: </b>DC40 Multi floor comes with a Combination tool and a Stair tool. The Combination tool has a debris nozzle that converts to a brush tool for dusting. The Stair tool removes dirt and dust from corners and against vertical edges of stairs. <br><br> <b>Approved for allergy sufferers: </b>All new Dyson upright and canister vacuums are certified asthma & allergy friendly by the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America. Dyson cyclones capture microscopic particles down to 0.5 microns in size, including pollen, mold and bacteria. <br><br> <b>No extra costs: </b> DC40 Multi floor comes with a 5 year warranty - parts and labor guaranteed by Dyson. <br><br> </div>       <div class=\"half-col last\"> <div class=\"half-col\">   <div class=\"leftImage\"><img style=\"max-width:95%; border:3px solid black;\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dyson/InstantWand-Use._SL500_.jpg\" alt=\"Wand\"/><div class=\"imageCaption\">The included instant release wand stretches up to 5 times in length</div></div><br><br>  <div class=\"leftImage\"><img style=\"max-width:95%; border:3px solid black\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dyson/Clear-Bin-use._SL500_.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Bin\"><div class=\"imageCaption\">A clear bin lets you see just how much you have picked up</div></div>   <tr> <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"> <table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border:1px solid #666565\" width=\"250\"> <tbody> <tr bgcolor=\"#000000\"> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;font-weight:bold;color:#ffffff\"> What's In The Box?</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor=\"#bcbec0\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">DC40 Upright Multi Floor Vacuum</td> </tr> <tr bgcolor=\"#a7a9ac\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Extension Wand </td> </tr> <tr bgcolor=\"#bcbec0\">  <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Operating Manual</td> </tr> <tr bgcolor=\"#a7a9ac\">  <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Quickstart Guide</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor=\"#bcbec0\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Stair Tool</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor=\"#a7a9ac\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Combination Accessory Tool </td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor=\"#bcbec0\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Product Registration Card</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor=\"#a7a9ac\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">5-Year Warranty</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  </div>    <div class=\"half-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\"><div class=\"centerImage\"><img style=\"max-width:95%; border:3px solid black;\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dyson/Cyclone_dc40-Use._SL500_.jpg\" width=\"280\" height = \"340\" alt=\"Radial Root\"><div class=\"imageCaption\">Dyson Radial Root Cyclone Technology - No bag.

This flooring option is perfect for a variety of antivibration and floor protection applications. Because the material is domestically made with 100% recycled rubber, this mat is both socially and ecologically responsible. This product is excellent for indoor or outdoor applications due to high contents of EPDM (i.e., a UV/Ozone resistant elastomer) found in the recycled tire rubber. Recycled rubber is a superior material for reducing noise, containing vibration, and absorbing shock from workout equipment. This floor protector mat is specifically manufactured for durability and is designed for both residential and commercial applications often exposed to heavy foot traffic. Moreover, the space-age polyurethane based binder used during the manufacturing process enhances rubber's natural anti-fatigue qualities. Each washing machine vibration mat is fabricated from thousands of rubber granules and offers superior underfoot comfort and support along with a resilient cushioning for the shock of running, exercising, walking and standing. One of the biggest concerns commonly associated with rubber matting is its installation. However, this anti vibration pat weighs roughly 50lbs in a 4ft x 10ft roll and generally lies flat under its own weight; therefore there is no need for permanent adhesives.\"\t0", "label": 0}

Poly is affected by sunlight deterioration (more so than any other synthetic or natural fiber rope), but its life can be extended by storing it away from direct sunlight. Poly begins to weaken and melt at 150 F, the lowest melting point of all synthetic ropes. It is not as strong as nylon or polyester, but two to three times stronger than manila.
