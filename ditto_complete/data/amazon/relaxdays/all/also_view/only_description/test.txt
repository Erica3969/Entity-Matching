COL description VAL "The PetSafe Wireless Fence Pet Containment System is a revolutionary concept that provides the safest, simplest form of pet containment. Plug in the transmitter somewhere inconspicuous in your home. The transmitter emits a unique radio signal around your home. Your pet wears a lightweight receiver collar that "listens" for the signal. While the collar is receiving the signal your dog is free to run and play in your yard. When he approaches the boundary of the signal area he will hear a warning tone. If your dog does not return he receives a static correction which is startling but not harmful. With simple training your dog will quickly learn his boundaries - typically within approximately 2 weeks. The training of your pet is a key element with the PetSafe Wireless Fence. Follow the easy instruction and training manual that is included. For use in the U.S. only. This unit is compatible with all US 120V outlets and are not to be used with 220V international voltage. REMINDER: The Wireless Transmitter will be located in the center of the circular containment area. The containment area CANNOT be changed into a square or rectangle shape. A variety of factors, including terrain, topography and metal objects such as automobiles may affect operating range. Contact PetSafe Customer Care if you have any questions before or after your purchase. Spend less time fussing over installation and more time playing with your pup! Short training sessions will have your pets aware of their limits quickly. Plus, our waterproof collars offer 5 levels of static correction (and a tone-only mode) for customized reinforcement based on your dogs temperament. And for trips, the unit is easily portable  just plug it into an outlet! Cover a maximum of 180 feet in diameter or 90 feet in radius, with a minimum of 10 feet in diameter or 5 feet in radius.

COL description VAL "J.A.Henckels Twin Pro_S 2-piece set set features a 7-inch Carving Fork and 8-inch Carver knife, and are constructed under Henckels sigmaforge standards which guarantees perfect geometry, as well as better weight and balance. High carbon, no-stain steel bl The thin, long blade of this set's knife makes any fine-slicing job a breeze. The fork's prongs are faceted rather than flat and are exceptionally attractive. Classic three-rivet handles distinguish the Pro S line from Henckels's other quality lines, TwinStar, Five Star, and Four Star. Handles in the Pro S line are heavier and smaller, which makes the knives less weight-forward. The steel used in this line is identical to that used in the Five and Four Star lines, and the knives are constructed using the same technique. High-tech welding combines three steel types into what appears to be a single piece, giving the knife its distinct characteristics: a hard edge; a strong, stain-resistant bolster; and a stain- and corrosion-resistant tang. Though traditionalists insist on single-piece forging for strength, Henckels claims that the invisible welds are actually stronger than the steel. These knives may be placed in the dishwasher, but hand washing is recommended. <I>--Fred Brack</I> <P> <B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/henck-pro-s-block.jpg </td> <td> The J.A.

COL description VAL "The multi-purpose Reversible Griddle from Nordic Ware is one piece no fully equipped modern kitchen can live without! With one smooth side for frying eggs and pancakes, and another side with raised grates for searing and grilling meat, this cast aluminum griddle does it all.  Cast aluminum conducts heat very evenly across its surface, helping you achieve nicely browned, evenly cooked results every time you use it. This griddle is lighter weight than a cast iron griddle so it is safe for use on ceramic and glass top stoves, as well as, electric and gas stove tops. It is not induction compatible. Proudly made in the USA by Nordic Ware. <br/><br/> For optimal results: Always start with a clean pan to prevent smoke from food residue when the griddle is used on the opposite side. Unlike cast iron, which requires a pre-seasoning process, our cast aluminum griddle is non-stick coated and only a small amount of oil or butter is needed to prevent sticking. Because cast aluminum heats evenly and quickly, a low or medium heat setting is all that is needed for great results.  Overheating our griddle or heating it without food can damage the non stick surface and warp the pan.   <br/><br/> Clean the griddle with mild soap and a soft cloth after each use and never use metal utensils or abrasive cleaning products, which will scratch the nonstick surface of the pan. Dishwasher use is not recommended, as it will diminish the release properties of the nonstick coating on the pan.

Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance.  Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy.

COL description VAL "Shoo-Fly Globes (pat. pending) are a unique all natural way to make your back yard or BBQs a "no fly zone" for flying insects. Globes filled with liquid have been known for years to ward off flying insects without the use of chemicals like citronella. Its an all natural and low cost way to keep your backyard a "no fly zone" for insects. Wards off disease spreading mosquitoes, Fly's and other flying insects. Start enjoying your back yard and BBQ's again without getting chewed up by these pesky critters. How does Shoo-fly work? The use of light refraction. Light refraction happens when a clear object, such as a bag of clear liquid, alters the course and or the velocity of light. The beams of light, which normally travel in a straight line, bend due to the liquid. This effect can be responsible for a number of optical illusions that effect humans, such as mirages. In practice, applying refraction can be just as confusing to insects, especially flying ones. Most flying insects have a highly sensitive array of eyes which allow them to see in multiple directions at once. The refraction of light will keep them scared - confused and away. 1 Shoo-fly is 4 globes with 20 feet of string to hang them and reflector in the globes."	COL description VAL "Use Jobes OrganicsFast Start granularfertilizer with Biozomewhen planting seeds and seedlings.Jobes Organics Fast Start Granular Fertilizer with Biozome, is specially formulated to help seeds and new plantings get established by developing and expanding the root system to take in more nutrients for a stronger healthier plant. The Jobes Biozome advantage for organic gardening: improves the long-term soil quality of your garden, increases root mass, promotes plant growth and helps your garden resist disease, insects, drought and other unfavorable conditions within a growing season. Delivers long-term benefits without chemicals. Jobes Biozome is a unique and proprietary blend of beneficial microorganisms Archaea, Mycorrhizal fungi and healthy bacteria. Archaea, a recently identified microorganism found in some of the planets most extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. In garden applications, scientists have discovered that these microbes actually clean the soil, returning it to a healthier, more natural state. Jobes Biozome contains a proprietary species of Archaea that quickly breaksdown complex hydrocarbons and minerals into basic nutrients and trace elements that plants readily absorb. Mycorrhizal fungi expands the surface-absorbing area of the roots by 100 to 1,000 times, sending out filaments that act as extensions of the plants root system, helping plants absorb more water and nutrients. In return, the fungi receive essential sugars and other compounds from the plant roots, fueling their own growth. Finally, the healthy bacterial strain in Biozome improves the soil structure and quality, keeping nutrients near the roots. For faster results combine Jobes OrganicsFast Start fertilizer with a Jobes potting soil mix. Jobes Jobes Organics Fast Start fertilizer is OMRI listed and may be used in certified organic food production according to the USDA National Organic Program.Jobes OrganicsFast Start fertilizer will help your organic garden thrive.

COL description VAL "With Hot Rod flames on your mixer, it gets tons of attention like your mixer should! Notice the nice color bleed, the pin stripping, and smell of envy it creates! Actual color bleeds and pin striping will be similar, but each is one of a kind due to printing variations.   The decal flames that are separate pieces can be cut apart and placed on other parts of the mixer, like the sides, to give a real customized look to your mixer.  Beware of cheap imitations. Cheaper prices mean cheaper vinyl (if vinyl at all), uncut flames, cheaper ink, and GREAT UNHAPPINESS. This vinyl is meant to last 5 years outdoors(!) so it will last in your kitchen as long as your mixer does.   Basic installation instructions, cleaning pad, and trouble shooting guide included FREE with order. Please do not use harsh chemicals like 409 as it may damage the graphics. For added protection a layer of shellac (which is always food grade) is acceptable.  Installation is easy. Clean with heavy soap and rinse all residue off. Mark the location. Take off the sticky paper, press the sticker on your mixer, remove the protective top paper. Anyone can do it and it makes a GREAT GIFT!  The kit wont interfere with your accessories, the Pasta Maker, Food Grinder, Juicer, Can Opener, Ice Cream Maker, Sausage Stuffer, Slicer Shredder, Grain Mill, extra bowl, or pouring shield.  Note also if you send your mixer back to KitchenAid under warranty, so go your flames. This product is has no affiliation or endorsement by KitchenAid.

His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a "no light, no pay" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure.

Modeled on the popular book, <a  href="/exec/obidos/ASIN/0590254677/${0}"><I>Franklin Goes to School</I></a>, this game  takes players around a schoolroom game board with the object of being the first player to  reach the yellow school bus. Each player chooses a marker that represents a character  from the books, including Bear, Fox, Snail, and Franklin the Tortoise. Players advance by correctly answering school-related questions. The game is adjustable according to age group. Preschoolers answer questions such as "Can you find a triangle shape on the board?" while 8-year-olds are asked, "What letter do 'knock, knock' jokes start with?" The attractive game board and Trivial Pursuit-style format make this a high-quality game. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>"	COL description VAL " Run, little mice, run! Many people played this board game as kids and new generations can enjoy classic gameplay with the Mouse Trap game. Players move their mouse pawn around the gameboard collecting cheese wedges and building the entertaining and crazy Mouse Trap contraption&hellip;but don't get trapped! The goal is to trap other players' mouse pawns in the trap while trying to be the last player left. Kids and parents can enjoy lots of laughs while playing this board game together. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. Build a better mousetrap? We dare you. Naturally, the object is to trap mice in the mousetrap, while avoiding getting trapped. By rolling the die, you proceed around the game board, collecting cheese pieces and building a mousetrap bit by bit. Once complete, you set the wheels in motion, as it were, to try to capture the opposition's mice. But this is no ordinary trap. With this contraption you start by turning the crank, that rotates the gears, that push the lever, that moves the shoe, that kicks the bucket, that sends the ball down the stairs and into the gutter, that leads to the rod that releases a second ball, that falls through the bathtub and onto the springboard, that catapults the diver into the washtub, that causes the cage to fall and--whew!--hopefully, capture a mouse. The last "mouse" left uncaptured wins <i>--Alison Golder</i>"	1

COL description VAL "Featuring a comfortable and natural stride, the Best Fitness E1 center drive elliptical trainer offers patented technology that ensures the shape of the ellipse is biomechanically correct. This means the machine moves in the same natural motion as your body does, providing a true running feel. Inferior designs can have either too much vertical movement or too much horizontal movement; those units will often make the user feel off-balanced while exercising. The E1, however, will keep you in a balanced upright position for a stable and secure feel. The E1 also has a balanced steel frame which eliminates rocking while maintaining a compact footprint, which makes it ideal for your home workout area (particularly when space is a concern). Combined with its durable components, the steel frame supports users up to 275 pounds while the unit's front transport wheels make it easy to move around. Proper pedal spacing on this elliptical eliminates hip fatigue--when your feet are forced out too wide or in too narrow, your body will incur undue strain on your hips. The E1 also offers a comfortable step-up height to allow you to start your workouts safely while its moving arms recruit your upper body and core to the workout, making this a total body trainer. <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="200"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/best-fit-2-full.jpg" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The E1 offers a compact footprint that's ideal for smaller spaces.</strong></em></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> To track your workout metrics, the E1 offers contact heart rate handles for advanced monitoring.

Includes helmet & one Exclusive NFL Starting Lineup Trading Card. Originally released in 1999 - Retired / Out of production. Ages 4 and up. From Hasbro.  Emmitt James Smith, III (born May 15, 1969) is a retired American football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for fifteen seasons during the 1990s and 2000s. Smith played college football for the University of Florida, where he was an All-American. A first-round pick in the 1990 NFL Draft, he played professionally for the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals of the NFL. During his long professional career, he became the NFL's all-time rushing leader, breaking the record formerly held by Walter Payton, and played for three Super Bowl-winning Dallas Cowboys teams. Smith is the only running back to ever win a Super Bowl championship, the NFL Most Valuable Player award, the NFL rushing crown, and the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award all in the same season (1993). He is also one of only four running backs to lead the NFL in rushing three or more consecutive seasons, joining Steve Van Buren, Jim Brown and Earl Campbell. Smith led the league in rushing and won the Super Bowl in the same year three times (1992, 1993, and 1995) when to that point it had never been done. Smith is also one of only two non-kickers in NFL history to score more than 1,000 career points (the other being Jerry Rice). Smith was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010, and is the first player from the 1990 NFL Draft to be inducted. While playing for the Dallas Cowboys, Smith, quarterback Troy Aikman, and wide receiver Michael Irvin were known as "The Triplets," and led their team to three Super Bowl championships during the 1990s."

The Little Buddy is backed by a limited lifetime warranty. <strong>About Planet Bike</strong><br> In November of 1996, Planet Bike was founded in Madison, Wisconsin. In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists.

The game pieces have been modeled after the main characters from the film: Manny and Ellie (both mammoths), Diego the saber-toothed tiger, and Sid the sloth. The figures are detailed, colorful, and convincing -- certain to charm fans of the movie.<P> Players begin by arranging 24 tiles in a six by four grid at the center of the board. Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play. If they're struggling with the written instructions, they can watch the easy-to-follow video tutorial on the DVD. <P> <b>Interactive DVD Keeps Game Exciting </b><br> The entire game is played alongside the interactive DVD. With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers. For this reason, it's recommended for ages 6 and up.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, game board, 24 double-sided board tiles, 5 game movers, instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL description VAL "Get your trivia game on and join Meredith Vieira as you and your friends play "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire" in your own living room.

COL description VAL "In order to make Cuba's capital citiy Havanna gleam in renewed splendor, many magnificent buildings are being built. Players can get Pesos or building materials, hire workers, bring the architect into play, collect taxes, send out thieves, hinder the construction of buildings or simply have a siesta while being protected by their body guard. Havanna stands out due to its minimal rules and its ingeniously simple mechanism that calls for different approaches each time you play. It is equally important to use intuition and rapidly find new strategies as it is to carefully plan ahead. No two games are alike, and in the end, exact timing will determine victory or defeat! In Havana you acquire victory points by constructing buildings, available as tiles displayed on the table. To take a building you must pay its requirements - some combination of money, workers and building materials. More difficult combinations yield more victory points. Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection. The game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first. So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your "half of all pesos in the middle" is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner. Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him. Other cards add different twists. What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you're aiming for, make up the game's main decisions."	COL description VAL "Ty Jingle Beanies - Goodies the Guinea Pig"	0

Roaming through vivid foliage are a pink monkey with yellow ears and nose, a giant yellow and orange frog with green eyes and green and pink spots, a pink and red striped snake, an elephant, and a tiger. The drumhead looks like (but probably isn't) real skin, and is reinforced below with a transparent plastic membrane. And the sound? Not at all bad. Variations of hand and finger action produce lots of different beats. <I>--Louise Carter</I>"	1

COL description VAL "Liquid Reactor is a complete calcium buffer system designed to give the same results as costly calcium reactor systems without investing in a reactor, CO2 tank, solenoid, and pH controller; also, there is no risk of overdosing CO2 and causing subsequent problems with algae and/or pH. This product will raise the concentrations of calcium, magnesium, strontium, and carbonates (alkalinity) in the system, and is chloride, phosphate, nitrate, and gluconate free. Each 16-Ounce of Liquid Reactor will treat 5,000-gallon or 18,900 liters and contains 126,000 ppm of calcium and 193,000 ppm carbonates. Kent Marine Liquid Reactor is an aqueous complex of calcium and carbonates; additionally, it provides magnesium, strontium and trace minerals. This material originates from ancient marine deposits that are now terrestrial (not collected from current marine environments, and so does not contribute to reef-destructive collection practices). Liquid Reactor is free of pollutants, and organics which may be present in aquatic muds of terrestrial origin. This is a simple means to dose calcium, magnesium, and carbonates to reef aquariums without the high cost, maintenance, and potential for CO2 overdosing associated with calcium reactor systems. Furthermore, hobbyists wishing to avoid addition of chloride ions to their reefs will benefit greatly from Liquid Reactor as it is chloride-free and will not cause ionic imbalance."	0

Vectra 3D uses a three pronged approach to keep your pet safe from disease carrying agents by utilizing Dinotefuran, Permethrin and Pyriproxyfen. The Dinotefuran is an insecticide that functions by causing continuous stimulation of the nervous system of insects upon first contact. This stimulation leads to tremors and quick deaths in insects as they land on your dog. Permethrin is an adulticide and works to repel vectors, such as mosquitoes, ticks and sand flies by causing them to lose control of their nervous system. Lastly, Pyripoxyfen, an insect growth regulator, works to prevent development of fleas in their early stages. This keeps them as eggs, larvae and pupae until the other active ingredients functionally decimate them. Vectra 3D has been clinically shown to provide fastacting protection against multiple pests lasting up to one month. In addition to repelling mosquitoes, ticks, and sand flies, Vectra 3D repels and kills fleas, lice, and mites quickly and effectively. In fact, it has been shown to reduce the number of ticks in only 24hours and begins killing fleas within the first two hours of use. Vectra 3D remains effective after bathing and it can be used on dogs and puppies older than 7 weeks. Vectra 3D comes in 4 dosing sizes based on your dogss body weight. The product is available for all weights in packs of 3doses and packs of 6doses. Vectra 3D Green for Dogs Puppies is intended for dogs between 2.5 and 20 pounds and this particular package comes with 3 doses. For heavier dogs, use Vectra 3D Blue, Vectra 3D Purple, or Vecra 3D Red. Vectra 3D is also available for Cats and Kittens. Please read the application instructions thoroughly before applying Vectra 3D to your pets.

COL description VAL " <b>Our Story</b> Humble Bee was founded in 2014 by us, Ahmed and Michal, while we were living in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. We got started in apiculture and learned how to raise our own beehives by attending classes organized through our local beekeeping association. With each passing season, though, we noticed there were fewer and fewer wild bees around and more and more beehives collapsing without any obvious cause. After suffering the loss of our own hives, we decided it was time to take action and help save the bees. That's why we established Humble Bee and agreed on a mission - to give back 10% of our profits to charities that encourage local beekeeping activities and promote bee conservation efforts. We want to get more people involved with beekeeping and help newcomers establish their own apiaries. Our beekeeping products are built to the highest safety and quality standards. In fact, we only sell products that we've tested and use at our own apiaries! We promise that you'll love your new Humble Bee gear as much as we do, or we'll give you a full refund - no questions asked. And, to top things off, we guarantee the caliber of all our products with a hassle-free 2-year warranty."

COL description VAL "With its ample dimensions and burly construction, this commercial 5-quart KitchenAid mixer is prepared to be a culinary beast of burden. Smartly engineered so that the beater moves clockwise while the shaft moves counterclockwise, the beater reaches every part of the bowl without requiring it to rotate. 5 mixing speeds plus a stir setting means the appliance can do everything from folding cranberries into biscotti to whipping up a fluffy meringue. The all-metal construction includes a heavy-duty motor to handle stiff batters and a hardwearing transmission that ensures continuous power. The mixers seamless, stainless-steel, 5-quart bowl stands flat on its indented base and features sealed handle and bracket connections that meet NSF standards. A professional-style bowl lift raises it easily and securely into position, even if its brimming with weighty dough. The mixer comes with a burnished flat beater, a burnished dough hook, and a commercial wire whip. The flat beater is perfect for mixing cake batters, mashing potatoes, and stirring quick breads. The dough hook comes in handy for breads and coffee cakes, and the wire whip is your tool for icings and whipped cream. 4 sealed rubber feet hold the mixer stably in place, and a 3-wire, 6-foot power cord meets commercial requirements. As a safety mechanism, the overload reset button pops out if the mixer is overloaded, and the motor shuts off. If you only bake occasionally, a less heavy-duty unit will do the job. But if you work or recreate in the kitchen, this hard-working mixer can keep the pace. <i>--Emily Bedard</i> Editors note: This is a reconditioned appliance.

Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Use the <b>Chop</b> function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the <b>Grind</b> function for grinding spices, and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover, and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Read to clean up? No problem! To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover, and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover, and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly, and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space.

COL description VAL "Messermeister, featuring premier German cutlery, has roots in both Germany and Australia. Today, Messermeister operates as a U.S. company that strives to provide thehighest quality of cutlery and culinary tools to both food-service professionals and home cooks.We are committed to designing new and innovative products and sourcing the world to find the very best quality at the right price for the market. The Park Plaza collection of stamped knives is manufactured using the finest stamped high carbon German krupp stainless steel, featuring a sharp edge and hard blade, allowing it to hold its edge for a long time. The Park Plaza collection features a triple riveted polyoxymethylene POM handle, permamently securing the handle to the full tang and providing a classic design. The riveted handle is made with impact resistant and state-of-the-art materials to withstand rigorous use. Stamped knives are noticeably lighter than forged knives, which is an attribute for those who are not comfortable with heavy knives. This Park Plaza 2-piece carving set includes an 8-inch carving knife and a 7-inch forged carving fork. The carving knife has a narrow spear pointed 7-1/2-inch fine edge blade and is used to separated meat from the bone and slice it into thin portions. The 7-inch forged carving fork features extra long prongs. Messermeister offers a guaranteed lifetime warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. Every knife comes with free lifetime sharpening and reconditioning. Once the edge is no longer sharp, have an expert sharpener re-grind a new edge on your knife or with a return shipping fee, Messermeister will re-sharpen your knife free of charge. Contact customer service at toll free800-426-5134. When carving a roast or turkey, a good knife is only half the battle. You've also got to hold the meat steady or you may slice more than the meat. For those who don't need a foot-long slicing knife to cut their small turkey or roast, this 8-inch carving knife is a nice alternative, and the 7-inch carving fork with extra-long tines will hold it still while you slice. This Messermeister Park Plaza carving set is made in Germany of a high-carbon stainless steel that combines chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium for tensile strength, hardness, and resistance to corrosion. Full-length tangs (meaning the metal blade continues all the way through to the end of the handle) give you a stronger and better balanced knife and fork. Three rivets keep the tangs attached to the black hygienic composition handles. Both the knife and fork feel substantial and balanced in your hand. Although they are dishwasher-safe, it's best to hand wash them to keep their steel scratch-free. <I>--Doree Armstrong</I>"	COL description VAL "9704 Features: -Product Care: Hand wash with mild detergent, then dry and store. -Blade material: High carbon stainless steel. -Gourmet collection. -Dishwasher not recommended. -2 Piece Carving Set. -Pieces Included: Carving knife; carving fork.

This adorable version of the classic Candy Land game features gingerbread men as movers, colored cards, and fun illustrations that kids love, with different destinations like Cookie Commons and the chunky Chocolate Mountain. Players choose their cards, move their pawns, and let their imaginations soar as they make their way to the castle to win! For 2 to 4 players. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. "Once upon a time, King Kandy, the Imperial Head Bonbon and Grand Jujube of Candy Land disappeared." Thus begins the magical journey of Milton Bradley's classic Candy Land board game. Captivated by the story of a kidnapped king and eager to help find him, little ones move their gingerbread pawns along a rainbow path and through a land of candy characters, all subjects of King Kandy's realm. <P> Playing cards thoughtfully designed for non-readers are coded with colorful squares matching the jeweled stepping-stone path or an occasional token matching one of the characters' symbols: draw a blue card, move to the nearest blue stepping-stone; draw a snowflake and earn a visit to Queen Frostine's iceberg. There are occasional pitfalls, too: land on the wrong square and you might be stuck in Molasses Swamp until a red card is drawn. With all these enticing, sugarcoated images (and King Kandy plainly visible at path's end), children can't help but be delighted by Candy Land. It's delicious! Instructions are in both Spanish and English. Candy Land is for two to four players) <i>--Julie Ubben</i>"	COL description VAL "Our Let's Go Fishin' game is the original version of a well-known and well-loved fishing game that parents will remember playing when they were kids.

The figures are detailed, colorful, and convincing -- certain to charm fans of the movie.<P> Players begin by arranging 24 tiles in a six by four grid at the center of the board. Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play. If they're struggling with the written instructions, they can watch the easy-to-follow video tutorial on the DVD. <P> <b>Interactive DVD Keeps Game Exciting </b><br> The entire game is played alongside the interactive DVD. With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers. For this reason, it's recommended for ages 6 and up.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, game board, 24 double-sided board tiles, 5 game movers, instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL description VAL "Survey says...this Family Feud DVD Game is sure to be a hit with your family and friends.

COL description VAL "Herdmar has manufactured high quality flatware since 1911 in Guimares, Portugal, home of that country's fine metals businesses for centuries. A family-owned company, they use only the best quality 18/10 stainless steel for their flatware, which gives each piece a luxurious shine, and makes it easy-care and very durable. "Oslo Black" is a very simple pattern, with tapered handles that round at the end, and the tail of each piece is curved so it is slightly raised for a stylish feel. The unique and high-style Black finish is a proprietary coating technique that permanently fuses the black coating to each piece, making the black mirror finish scratch-resistant and very durable. Each piece is a heavy gauge 3mm to 4mm thickness, and every piece is dishwasher safe. Both the place spoon and teaspoon are large sized, and the dinner knife has a solid handle and serrated cutting edge. Each piece except the knife is hallmarked "Herdmar 18/10 Portugal" on the back of the handle; the knife is marked Herdmar on the blade."	COL description VAL "Celebrate those who care for us.

Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry.

COL description VAL "The U.S.S. Constitution, a three-mast frigate, is the world's oldest commissioned warship. Built primarily with dense southern live oak, its hull was 21 inches thick in an era when 18 inches was common. Paul revere forged the copper spikes and bolts that held the planks in place. The 204-foot-long ship was first put to sea in 1798 and its most famous era of naval warfare was the war of 1812 against Britain, when it captured numerous merchant ships and defeated five warships, including the H.M.S. Guerriere. It was during the ferocious battle with the Guerriere that British seamen, astonished at how their cannonballs were bouncing off the constitution's hull, cried out, "sir, her sides are made from iron." Hence, the nickname, "old ironsides." The constitution today is a national landmark and is currently docked in Boston.This Is museum-quality, fully assembled edition of the famous USS constitution "old ironside". It is part of an exclusive edition where the hull is laser cut with a unique serial number. The model is 100% hand built from scratch using "plank on frame" construction method.

COL description VAL "Fluval Activated Carbon provides many benefits in both fresh and marine water. The high quality carbon provides a large porous area to trap minute particles. Besides providing a small sieve for mechanical trapping of organic wastes, carbon also removes liquid wastes from water. These include urine, dyes or impurities in solution. This action provides sparkling clear water in the aquarium. The large internal surface area also provides numerous points for important bacterial colonies to form and thrive. Carbon should always be removed during medication. It has also been recently noted that carbon will adsorb a large percentage of many of the nutrients in plant fertilizer products. As such, it should be used carefully when keeping live plants. Carbon loses its activity without outward sign. In general, carbon should be replaced on a monthly basis to ensure that active adsorption is maintained. <div class="aplus"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> <h5>Fluval Carbon</h5> Fluval Carbon Filter Media Insert is capable of adsorbing most liquified impurities and dyes present in aquarium water.

COL description VAL "Imagine if the ancients who invented "Go" used magnets instead of stones, and you'll be well on your way to understanding the attraction of Polarity. This game is deceptively simple to learn, but can become as delightfully complex as chess. Strategy is the key, but you'll need dexterity as well, because you don't just place the pieces, you float them. To set up the game, lay out the cloth game mat on any surface. It's best to start on an even surface, but as your skills advance you can play just about anywhere. Once the players have selected colors and split the 52 discs, each lays out five foundation pieces in a circle. After that, you place "learners", pieces that float in the air due to their repulsion of the magnetic fields. You have to be careful when you place your learner so as not to create a fault, that is to cause other pieces to flip, stick and form towers. You can capture towers to win, but if you cause faults, the towering pieces go into your unplayed stack. When one player runs out of pieces to play, the towers are counted, unplayed pieces are subtracted from the total and the player with the most pieces wins. But be careful, you can lose immediately if you touch the red disc in the center, cause it to leave the center or have no discs on the play mat with your color showing. It sounds simple, but it is simply wonderful fun, calling for both manual and mental skills. Polarity comes in a great, easy-to-carry canvas bag, with instructions and game pieces. Once you start, plan on becoming addicted. You'll want to join the online forums where beginners and experts discuss strategy, leaning and wild tales of Polarity. Get the balance right and learn to lean when you play Polarity."

COL description VAL "The Hospitality Pineapple Door Knocker is cast in Solid Brass and designed by Michael Healy, an accomplished Rhode Island artisan. Brass and bronze are copper-based alloys. The yellow brass alloy used in many of Michael's designs contains 70-percent copper and produces a warm, traditional brass look. Red bronze contains almost 85-percent copper. This additional copper content gives the bronze alloy its rich, reddish undertone. The mirrored finish of polished brass and polished bronze is achieved through varying degrees of sanding and buffing. Michael uses these techniques to highlight or accent the raised areas on a piece. The Pineapple is a traditional symbol of abundant hospitality, making it an ideal image for your home's front door."	1
COL description VAL "Wag More Bark Less Auto Car Refrigerator MAGNET"	COL description VAL "Fry with style and grace, and stop worrying about which cooktop you're using with this flexible and high quality frying pan by All-Clad. Near perfect in design, the pan is constructed of three layers of metal; two stainless steel outer layers with an aluminum core. The stainless steel exterior combined with the aluminum core allows the pan to be used on all types of stovetops, including induction, and heats the pan evenly to eliminate hot spots. Additionally, the pan has a non-stick coating which makes food removal and clean-up a breeze. The classically sloped sides help prevent messes, and when you're finished cooking, the pan can be hung through the handle's eyelet for convenient storage. Producing some of the finest cookware in the nation, All-Clad has been featured in many high class and gourmet restaurants for its superior performance and aesthetically designed pieces crafted from American artists using the finest metals. A firm believer in quality over convenience, All-Clad's metals are formulated and bonded with cooking performance in mind, and are combined with stunning designs to provide you with the best cooking experience possible. The bestseller among All-Clad's renowned cookware collections, the Stainless line provides serious and professional cooks all the virtues that make All-Clad's worldwide reputation unsurpassed. Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the steel. This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 10 inches in diameter, perfect for cooking tuna or tofu, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for a healthful meal. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's heat. Although Stainless cookware is dishwasher-safe, nonstick pieces should be hand washed. <i>--Fred Brack</i> <b>From the Manufacturer</b> <br> <b>All-Clad Stainless Construction</b> <br> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cookware/allclad.stainless.gif" width="244" height="129" align="left"> Each piece of All-Clad cookware features a unique metal bonding construction. All-Clad Stainless cookware sandwiches a thick core of three separate layers of aluminum between an easy-to-clean, highly polished 18/10 stainless-steel cooking surface and a magnetic stainless-steel exterior. The aluminum core retains heat and evenly distributes it along the bottom and up the sidewalls of the cookware. The stainless interior is stick-resistant and cleans easily. The magnetic stainless-steel exterior gives the cookware a gleaming finish. All-Clad Stainless also features the company&#x92;s signature "stay-cool" long handles, lids fashioned from gleaming 18/10 stainless steel, and highly durable stainless-steel rivets. All-Clad Stainless cookware is one of five collections from All-Clad Metalcrafters. Designed to work on conventional gas and electric ranges, as well as induction cooktops, All-Clad Stainless cookware is the best-selling collection in a full line that includes All-Clad LTD, Cop-R-Chef, Master Chef 2, and Copper Core. <b>Features and Benefits</b> <br> All-Clad pans with a stainless interior cooking surface are oven-safe up to 500 degrees. All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include: <ul> <li>Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer. <li>Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you won&#x92;t have "hot spots" when cooking.  <li>Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface. <li>Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles. <li>Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods. <li>Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pan&#x92;s edges to seal in flavor of your foods. <li>The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops.  <li>The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface. </ul> <b>Warranty</b> <br> From date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal. <b>Cleaning Instructions</b> <br> For daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend to remove it.  <b>All-Clad Stainless Selection</b> <br> In recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

Dental Fresh Original Formula is truly the world&rsquo;s first toothbrush in a bottle for your cat. Adding Dental Fresh to your cat&rsquo;s water bowl daily equates to brushing their teeth every time they drink water &ndash; without the struggles and hassles that most pet parents have had when trying to use a toothbrush on an unwilling cat. Dental Fresh is the only clinically-proven formula for cat oral health providing multiple benefits: cleans and whitens teeth, freshens breath, protects gums while treating gingivitis, prevents periodontal disease, and improves overall dental health.<br /> <br /> When cats develop dental disease, it can lead to additional problems throughout their body. That is why it is so important to recognize the signs of dental issues in your cat &ndash; bad breath, yellow or brown teeth, swollen, inflamed, red, puffy gums, weight loss, and poor appetite &ndash; and prioritize oral health. Dental Fresh makes that incredibly easy. <br /> <br /> Our clinically-proven water additive features a unique self-regulating formula that activates, releases and destroys bad breath causing germs and bacteria microorganisms only when exposed to bacteria, periodontal pathogens, and acidic areas where plaque has formed. The more &ldquo;issues&rdquo; present, the stronger the formula works for your cat. And, in turn, the less &ldquo;issues&rdquo; present, the less the formula targets those areas. All of the cats (and dogs!) in your household can safely drink from the same water bowl because each pet will receive a different dosage of the active ingredient, depending on their individual dental needs. And unlike many water bowl additives on the market, Dental Fresh contains no alcohol, no sugar, no surfactants or detergents, and no pungent mint flavors. It does not cause staining, has no taste or artificial flavorings, and can be safely used long-term. Dental Fresh Original Formula for Cats is available in an 8-fluid ounce bottle.<br /> <br /> We know that your cats are more than just pets - they are part of the family - so Dental Fresh designs premium oral health products that pet parents can actually afford. Your cat will have fresher breath, whiter teeth, and healthier gums and you will feel confident knowing that you are being proactive with your cat&rsquo;s oral health &ndash; making you both happy and able to focus on more important things like naps, games and snuggles."	1

With a patented reversible blade for sharp or blunt processing, and two speeds of operation, it is well equipped to handle a variety of jobs. <P>Though it has a high-speed motor and durable stainless-steel motor shaft, keep in mind that the Mini-Mate is designed for small amounts of food: 2 tablespoons is the maximum recommended for one batch, and food pieces should be no larger than 1/2 inch. Purchase it to complement, not replace, a larger, full-function food processor. An instruction book that accompanies the processor details how to process many common foods and troubleshoot problems so you know how to best use and care for your Mini Mate. <P>Cleanup and completion of small jobs is quicker and more efficient because of the small size, though the many parts of the Mini Mate require disassembly, careful cleaning, and reassembly, which does add to total cleaning time. If you don't have the time or the patience for smaller detail-oriented prep jobs, Mini Mate is a great kitchen aid. <I>--Emily Wolf</I>"	COL description VAL "Powerful Stainless Steel Chopper/Grinder, 21 OZ Work Bowl, 2 Speeds, Reversible Blade, Brushed Stainless Base, Dishwasher Safe Parts, Spatula, Instruction Book. The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>"	1

COL description VAL "Position your POLYGON quot;tilesquot; to create a scoring combination. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game WINS! IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Contents: * Folding Game Board * One Die * 49 Polygon Tiles * Game Instructions * 50 Score Cards There's good news and bad news about this board game for two to four players. It's fun to play. It provides useful practice of addition and multiplication facts. It requires strategizing to decide how to play on each turn. That's the good news. The bad news is that the rules are rather difficult to figure out, even for an adult. But keep trying--it's a rewarding and educational game after all. Polygon uses numbered tiles that are placed on the game board in ways that achieve a score for each turn. You can play tiles in several ways so you have to add (and sometimes multiply, too) on each turn, as well as at the end of the game. Polygon is a subtle way to practice those math facts painlessly, so it's a good choice for elementary age kids from third through fifth grades. <I>--Marcie Bovetz</I>"	COL description VAL "Have you heard - Word's out?

Genuine Replacement Part."	COL description VAL " A great starter set for anyone setting up a first-time kitchen, this seven-piece block set provides an array of useful everyday knives. The collection consists of a 4-inch paring knife, a 6-1/2-inch utility knife, an 8-inch chef's knife, and a 9-inch bread knife, as well as a honing steel, a pair of kitchen shears, and a knife block to keep everything neatly organized. Overall, the knife set measures 14-3/5 by 5 by 12 inches. As part of Shun's Premier line, the each knife features a VG10 steel blade, clad with 32 layers of stainless Damascus, then beveled for lateral stability and incredible precision. The hand-hammered finish not only adds intriguing visual appeal, but it also creates a hollow-ground surface, which reduces knife-drag when cutting and prevents food from sticking to the blade. The knives also come equipped with premium Pakkawood handles in a walnut finish, which offer a comfortable, secure grip. As a sleek and stylish finishing touch, Shun embossed its logo on the end cap of the knives' handles. The high-quality knives can safely go in the dishwasher, but for best results, washing them by hand and letting them air dry is recommended. The knife set carries a limited lifetime warranty. Calling to mind the handcrafting techniques of ancient Japan, the Shun Premier possesses the grace and beauty of hand-forged knives of old. Every blade is made of VG10 steel, clad with stainless Damascus, then ground for lateral stability and incredible precision. Where the steels meet, a wavy line called a Hamon is formed--similar to when samurai swords are tempered using a clay-baking technique. The striking hammered finish ("Tsuchime" in Japanese) acts as a series of hollow-ground cavities, reducing drag when cutting as well as quickly releasing food from the blade. The rich walnut PakkaWood handles nestle comfortably in the hand, and the Shun logo embossed on the bottom adds balance and beauty to the knife, whether in the hand or at rest in the block. Kasumi is a traditional Japanese style of knifemaking in which an extremely hard core of high-carbon steel is clad--that is, sheathed or covered--with an exterior jacket of another steel. The somewhat "softer" exterior cladding protects the inner cutting core. In Japanese, kasumi means "mist" and is so called because the exterior steel can have a lovely misty appearance when compared to the harder cutting core. Kasumi construction provides an ultimate mix of properties: an extremely sharp edge and ease of sharpening. This clad construction is similar to how samurai swords are traditionally made. In Japanese, Tsuchime (Tsoo-CHEE-may) simply means "hammered". It does two things: gives the knife a look that is reminiscent of the handcrafting techniques of ancient Japan; and creates tiny pockets of air that act as hollow-ground cavities to reduce drag and quickly release food from the blade. Shun's gorgeous new Premier line features a hand-hammered tsuchime blade finish. Many Shun cutlery lines are characterized by the beautiful Damascus patterning on the blades. In Japan, this is also known as suminigashi, or ink pattern, because of its resemblance to the undulating patterns made by ink in water. To create this style of blade, a cutting core of VG10 is clad on each side with 16 layers of Damascus steel, made up of SUS410 and SUS431 stainless steel. Then the blades are bead-blasted to reveal the elegant, waved pattern. In addition to its beauty, the Damascus has two purposes. First, it protects and supports the extremely hard cutting core. Second, it helps the blade glide through food even more smoothly. You will find Damascus cladding on knives in our Classic, Ken Onion, and Premier series. PakkaWood is a premium handle material made of genuine hardwood impregnated with resin. The resin makes it moisture resistant, strong, and durable. Sanding and buffing brings PakkaWood to a beautiful gloss finish. As with natural wood, no two pieces of PakkaWood are exactly alike."	0

Made in Solingen, Germany, home of W&#xFC;sthof since 1814, Gourmet blades are precision-cut by laser from sheets of high-carbon, stain-resistant steel, resulting in a slightly thinner profile and lighter weight than the company's revered forged steel blades. There is no bolster, but there is a full-tang. As with the more expensive W&#xFC;sthof Classic knives, Gourmet handles are made of a triple-riveted, black composite shaped to fit the hand comfortably. Gourmet series knives make excellent, affordable gifts for any home cooking enthusiast.

COL description VAL "The second expansion for The Lord of the Rings board game adds a whole new dimension to the game play. With the Sauron expansion, the fellowship of Hobbits are no longer competing solely against the game and its boards. In Sauron one player takes on the role of the dark lord and seeks to thwart the fellowship's crucial mission. Okay look, we've all seen the movies, many of us have read the books, and plenty of us have already played the incredibly cool <I>Lord of the Rings</I> board game designed by Reiner Knizia. And while the determined pluck of the hobbits is obviously worthy of admiration, haven't you ever thought there was something kind of cool about Sauron? Sure you might not want to admit it, or maybe you do, but the guy is in at least a partially sympathetic spot. He just wants to rule all of creation and to do that, all he needs to do is pry some jewelry away from a hobbit. With this Sauron expansion set to the original board game, players can get their chance to play the bad guy himself, employ the Black Rider, and rule them all. But beware: with this set, the pesky hobbits have some new weapons of their own. The set includes 30 Sauron cards, nine Nazgul cards, and five Fellowship cards. It's not capable of being played on its own but makes a great counterpart, and counterpoint, to the original board game. <I>--Charlie Williams</I>"	COL description VAL "Every detail is authentic, richly realistic and true to the Academy Award winning epic film.

COL description VAL "Chop onions, pepper, and more with this vegetable knife from Global. This knife is made from a single piece of high quality CROMOVA 18 stainless steel with a square tip and an ultra sharp blade. The ice tempered, convex edge can hold a sharper edge for a longer time so you can slice vegetables and make a delicious bowl of pasta primavera. It has an ergonomic handle with a dimple pattern making it comfortable and slip resistant, useful for repetitive slicing. The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. This knife can be used in place of a Santoku knife so you can also cut meats and fruits. 5-1/2" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 5-1/2-inch knife for precisely slicing and chopping vegetables is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges.

COL description VAL "IO52C Features: -Product Type:Brush / Comb. Dimensions: -Overall Product Weight:10.2 We all know that cats dislike water, but many dogs are also skittish when it comes to baths, running and hiding at the first drip from the hose. Unfortunately, that doesnt stop pets from getting into the garbage, rolling in the dirt (or worse), or tangling with wild critters. Lenteks waterless pet bath brush provides an alternative to the traditional bath. Pets relax for a brushing session--something most animals do like--as the pet brush soundlessly circulates 100 trillion air-cleansing ions per second through the animals fur to remove even the nastiest odors. Operating via one 9-volt battery (not included), a flashing green light indicates that the brush is on, while a red light warns that the battery is getting low on power. One complete brushing cycle lasts 5 minutes before the tool automatically shuts off. The bath brush has soft plastic bristles, and additional heads--with either plastic or metal bristles--are sold separately. <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>"	COL description VAL "The Chris Christensen Purple Ionic Brass and Nylon brushes are made with solid brass inner bristles to distribute natural oils.

The high quality carbon provides a large porous area to trap minute particles. Besides providing a small sieve for mechanical trapping of organic wastes, carbon also removes liquid wastes from water. These include urine, dyes or impurities in solution. This action provides sparkling clear water in the aquarium. The large internal surface area also provides numerous points for important bacterial colonies to form and thrive. Carbon should always be removed during medication. It has also been recently noted that carbon will adsorb a large percentage of many of the nutrients in plant fertilizer products. As such, it should be used carefully when keeping live plants. Carbon loses its activity without outward sign. In general, carbon should be replaced on a monthly basis to ensure that active adsorption is maintained. <div class="aplus"> <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Hagen/fluvalexpanded._V347497123_.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> <h5>Fluval Carbon</h5> Fluval Carbon Filter Media Insert is capable of adsorbing most liquified impurities and dyes present in aquarium water.

COL description VAL "Curved blade with holes slips through cheese without blade sticking. Blade made of high-tech molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel. Stainless-steel handle molded for Comfort, dimpled for safe grip. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this cheese knife is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. This 5-1/2-inch knife has holes in its blade so it slips through medium-firm and firm cheeses without sticking. The edge is ground on only one side and is both finely serrated and scalloped for cutting through rinds. Prongs on the end pick up slices for serving. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation.

Please read this section before using your cookware for the first time. The information it contains will help you achieve the best possible cooking results. Enameled cast iron is a remarkable and robust material that performs well with modern requirements for food preparation and cooking. Whether you choose to stir-fry, slow-cook a casserole, sear a steak or bake a cake, there is a shape that is suitable. Cast iron performs well for either slow cooking or high-temperature searing. Cast iron can be used reliably on any heat source, including induction, and with any oven or grill. It has the ability to retain heat efficiently, which allows for use of lower heat settings in stovetop and oven cooking. On the table, a hot covered dish will keep food hot for second servings. Cast iron can also be used to keep foods cold. A chilled dish becomes an ideal cold food server on a hot summer day. It can also be placed in the freezer for food storage or advanced food preparation. The vitreous enamel surface is impermeable and therefore ideal for raw or cooked food storage, and for marinating with acidic ingredients such as wine. Grills may be preheated to reach a hot surface temperature for searing and caramelization. This advice does not apply to any other products. For correct grilling and searing, it is important that the cooking surface is sufficiently hot before cooking begins. Sear lines from ribbed grills will not be produced if the pan surface is too cool, or if the food is too wet. Place the empty pan on medium heat and allow it to heat for several minutes. Do not add oil to the cold pan -- the oil may become too hot and smoke. Take a few drops of water on your fingers and scatter over the hot surface. If they sizzle and evaporate almost immediately it is hot and ready for use. If the water produces steam and has no sizzle, heat the pan a little longer and repeat the water test again. When the surface is hot enough, lightly oil it with cooking spray or brush it with oil using a Le Creuset silicone basting brush. Vegetable, ground nut or corn oils are recommended. Olive oil may cause excessive smoking. Once a patina covers the cooking surface very little oil will be necessary. For distinct sear lines, leave the food undisturbed on the surface for several minutes. If the food is moved too quickly the lines will be poor, and steam from the food may be released onto the surface. Any food for grilling or searing must be quite dry before it is placed on the hot surface. Wet foods will not achieve good sear lines and may result in a steamed appearance and flavor. Use paper towels to pat off excess moisture from foods. Oil can then be brushed over the food if desired. Foods that have been marinated should also have excess moisture removed with paper towels. By squaring this skillet and flaring its sides, famed French cookware manufacturer Le Creuset offers extra cooking room for steaks, fish, burgers, or any food that benefits from stovetop grilling and the caramelized flavor imparted by seared grill marks. The raised ribs in the grill's bottom not only provide those marks but also help excess fat and grease drain away from food for lower-calorie cooking. Because cast iron is unmatched for heat retention and even heat distribution (no hot spots), foods will cook uniformly in the 10-1/4-inch-square grill. The unit's exterior provides a colorful, long-lasting enamel that resists chipping and cracking, while its inside offers a durable black enamel finish (no seasoning required). The grill also provides a sturdy, integrated handle with an opposite helper handle for secure transport, as well as dual nondrip spouts--one on each side to accommodate left- and right-handed pouring. Even more, the grill works on any stovetop, in the oven, or under a broiler. It's also stylish enough (think French farmhouse kitchen) to bring to the table. Though it's dishwasher-safe, hand washing preserves a patina that builds up with use and aids in the grill's stick resistance. The skillet grill measures approximately 11-3/4 by 16-3/4 by 2 inches and carries a limited lifetime warranty. <i>--Fred Brack</i>"	0

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again.

Where other companies look to hired help for their "knowledge", standing on the shoulders of giants, Lynn and his team invested their own blood, sweat and tears, endlessly sparring with different prototypes looking for ways to improve upon this already near perfect design. Lynn recognized that many of the qualities that make a great fighting knife also make a great bushcraft tool. A sharp blade, strong tip, good hand protection and a versatile handle are all key. Stripping the Kukri back to its bare basics he then began re-designing the knife from the ground up. The re-imagined blade was presented at an entirely new angle, keeping the cutting power that made the Kukri the stuff of legend, but increasing its thrusting and piercing power. The handle with its integral guard kept the user's precious digits safe from harm while changing the balance and heft of the knife considerably. The newly christened Royal Kukri was then extensively field-tested. Proving to be an outstanding multi-functional bush knife. Capable of the toughest bushcraft chores, from chopping firewood to dispatching wounded game, it also provided the comfort of a last resort self defense opt(more.)."	0

The water level indicator on the outside of this machine is magnified for easy reading and the carafe is sturdy and pours easily. This coffeemaker also has a "Stop 'n' Serve" feature that lets you pour yourself a cup while the java's still brewing. If there's one feature that will divide people though, it's the machine's design. The ovoid carafe and enclosing stand will be handsome to some, while others won't like them or the extra counter depth they take up. <I>--Maria Dolan</I>"	COL description VAL "The Cuisinart brew Central 12 cup programmable coffeemaker makes a bold statement in any kitchen With a brushed metal finish and elegant tech-industrial design.

All the features of the NE 2000, but cordless to maximize floor space. Experience a full-body, low-impact workout with the Nautilus NE3000 elliptical trainer, a gym-quality machine that keeps you in top shape year round. The NE3000 is outfitted with the company's patented SyncLink technology, which features articulating foot platforms that track the natural movement of your feet through elliptical motion. This creates a more comfortable, authentic workout that won't put undue stress on your knees, ankles, or joints. The trainer is also remarkably quiet and smooth thanks to the frictionless V-Force Plus system, which delivers a wide range of resistance levels, and the commercial-grade Poly-V belt drive system, which teams near-silent operation with maintenance-free performance. Need feedback on your workout? Turn to the LED display, which makes it easy to see your workout progress at a glance, with feedback on your total workout time, distance, calories burned, average speed, RPM, and heart rate. The NE3000 also offers seven preprogrammed workouts, two custom programs, and multiple heart rate control programs. The latter programs monitor your heart rate (contact sensors and wireless telemetry heart-rate belt included) and automatically adjust the intensity level of your workout based on your target zone. As a bonus, the trainer offers a Remote Operation Control (ROC) system built into the arm handles, letting you start and change the intensity level without moving your hands. Other details include a cordless, self-generating resistance system (meaning you can place the NE3000 anywhere); 20 workout levels; and a 350-pound weight capacity.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. <strong>About Nautilus</strong><br> Nautilus, Inc. is a pure fitness company that provides the tools and education necessary to help people achieve a fit and healthy lifestyle. With a brand portfolio that includes Nautilus, Bowflex, Schwinn Fitness, StairMaster, and PEARL iZUMi, Nautilus manufactures and markets a complete line of innovative health and fitness products through direct, commercial, specialty retail, retail, and international channels.

COL description VAL "Classical styling and state-of-the-art technology in blade manufacturing combine to create the Twin Pro S series. Each blade uses the precision SIGMAFORGE construction and is made from the J.A. Henckels exclusive formula high carbon, no-stain steel that is precision-hand honed to stay sharper for longer, and have a more consistent blade angle. The steel is hardened using the patented Friodur ice hardening system for maximum no-stain properties and excellent blade strength because of the improved resistance to corrosion and pitting. The triple riveted Novodur handles lay on the fully visible tang, giving the knife proper balance and greater strength. The most important elements of a meat cleaver are the weight and balance. A large and heavy blade is ideal to help cut and split bones, and chop through joints of uncooked, unprepared meats and poultry.

With the recognition of superior craftsmanship and quality, Henckels has expanded from cutlery to produce an assortment of cutlery-related products including scissors and shears, kitchen gadgets and tools, steak knives, wood accessories, cookware and flatware. 6" L This 6-inch professional-grade cleaver is an exceptionally strong, fine tool for chopping through bones and joints in meat.

The name is synonymous with quality, and this cleaver holds to the company's high standards. It is forged of high-carbon no-stain steel and offers an ice-hardened, laser-controlled edge. While well balanced, it feels heavy, which is a definite benefit in a knife that must hack through tough sinew and bone.

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM "tent cities" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, Eurekas new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition. For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Womens Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian. <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

Made with premium grade, Hydra-Shield, 100% cotton duck canvas. The tight weave and silicone finish make the canvas watertight yet breathable, minimizing condensation and mugginess. Go ahead and touch the inside walls during a downpourthis canvas will not wick water. The Flex-Bow frame has tempered, spring steel rods that keep the tent taut, and robust 1-inch steel tube poles that will hold up to fierce winds. The floor is a seamless, heavy-duty, puncture resistant, 16 oz vinyl that keeps water out. Easy, one-person setup takes only a few minutes after you have it staked out. The steep walls and 66 high ceiling provide a roomy interior with stand-up, walk-around comfort. Large front and back doors with top rated #10 YKK zippers give convenient access. Four windows, and two vents allow ample air flow. Windows and vents have no-see-um screen mesh, keeping out the smallest bugs. A customizable gear loft and organizer system offer plenty of places to stow gear. A large awning provides shade and a covered entry. The handy strap-and-cinch storage bag means no cramming a tent into an undersized bag. Hefty 12-inch steel stakes included. Whether you're heading to the campground with the family or the elk camp with your hunting buddies, the rugged, all-season Kodiak Canvas Flex-Bow eight-person tent is well suited to the occasion. The Flex-Bow tent is made of a superior, marine-grade, 100-percent cotton duck Hydra-Shield canvas. The custom-woven, treated canvas is ideal for tents, as the double-fill design is strong and durable, while the silicone, dry-finish treatment is watertight, breathable, and durable. As a result, campers will stay comfortable and dry even in a downpour. Unlike synthetic fabrics or canvas with a paraffin- or oil-based treatment, Kodiak's canvas allows water vapor to escape, minimizing condensation, humidity, and mugginess. Plus, you'll rarely--if ever--have to retreat Kodiak canvas. The Flex-Bow frame is every bit as strong, with 1-inch galvanized steel tubing and 3/8-inch Flex-Bow spring steel rods keeping the tent taut at all times. To further improve ventilation, the tent includes two funnel-flow vents that circulate air and assist with temperature management. And campers won't feel claustrophobic thanks to the tent's spacious 6-foot 6-inch ceiling height, two large D-shaped doors (front and back), and four large windows, all covered with no-see-um mesh. Other details include a 16-ounce, polyester-reinforced vinyl floor; a large 84-by-78-inch awning; a customizable gear loft and organizer pockets; and a handy strap-and-cinch storage bag. The Flex-Bow, which sets up easily with one person, is designed for year-round use, but isn't suitable for extreme winter mountaineering or heavy snow accumulations. <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="300"> <tbody><tr><td><img align="top" border="0" height="214" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/detail-pages/B001NZWQ1C-1.jpg" width="300" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The Flex-Bow's spacious footprint sleeps up to 8 people.</strong></em></small></td></tr></tbody></table> <b>Specifications</b><br> <ul> <li>Capacity: 8 people <li>Ceiling material: 10-ounce Hydra-Shield canvas <li>Wall material: 8.5-ounce Hydra-Shield canvas <li>Floor material: 16-ounce polyester-reinforced vinyl with welded seams <li>Frame: 1-inch galvanized steel tubing <li>Rods: 3/8-inch solid spring steel Flex-Bow rods <li>Tent dimensions: 10 by 14 feet <li>Ceiling height: 6 feet 6 inches <li>Pack weight: 79 pounds (includes stakes weighing 6.5 pounds total) <li>Pack size: 30 by 16 inches, with pole bundle measuring 48 inches long and 5.5 inches in diameter <li>Warranty: Limited lifetime warranty </ul> <b>About Kodiak Canvas</b><br> Born in the ruggedness of the Rockies, Kodiak Canvas has quickly earned a reputation for making tough, long-lasting tents ideal for almost any camping scenario.

Each DK1100 machine is built with industrial grade motors that provide the power to run day after day quickly, quietly, and reliably in even the most high production environments. The DK1100 FE is a floor-standing electric, fully-automatic pocket hole boring machine. 110VAC is required to power the drill spindle of the machine and 100 psi of air pressure is needed to cycle the hold-down clamp and forward motion cylinder. The DK1100 series features a reliable, one-step drilling operation through a hardened steel drill guide to produce the pocket hole. The hole is round sided with a flat bottom that allows a screw head to seat flushly in the bottom of the pocket and the hole to be plugged with wooden dowel.

COL description VAL "Make fresh California rolls with the left handed Yanagi Sashimi knife from Global. This knife is made from a single piece of high quality CROMOVA 18 stainless steel. One side is flat while the other is angled for the comfort of left handed people. The ice hardened, convex edge can hold a sharp edge for a long time. It has an ergonomic handle with a dimple pattern making it comfortable and slip resistant, useful for repetitive slicing. The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. Preparing sashimi or sushi is made effortless with the long flat blade that makes precision cutting easier. 10" L"	COL description VAL "GLOBAL has razorsharp straight edge sharpened by hand at a 15% angle. Thinner blades for lighter weight giving you more agility with less fatigue. Perfect balance using a weighted hollow handle. No bolster design allowing for full edge use and full-blade sharpening. All stainless steel construction with slip free handle. High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges are also ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 10-inch Sashimi slicer is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. And unlike the traditional one-sided sharpened Sashimi knives, this two-side knife, which is ideal for thinly slicing fish and sushi rolls, can be used for both right and left handed chefs. Global also did away with bolsters on its original knives to reduce the weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as the blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between the blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges, and they carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <i>--Fred Brack</i>"	1

COL description VAL "Dyson DC07 upright vacuum cleaner with patented Root8Cyclone technology has double the suction of other vacuums. Tests show Dyson's suction is double after 10 ounces of dust. Others lose suction - the more you use them, the less they work. Designed by engineering guru James Dyson, inventor of the cyclonic vacuum, the 12-amp Dyson DC07 upright is an inspired combination of power and structural smarts. At the center of the machine's innovation is the Cyclone air path design, an eight-section chamber that creates powerful, consistent suction. The conical chambers generate 100,000 g of centrifugal force, pushing dust and dirt out of the airflow into the vacuum's 1-gallon collection cup. With no bag to clog, the vacuum's 270 air watts of suction remain steady. The large, transparent collection cup is easy to check and empties tidily--pop it off, hold it over a trash bin, and pull the trigger to release dirt without having to touch it. The DC07 also comes equipped with a multipart filtration system to improve overall air quality in the home. The HEPA filter, measuring 412 square inches in surface area, traps microscopic particulates and allergens. Expertly built, the filter is designed to last the lifetime of the machine. Furthermore, Dyson upright vacuums are the first and only vacuums certified asthma friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation. Suitable for bare floors and carpets, the Dyson upright features a 14-inch cleaning path and edge-cleaning bristles. A simple foot pedal switches off the brush roll for bare floors, and the nozzle automatically adjusts for changes in carpet height. The vacuum is equipped for above-floor cleaning with a cleverly stowed, quick-release 17-foot hose with a reversible, extension-wand handle. Onboard accessories include a crevice tool, a dusting brush, and an upholstery attachment, all designed to function without "sticking" to surfaces. Made from the same material used in crash helmets, the vacuum is unquestionably durable. Plus, the design only puts 4 pounds of weight on the handle, so pushing and turning is easy. This model comes with a 35-foot power cord and a five -year warranty. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>"	0

It's "One--two--three--Go!" and everyone is racing to pop all four of their bugs into Fido's bloomers. It's that simple. Plastic "ants" are big enough (2.5 inches) that even little fingers find it easy to perform feats of insect trajectory. A hilarious hit with the shorter set. <i>--Julie Ubben</i>"	0

Premium chews with the irresistible combination of real chicken breast jerky. Wrapped in the highest quality smoked pork rawhide. Helps promote healthy teeth by preventingtartar build-up. Guaranteed Analysis:80%, Crude Fat (Min)  In the 1990's, the Dingo brand started with a man named Les and his dog, Dingo. Like most dogs, Dingo had an instinctual need to chew, and to his owner's dismay, Dingo enjoyed gnawing on furniture and destroying shoes. In hopes of fixing Dingo's behavioral problems, Les attempted replacing shoes with rawhide bones. Unfortunately, Dingo was not a fan of these traditional rawhide chews. Rather than giving up hope, Les searched for an alternate solution. Coincidentally, Les's wife worked for a jerky company, and Dingo loved the jerky treats. Due to Dingo's adoration of the jerky, Les began soaking the traditional rawhide bones in water and filling them with jerky, leaving some jerky around the edges for Dingo to see. And with that, the Dingo bone was born. Finally, Dingo had a treat that he loved, while still being able to fulfill his chewing needs. Now your dog can enjoy the original Dingo chew in the form of mini bones. The traditional rawhide bone is a durable, edible bone that serves as a common treat for dogs. With the Dingo Mini Packs, dogs reap the dental benefits of teeth cleansing and gum conditioning, while also enjoying the meaty flavor that the Dingo bone ensures. Because all Dingo bones are hand tied with real meat in the middle, they provide the highest quality treat for your dog. This treat is both easily digestible and soft enough not to damage dogs' teeth, making it a safe and healthy bone that your dog will love. In 1997, the Dingo brand was granted a patent for the single most logical improvement on the rawhide dog chew in thirty years. Due to its meat in the middle quality, the Dingo bone is the only product of its kind on the market. This allows dogs to experience a unique treat that's innovation and uniqueness separates it from traditional rawhide bones. Although competitors have attempted to mimic the Dingo bone, no other product combines rawhide with real meat in the middle to create a longer-lasting treat that encourages your dog to chew through the entire bone. Dingo comes in different shapes, flavors and functional forms:   "	0

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for 19th-century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. The company even fabricated and erected a series of IBM "tent cities" just outside Binghamton, housing thousands of IBM salesmen during the company's annual stockholders meeting, which had outgrown its previous locale. With the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, renowned explorer Sir Edmund Hillary used Eureka's new and innovative Draw-Tite tent--with its practical, freestanding external frame--in a Himalayan expedition to Nepal (Hillary had climbed to the summit of Mt. Everest only six years earlier). In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants during the first all-American Mt. Everest Expedition, where explorers braved fierce 60-plus mph winds and temperatures reached below -20F. Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s, targeting it to backpackers and families. The first to employ the StormShield design, the lightweight, self-supporting backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents in the industry, with sales reaching over 1 million by its 10-year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as companions on other historic expeditions, including the American Women's Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent years, Eureka designed and donated tents to Eric Simonson and his team. The group took two historic research expeditions to Mt. Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history by finding the remains of George Mallory, but the overall mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found several historical artifacts that are now on display at the Smithsonian. <br> <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all-purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in. If you're a backpacker, alpine climber, or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to use something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall, and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three-season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproof camping. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four-season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types: freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floorplan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one- and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it with less weight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering."	COL description VAL "A great innovation in game processing and cleaning equipment.

COL description VAL "Made by Stamps by Impression in Lewes, DE, USA. Each rubber stamp begins as an artists drawing. Much of the text is created with computer graphic software. The artwork is then reproduced on a magnesium plate. From this plate a matrix board mold is created. The stamp gum is vulcanized or cooked in the mold at 325 degrees under enormous pressure to form the rubber stamp die. The rubber is then affixed to a special cushion then carefully cut out. The cushioned die is then mounted onto a white maple block which is indexed with a clear vinyl label. - Stamps by Impression - "Craft Made in Small Batches since 1986" Stamps by Impression was born from my father's love for his wife and family.

Throw a set into your picnic basket for on-the-spot seasoning that doesn't take up valuable space.

The SteelPro takes the guesswork and intimidation out of sharpening, yet still uses the preferred steel method instead of abrasives to create a super-sharp edge. By drawing a blade alternately through one slot then another in the SteelPro approximately ten times, the edge develops micro-serrations that cut food exceptionally well. The guides maintain an angle of approximately 23 degrees. Professional sharpening will still be required periodically in the life of a high-quality knife. Clever design features make this device a pleasure to use. Using a coin, the tops of the two miniature steels can be loosened and the steels rotated when a fresh surface is required. However, the steel is so hard that several thousand strokes are needed to dull it even slightly. The sure-grip handle is comfortable for either left- or right-handed users, and a ring allows the sharpener to be hung. The glossy, chrome-look base is actually a durable plastic but looks smart in the modern kitchen and stays put during use thanks to small rubber feet. Not for use with scissors, serrated knives, or ceramic knives, the SteelPro is covered by a one-year warranty and measures 7 by 2 by 2-3/4 inches. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>"	0

The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder?

Elk naturally shed their antlers after the rut typically starting in Late October and continuing through the winter. Our Antlers are foraged, pressure washed, and cutup. No additional processing is needed. These all-natural chews are a great natural renewable source of Calcium, Phosphorus, Manganese and Zinc. Antlers are one of the most easily digested forms of calcium available and are regularly consumed by the wildlife including rabbits, squirrels, skunk and mink. Since our antlers are never farm raised these antler never contain steroids, antibiotics, preservatives or any artificial additives. It is important to properly size our antler products to your dog and your pets overall desire to chew. Our Elk Rack Snacks are considered the premier antler on the market today due to the superior density of the antler. Elk antlers do not tend to chip or splinter like some cooked and raw bones do. Given this above average density, we sell our antlers based on overall size and not by weight to ensure that you get maximum value for your money. Additionally, we never cut our antlers in half, as this too can compromise the integrity and durability of the antler. Elk antler is your best choice for the most aggressive chewing dogs regardless of size. Elk Rack Antler Dog Chew 100-percent naturally shed antlers from the USA"	COL description VAL "pH is the measure of acidity of water, on a scale ranging from 0 to 14. A pH of 0 is the most acidic, while a pH of 14 is the most alkaline. Different geographies have different tap water conditions with different pH levels, while fish require a specific pH level to thrive. A pH of 7.0 is ideal when keeping a community aquarium containing a variety of tropical fish. Goldfish and livebearers prefer a pH of 7.5. Many Amazonian fish, like angelfish and neon tetras, prefer a pH of 6.5 to 6.8. Mollies and swordtails thrive at pH 7.2 to 7.5. API pH UP Freshwater Aquarium Water pH Raising Solution raises aquarium pH in freshwater aquariums to desired level. Safe for fish and plants. Use when setting up a new aquarium, adjusting pH, or changing water. pH in an aquarium can fluctuate due to fish waste, uneaten food and addition of tap water.

COL description VAL "There isn't really a good substitute for a cleaver when you need to cut through bones or thick cuts of beef. They tend to work best when they're extremely heavy--half the work is done by the weight of the knife, rather than the cook's upper body strength. While the blade here is only 6 inches long, the knife weighs close to 2 pounds, which is hefty enough to tackle the thickest of sternums. The handle is solidly crafted and comfortable, and the weight falls towards the front of the blade, which is just where you want it. Hand wash this knife, and be careful--when wet, it gets very slippery and a bit difficult to handle safely. <I>--Jill Lightner</I>"	COL description VAL "Experience confidence with each cut. The Henckels International CLASSIC 6" Meat Cleaver boasts a precision, fine-edge blade that is honed for long-lasting sharpness. Perfect for prepping large pieces of meat, the broad, rectangular blade also slices through bones so you can break down chicken and portion pork loin effortlessly. With a seamless transition from blade to handle, the knives' fully forged construction provides balance as the traditional triple-rivet handles encourage tireless cutting. Henckels International makes essential kitchen tools every home chef needs. From steak knives to spatulas, every product boasts high quality at an exceptional value. Created in 1895 by Zwilling J.A. Henckels, this value-driven brand guarantees the same durability, design and ease of use for which the global company is known. Equip your kitchen with expertise with Henckels International. Quickly reduce a cooked chicken or duck to bite-size pieces with this instrument. Or use it to butcher any kind of meat or poultry. It's heavy, the way a cleaver should be, so it does the work for you. The blade has a hole in its top corner so it may be hung on a hook or peg. Henckels' International Classic is a moderately priced cutlery line made in countries other than the company's home of Germany. The steel is of lesser quality than that used in its premier lines. Also, the handles are narrower and shallower--a feature those with small hands might appreciate. While this cleaver is dishwasher-safe, hand washing is recommended. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

COL description VAL "Kids test their code-cracking prowess with Mastermind for Kids, the challenging game of logic and deduction. The game comes with three levels of play, so kids can learn and grow with the game. With more than 55 million units sold, Mastermind is a great strategy game . . . and one of the worlds most popular games ever. Its easy to learn and fast to play, and its different every time. The Codemaker sets a secret code, then the Codebreaker tries to match the code using logic, deduction, and maybe even a little bit of luck. After each move, the Codemaker gives clues to the Codebreaker. With lots of possible code combinations, every game is guaranteed to be a brainteaser. All of this mind game's components can be stored in the game board. For 2 players ages 6 and up; the winner will be a true master mind. Includes game console with built-in storage tray and code peg shield, 72 jungle animal pegs in 6 colors, 30 scoring pegs in two colors, and complete instructions. Younger kids can develop their powers of logic and deduction in this game of code-cracking fun. This version is simplified for younger children and comes with colorful animal pegs, a jungle-and-mountain-theme board, and fewer code options. The point is the same: one player duplicates the other's code in as few turns as possible. The code maker sets a code of 3 colored animals (choosing from 72 in six colors), and conceals it beneath a "rocky mountain" tray at his or her side of the board. In each of nine rows (of large holes), the code breaker attempts to replicate the pattern. After each row (or turn), the code maker places red or white creature pieces in the adjacent row of small holes, which gives the code breaker clues on how he or she doing. Complete instructions include rules for younger players (based on colors only), older players (color and position), and expert players (a blank-space option adds complexity). This challenging and fun game is for two players. <i>--Ava Natov</i>"	0

Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly. Feeding for Adult Maintenance: It is important that you feed Pro Plan to your adult cat "free choice" throughout the day, rather than as just a single feeding only at mealtime. Food intake required to maintain ideal body condition will vary, depending on age, activity and environment. Watch your cat's weight and adjust food amounts accordingly. If you have a kitten, or a pregnant or nursing cat, you should continue feeding Pro Plan Focus Kitten Chicken & Rice Formula. Store in a cool, dry place."	1

Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary. This 9-1/4-inch square baker, crafted from commercial-grade  stoneware with Le Creuset's poterie glaze, cooks up a mean hot dish and  looks good doing it. Coated inside and out with the company's signature  enamel, the dish doesn't absorb moisture and resists chips, nicks,  stains, and odors. It's oven-safe to 500 degrees F and can also go in  the freezer, refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. It even looks  good at the table.

Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. "	COL description VAL "Featuring a comfortable and natural stride, the Best Fitness E1 center drive elliptical trainer offers patented technology that ensures the shape of the ellipse is biomechanically correct. This means the machine moves in the same natural motion as your body does, providing a true running feel. Inferior designs can have either too much vertical movement or too much horizontal movement; those units will often make the user feel off-balanced while exercising. The E1, however, will keep you in a balanced upright position for a stable and secure feel. The E1 also has a balanced steel frame which eliminates rocking while maintaining a compact footprint, which makes it ideal for your home workout area (particularly when space is a concern). Combined with its durable components, the steel frame supports users up to 275 pounds while the unit's front transport wheels make it easy to move around. Proper pedal spacing on this elliptical eliminates hip fatigue--when your feet are forced out too wide or in too narrow, your body will incur undue strain on your hips. The E1 also offers a comfortable step-up height to allow you to start your workouts safely while its moving arms recruit your upper body and core to the workout, making this a total body trainer. <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="200"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/best-fit-2-full.jpg" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The E1 offers a compact footprint that's ideal for smaller spaces.</strong></em></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> To track your workout metrics, the E1 offers contact heart rate handles for advanced monitoring.

As the battle for Metru Nui rages on, the line between hero and monster has blurred. According to the complex mythology of Bionicle, six heroes return home to find that hordes of spider-like Visorak have taken over the city they fought so hard to save. Trapped and transformed into half-beasts, the Toa Hordika must stage one final epic battle against the Visorak to save the city--and themselves. Enter the Battle Ram. Pulled by a team of leaping Visorak with glow-in-the-dark pincers, this awesome weapon shatters any obstacle in its path. Equipped with a large catapult and nasty set of spikes, the spider-like ram rains "fiery" boulders down on everything around it. The six mini Toa Hordika must figure out how to stave off the ram using their own unique weapons and talents. Thankfully, this 189-piece set is easier to assemble than piecing together the Bionicle backstory--in fact, Toa and Visorak come preformed, so you can play right away. The colorful diagrams found in the detailed instruction booklet are invaluable in assembling the remaining pieces of this set, which requires the building skills of an older child or adult. The set includes six mini Toa Hordika (Vakama, Nokama, Onewa, Matau, Whenua, Nuju), seven Visorak, the battle ram machine, and various weapons and battle accessories. As with all Lego products, the design is customizable and compatible with other sets, including the extensive Bionicle collection (sold separately), encouraging open-ended constructive and imaginative play. <i>--Heather Lyndon</i>"	0

Players can build from words crossword puzzle-style or by stacking letters on top of tiles already on the board. The challenge is to make new words each time. For example, "stack" becomes "snack," then "snapshot." If it sounds like 3-D Scrabble, there's more to know. Scoring is simpler: each tile earns two points, and each stacked tile earns one. The usual <i>No</i>s apply: no capitalized, hyphenated, or abbreviated words, etc. The set comes with 100 letter tiles, tile racks for two to four players, and a plastic game board. <i>--Lynne Sampson</i>"	COL description VAL "For over 50 years, Scrabble has turned normal families into shouting, squealing, laughing word enthusiasts!

It's still hard to get a triple word score, the tiles are still made of wood, there's only one "X" in the whole box, and family feuds are increasing exponentially. But after 50 years, Scrabble has had a face-lift: a swivel base allows the board to turn so players don't have to work upside down, a plastic grid helps keep tiles in line, and a handy bag stores the letters when they're not in use. The premise hasn't changed at all--two to four players battle it out to make high-scoring words from seven little letters--so choose a dictionary before play begins to avoid ugly confrontations. <i>--Lynne Sampson</i>"	1

COL description VAL "Satin Black Deluxe Tabletop Electric Grill, 1500-watt element and 200-square-inches of cooking surface. Energy efficient, even-cooking, and highly portable, Meco's Deluxe Tabletop Electric Grill features an innovative infrared heating element and 200-square-inches of space for cooking up savory hot meals on the fly. A 1500-watt element emits infrared heat to sear steaks and chicken to tender perfection. Easy-to-control infrared heat cooks evenly without burning. The grill's variable heat control feature enables instant temperature changes from a steak-searing high to a bread-warming low, so there's no waiting or preheating. Unlike charcoal grills that emit an unnatural smoke when juice drips on the coal, the infrared element burns off the dripping fats instantly, smoking food with untainted fumes for a natural, savory taste. Plus, with the Meco electric grill, there's no need for handling flammable lighter fluids or fuel cylinders. The heat reflector is positioned so that it drains excess dripping that might otherwise fuel large, meat-cauterizing flare-ups, though it also retains just enough juice to fuel flames small enough to lightly kiss the meat for a perfect sear. And, there's plenty of cooking space for large cuts of meat, such as, roasts, thick chops, whole chickens, and fancy burgers with all the trimmings. One more cool feature: A dual level mode simultaneously cooks steaks at different temperatures when one diner prefers his steak rare and the other prefers hers well-done. The dual-level mode also keeps bread warm on one side while chicken bakes on the other. Along with all these cooking options, Meco designed this electric grill for simple assembly, easy, economical use, and durability. First of all, the grill is made of high quality steel forms and tubing throughout. And, all components are coated with Meco's quality Dura Fuse powder finish for corrosion resistance and good looks. All critical electrical and mechanical components, including hinges and handles come pre-assembled, so there's no major project to face when the box comes. The tabletop and base attach easily with just a few nuts and bolts. Plus, this energy efficient grill costs half the price of gas grills to operate, and is six times cheaper than cooking with a charcoal grill! Best of all, the whole thing fits into most dishwashers for fast and easy cleaning. <i>--Brian Olson</i>"	1

We earned the reputation as America's family camping brand after more than a century of providing uncompromising quality and high value to our customers. 10 Year Warranty. Customer Care at 1-800-325-4121 and www.wenzelco.com A great choice for three-season hunting trips and car camping excursions, the roomy Wenzel Grande is an affordable rectangular sleeping bag that's temperature rated to 5 degrees Fahrenheit. It's filled with 6.5 pounds of Wenzel's hypoallergenic Insul-Therm polyester fiber fill for excellent warmth retention and loft. The bag has a rugged 10-ounce cotton duck cover and a soft, warm 100 percent cotton flannel inner liner with classic plaid pattern. The quilt-through construction helps reduce the bunching of fill to eliminate cold spots. Other features include self-repairing zippers, a personal storage pocket at the foot, and three integrated compression straps. <b>Specifications:</b> <ul> <li>Shell material: Polyester <li>Liner material: Polyester <li>Size: 81 by 38 inches <li>Fill weight: 6.5 pounds <li>Carry weight: 12.5 pounds <li>Stuff size: 13 by 21 inches <li>Zipper side: Right </ul> <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Sleeping Bag Guide</BIG></font></strong><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Sleep Well: Finding the Right Sleeping Bag</font></strong><br> Sleeping bag technology has come a long way from the days of cowboy bedrolls. These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag: <strong><font color=CC6600>Buy for Cold</font></strong><br> It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10. Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for "warm" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night. <strong><font color=CC6600>Goose or No Goose?</font></strong><br> The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly <i>and</i> stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use. All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget. <strong><font color=CC6600>Bags for All Shapes</font></strong><br> Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips. <strong><font color=CC6600>Pad Yourself</font></strong><br> No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you. "	COL description VAL "Ideal for camping at higher altitudes or in cooler months, the Coleman Dunnock Cold-Weather Sleeping Bag helps you sleep comfortably in temperatures as low as 20F. This sleeping bag features Fiberlock construction that keeps the insulation from shifting, reducing cold spots and increasing durability.

The bottom of the bag unzips to provide extra ventilation on warmer nights. The 2-way patented ZipPlow system plows fabric away from the zipper to prevent snags and frustration. Plus, the Roll Control design and Wrap 'N' Roll integrated packing system make this lightweight backpacking sleeping bag easy to roll and pack.

Scientifically designed with eight grains and nuts, plus a special blend of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, Tropican helps maintain healthy weight levels and enhances plumage. <b>Tropican Lifetime Maintenance Parrot Granules</b> is a scientifically formulated, completely balanced and flavorful maintenance diet for all Conures, Caiques, Quakers, Pionus and Small Amazons. The extruded 4 mm granules are sized to be eaten easily, decreasing waste. Tropican was developed and researched by the Hagen Avicultural Research Institute (HARI) and earns the HARI Seal of Approval. For over two decades, the HARI Flock has been fed exclusively Tropican Formulated diets! Tropican comes in a variety of extruded formulas and sizes to appeal to a variety of birds needs. The Tropican formulated diets includes: Ample fresh food and water should always be available to satisfy the demands of your pet bird. The food and water cups should be cleaned and re-filled daily with fresh water and fresh seeds to keep your pet bird healthy. Breeding parrots need extra protein to trigger reproductive hormones and ensure a healthy egg production. The female also requires more nutrients in her diet when rearing young because she is eating for more than just herself! While fledgling or juvenile parrot species do reach the outward appearance of an adult by the time they are weaned, their bodies on the inside are still developing and do benefit from a little extra &lsquo;punch&rsquo; of nutrients during this stage of their life. Achieve greater weaning success during this stressful time by spoon feeding warm, softened Tropican High Performance Weaning Diet when making the transition from syringe feeding to solid foods. If the babies are fed Tropican Hand Feeding Formula, they&rsquo;ll quickly recognize the same flavor and adapt to eating the softened Tropican on their own. It is suggested to feed Tropican High Performance Tropican Weaning Diet for the first six months after weaning for most parrot species, and up to nine months for large macaw species. Parrots that have been eating a primary diet of traditional parrot seed mix need a little boost to their amino acid profile, as well as other essential nutrients. They&rsquo;ve been getting all the fat they need, perhaps too much. But, they are not getting a complete amino acid profile; therefore, they haven&rsquo;t been getting the right protein. Tropican High Performance is made with ground sunflower meat and peanut kernel, a flavor those seed junkies will be sure to recognize and relish!"

The filament inside an incandescent lamp must be protected so that oxygen does not reach it and cause it to evaporate on contact. Most incandescent lamps are either vacuum-sealed or gas-filled. Incandescent lamp filaments are made of tungsten. Tungsten is a metal that can operate at very high temperatures without evaporating too quickly an resulting in early lamp failure. Incandescent filaments only convert about 10 percent of the energy used into visible light, so it is necessary to use a material that can withstand extremely high temperatures. Most lamps use a coiled filament design, which has been found to be stronger and deliver better performance."	1

COL description VAL "pH is the measure of acidity of water, on a scale ranging from 0 to 14. A pH of 0 is the most acidic, while a pH of 14 is the most alkaline. Different geographies have different tap water conditions with different pH levels, while fish require a specific pH level to thrive. A pH of 7.0 is ideal when keeping a community aquarium containing a variety of tropical fish. Goldfish and livebearers prefer a pH of 7.5. Many Amazonian fish, like angelfish and neon tetras, prefer a pH of 6.5 to 6.8. Mollies and swordtails thrive at pH 7.2 to 7.5. API pH UP Freshwater Aquarium Water pH Raising Solution raises aquarium pH in freshwater aquariums to desired level. Safe for fish and plants.

Quality means they always easily and effectively sharpen your equipment.26Cmkulante and Unbrokratische service performance on defects in materials and workmanship beyond the statutory warranty period. Following a few simple steps to sharpen your valuable knives with this honing steel from W&uuml;sthof's premier line, Grand Prix, will keep the blades as sharp as new for a lifetime. Sharper knives are safer because they don't slip and require less effort to use. To sharpen, hold the steel in your left hand (reverse if you are left-handed) and simply slide the knife blade down the steel at a 20-degree angle. It takes only a few strokes, and you won't believe the difference. This steel sharpens all blades from small to large, including shears. Peer into the private kitchens of professional chefs, and chances are you'll see W&uuml;sthof cutlery. <i>--Amy Adams</i>"	COL description VAL "When that time comes that you need to touch up the sharp edge of your Wusthof knife the 10" steel is a good option. This is the deluxe Wusthof 10" inch steel it has a slightly larger shaft and more substantial handle.it can realign your knife edge quickly and easily. Honing steels are often confused as sharpeners. Your honing steel will realaign your knife edge but will not put a new edge on it. In trying to explain what a honing steel does try to imaging your sharpening steel and your toothbrush. It is a maintaince tool that you use everyday. In the case of your knife this would be maintaining the knifes edge. Now eventually you would need to see your dentist. That would be a sharpener. This would be a more detailed and agressive action and they would actually remove metal from the edge of the knife. Much like a dentist would do to your teeth. Now to maintain healthy teeth you brush everyday. To maintain a sharp knife you should steel your knife everyday. And remember only go to the Dentist(sharpener) once or twice a year. This tool serves a vital role in the kitchen by realigning, or resetting, a knifes' edges, which bend this way and that when contacting a cutting surface. (Often called a sharpening steel, or butcher steel, a steel doesn't actually sharpen a knife--unless it's a diamond steel.) Consisting of a rod of hard steel-alloy and a tough synthetic handle, this steel works as well as any. A loop facilitates hanging it close at hand so the steel can be employed often: before each use is ideal to prevent a blade from becoming dull and prolong intervals between professional sharpenings. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it; this steel's 10-inch rod is sufficient for nearly all household knives. The steel carries a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

This Chef's Choice knife sharpener performs professional-quality sharpening on any knife, from gourmet knives to hunting knives--even the tips of serrated knives can be improved with this machine (for a complete sharpening of serrated knives, however, Chef's Choice recommends models 120 and 320). For top-quality edges, there are two sharpening and honing stages, which use 100% diamond abrasives, and a final polishing stage. Each stage uses precision angle guides to create a unique "Trizor-Plus" edge for maximum sharpness and durability, while a magnetic pad collects residue so the machine is easy to clean and maintain.

COL description VAL "When that time comes that you need to touch up the sharp edge of your Wusthof knife the 10" steel is a good option. This is the deluxe Wusthof 10" inch steel it has a slightly larger shaft and more substantial handle.it can realign your knife edge quickly and easily. Honing steels are often confused as sharpeners. Your honing steel will realaign your knife edge but will not put a new edge on it. In trying to explain what a honing steel does try to imaging your sharpening steel and your toothbrush. It is a maintaince tool that you use everyday. In the case of your knife this would be maintaining the knifes edge. Now eventually you would need to see your dentist. That would be a sharpener. This would be a more detailed and agressive action and they would actually remove metal from the edge of the knife. Much like a dentist would do to your teeth. Now to maintain healthy teeth you brush everyday. To maintain a sharp knife you should steel your knife everyday. And remember only go to the Dentist(sharpener) once or twice a year. This tool serves a vital role in the kitchen by realigning, or resetting, a knifes' edges, which bend this way and that when contacting a cutting surface. (Often called a sharpening steel, or butcher steel, a steel doesn't actually sharpen a knife--unless it's a diamond steel.) Consisting of a rod of hard steel-alloy and a tough synthetic handle, this steel works as well as any. A loop facilitates hanging it close at hand so the steel can be employed often: before each use is ideal to prevent a blade from becoming dull and prolong intervals between professional sharpenings. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it; this steel's 10-inch rod is sufficient for nearly all household knives. The steel carries a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "4472-7 Features: -Used for honing. -Triple riveted handle. -Finger guard. -Hand wash recommended. -Classic collection. -Construction: Forged.

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand when using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie for one in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when dissembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete</I>"	1

There is no bolster, but there is a full-tang. As with the more expensive W&#xFC;sthof Classic knives, Gourmet handles are made of a triple-riveted, black composite shaped to fit the hand comfortably. The shorter of two boning knives, this one features a narrow, five-inch blade formed in the traditional S-curve with a very sharp tip. The blade on this particular model is on the stiff side, which makes it better for boning beef; W&#xFC;sthof's more flexible model excels at poultry. An excellent gift for any home chef, the knife is covered by a lifetime warranty and is dishwasher-safe, though W&#xFC;sthof recommends washing and drying its cutlery by hand. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>"	COL description VAL " The Derby chair features a simple and comfortable design.

Quantity: 100 Also available in quantities of 25, 50 and 200. -----How to make a Scrabble tile pendant using square epoxy stickers-----Carefully peel the clear square epoxy sticker off of its protective backing, being careful not to touch the sticky side. Place the sticker directly on top of the image you are using. Press firmly with your fingers to remove any air-bubbles and to help secure the adhesive bond. Cut out the image with the sticker on top - carefully cutting along the edge of the sticker, making sure not to cut the sticker itself. Spread glue (a white glue such as Nunn permanent glue or Crafter's Pick works fine) on the backside of the cut out image/sticker. Center the image/sticker glue side down onto the non-letter side of the Scrabble tile (check the orientation of the letter on the back to make sure it's facing the right direction). Press into place and let dry. You can easily add a glue on bail such as an Aanraku bail to the back of the pendant once the front side is dry. It is recommended to use E6000 industrial strength adhesive to adhere the bail."	COL description VAL "Wrights easy square junior is great for blocking squares up to 6-inch.

The filter is pleated, so it has a remarkable filtering capacity for its compact size. The filter canister mounts directly to the collector housing. Four finger-operated knobs lock the canister in place, so installation and removal is easy and tool free. For further convenience, a top-mounted handle operates a pair of "hands" that wipe across the filter pleats and knock off dust buildup. Turning the handle one full revolution per month is all that is required to keep the dust collector operating effectively. What's more, collector (catch) bag capacity for both fabric and plastic bags is an impressive 10 cubic feet, meaning you won't have to worry about frequent bag changes. <b>Powerful and Efficient Dust Collection</b><br>The PM1300 is powered by a 1-3/4-HP, 1-Ph, 115/220V TEFC (totally enclosed fan-cooled) motor for effective air movement. The motor is secured to a mount on the dust collector's base platform, creating a low center of gravity and ensuring easy movement around the shop. Just as efficient as it is powerful, the PM1300 features all-metal duct construction that provides rigidity and maximum air flow. Additionally, dual four-inch dust ports allow for simultaneous collection from two machines. <b>Convenient Remote-Control Operation</b><br>For convenience, the PM1300 comes with a full-function infrared remote control. The remote emits an invisible light-based signal in a 120-degree cone--so you can use it pretty much whenever the dust collector is within your line of sight. To help save on energy costs, a digital timer can be programmed on the remote for up to 99 minutes of continuous operation at the level you choose. The remote can also be used to turn the dust collector on and off. <table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="75" align="left"><tr><td><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/content_26/Q1_2010/jet_B001AZNJT8_3-sm.jpg" border="0" align="left"></td></tr></table><b>Dimensions and Warranty Information</b><br>The PM1300 measures 29.0 x 72.0 x 37.0 inches (WxHxD) and weighs 150 pounds. Because the canister has an overall height of approximately six feet, it's an ideal choice for shops with low ceilings or overhead clearances, especially in comparison to the taller PM1300 Dust Collector with Filter Bag.

Elliptical trainer workouts burn a similar number of calories as jogging but without the risk of injury to the back, knees, hips, or ankles. Since your feet never leave the pedals the Stamina Air 1725 Cross Trainer gives a low-impact workout that is easy on your joints. In fact, whereas jogging, jumping rope, aerobics classes, and exercising on a treadmill all require your body to absorb the force of impact, exercising on an elliptical can be compared to running in midair. Because ellipticals are so low impact and easy on the joints, they are also a good choice for older people or for individuals who have old injuries. Up and down buttons adjust the resistance to control the intensity of your workout. The monitor's built-in fingertip pulse sensor tracks your heart rate so you work out within your target heart rate zone. Elliptical trainers mimic the natural path of the foot, the extension of the leg, and the rotation of the hip during walking or running. This motion uses all the leg muscles, giving you a total lower body workout while the dual action arms work your upper body and let you increase or decrease intensity. Work your arms harder to tone and to burn more calories. The foot pedals can be worked in a forward or reverse direction. Resistance may be added as desired to increase the workload on your legs throughout the forward or backward stride to tone thighs and glutes.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise.

Keeps toxic and harmful chemicals off your pets, out of your house, and away from your family. 2. Its economical  one bottles of Terra Pet Naturals Tick and Flea Repellent can last several months! 3. Its better for the environment  at Terra Pet Naturals we use only natural, plant-based ingredients. We also use minimal packaging and recyclable materials. Frequently Asked Questions: Q: How Long Will This product last for? A: It depends on the dogs size, the area where you live, and how frequently your dog might be exposed to ticks and fleas. Each 8 oz. bottle of spray contains approximately 900 single sprays, meaning that it if you used 30 single sprays on your dog two times a week, a single bottle of spray would last approximately four months. Q: My dog has sensitive skin, are these products safe? A: The ingredients used in our products are both gentle and safe. In fact, apple cider vinegar is known to help improve skin conditions! As with all naturals products, it is possible (although unlikely) that your dog might be allergic to an ingredient in our spray. If irritation or swelling occurs, discontinue use and contact a veterinarian. Q: Ive been using your product, but I just found a tick on my dog. Does that mean the product isnt working? A: Although our tick and flea repellents are highly effective and repel the vast majority of ticks, it is possible that once-in-awhile, a tick might still try to attach itself to your dog. If you find this is the case, try applying more spray on your dog, focusing on areas where ticks like to attach (i.e. head, ears). Q: Ive seen other natural tick and flea products on the market. How is yours different? A: Terra Pet Naturals uses a custom blend of 11 different essential oils along with apple cider vinegar, providing maximum protection against ticks and fleas. We use all-natural ingredients and strive to be eco-friendly in all our practices."	0

Quickly measure and modify the six aquarium levels that are most important to the health of your freshwater fish with the API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT. To stay healthy and thrive, fish need properly balanced levels of ammonia, pH, high range pH, nitrite and nitrate. These levels can change rapidly and create harmful conditions when fish waste, uneaten food or other organic matter accumulate, or when untreated water is added. If left uncorrected, all of these can be harmful or even fatal to fish, with consequences such as reduction of oxygen, increase in stress and higher risk of disease. The API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT measures these six parameters with scientific accuracy and provides professional results. It comes with four glass test tubes, a holding tray, test tube rack and computer calibrated, laminated color card. Just fill the test tubes, add the test drops and compare results to the color card.

Now you can experience that same sensation without even riding the motorcycle. Play the all-new Harley-Davidson edition of the Monopoly Game. America's favorite board game is a motorcycle-lover's dream come true! Buy renowned Harley bikes, purchase rare Harley collector items and pick up exotic custom gas tanks.

And so it is with the game of Monopoly: Harley-Davidson Live To Ride Edition, the classic real estate trading game in a customized version that successfully melds Parker Brothers with Pascal Picotte. Game play is the same as the traditional version--buying, selling, and collecting rents on properties and enhancing their value by erecting various structures--but this game board features Harley collectibles and the structures are garages and dealerships (the Live To Ride version of houses and hotels).

The game pieces have been modeled after the main characters from the film: Manny and Ellie (both mammoths), Diego the saber-toothed tiger, and Sid the sloth. The figures are detailed, colorful, and convincing -- certain to charm fans of the movie.<P> Players begin by arranging 24 tiles in a six by four grid at the center of the board. Since the tiles are shuffled and placed randomly, you'll never play through the same board twice -- each game experience is unique. Once the board is set up, it's a race to find all four of your acorns. Players take turns flipping over tiles of their choice, in search of their acorns. Be careful, though: if you flip over the wrong tile, you might awaken Rudy, a frightful dinosaur who will send you back to your starting position.<P> The rules of the game are straightforward, and kids should have no trouble learning how to play. If they're struggling with the written instructions, they can watch the easy-to-follow video tutorial on the DVD. <P> <b>Interactive DVD Keeps Game Exciting </b><br> The entire game is played alongside the interactive DVD. With each turn you take, the DVD presents you with one of eight mini-games. Ranging from puzzles to memory tests, these mini-games are fast-paced and give the game a digital aspect. Since it requires DVD operation, this game is best played with adult supervision. This isn't too much of a concern, however: the mini-games are engaging enough to keep even adults entertained.<P> The DVD's production values are impressive, and the menus and music channel the spirit of the Ice Age films to the players. It is loaded with clips from all three Ice Age movies, which play periodically through the game. Parents should be mindful that the some of the scenes (particularly those featuring the antagonist, Rudy) might be a bit too intense for younger viewers. For this reason, it's recommended for ages 6 and up.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, game board, 24 double-sided board tiles, 5 game movers, instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318929-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL description VAL "It's the same family with an all-new feud.

Now you won't have to wait for your central heating system to do what this Broan fan/heater can do instantly. <div class="aplus" ><div class="two-third-col"> You don't need to heat the entire house to have a comfortable bathroom first thing in the morning. The NuTone QT9093WH combination fan/heater/light/nightlight combines a high-output 1500-watt heater with a 110 CFM ventilation fan and 100-watt lighting, warming your bathroom at the touch of a switch. Now you won't have to wait for your central heating system to do what this Broan fan/heater can do instantly. Offering quiet operation, the QT9093WH produces 3.0 sones of noise to ensure your bathroom remains peaceful. Crafted with galvanized steel and a die-cast zinc grille in white enamel, it's a suitable match for any decor no matter how many times you change the paint color. The bright incandescent lighting uses one 100-watt A19 lamp (not included), and its nightlight function (7-watt bulb, not included) has the perfect glow to light a dark bathroom during a nighttime visit. This easy-to-install combination fan and light projects just three inches from the ceiling, and it includes detachable junction box with three wiring knockouts and a four-function wall switch. Other features include expansion-type hanger bars and mounting brackets, plus a built-in quiet, nonmetallic backdraft damper. You hastily get ready every morning, head for work, the office, or school, just when the central heating system has finished warming the entire house. It's about as inefficient as it gets. Spot heating solves that problem. No longer will you heat an entire home when you simply need a bit of comfort in the bath or dressing room, or any other room. Even the most efficient central heating systems send heat up the chimney. But NuTone spot heaters deliver every bit of energy back into your home. There's no external venting, so the electricity you convert to heat is delivered directly where you want it. Permanently lubricated motors are quiet and require no maintenance. They can be operated by a built-in adjustable thermostat or an optional wall-mount controller. Heaters may be converted in the field to a choice of wattages/voltages. And for safety, heaters are thermal overload protected and the complete heater assembly conveniently removes from the housing for cleaning. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. NuTone ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. Today, Broan-NuTone leads the industry with forward-thinking residential ventilation products, customized climate, communications and storage solutions and superior customer service. The Broan brand focuses on range hoods, ventilation fans, heater/fan/light combination units, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) fresh air systems, built-in heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators and trash compactors, while the NuTone brand offers door chimes, central vacuum systems, stereo intercom systems, medicine cabinets, ironing centers, ceiling fans and ventilation fans."

Girth Measurements: Girth M 27"-35" Girth L 30"-37" Girth XL 32"-39" How To Measure Your Dog Find your dog's girth, which is the widest point of your dog's chest and rib cage area. Harness size measurements are based on girth, which can vary according to breed. Some dogs, like Boxers, are more deep-chested than others. It is important to accurately measure your dog's girth for the best size possible. 1) Stand over your dog and place one end of the tape measure on his spine, just above the widest part of his rib cage. 2) With your other hand, wrap the tape measure behind his front legs and around his body, going underneath the widest part of his rib cage. Place this end next to the beginning of the tape. Put your thumb on the number that meets up with the beginning of the tape measure. The higher number is the girth measurement. 3) Order the proper harness size based on your dog's girth measurement. If your dog's measurement falls between two different sizes, order the larger size if want to allow room to grow."	0

Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary."

COL description VAL "<div class="aplus"> <h5> Advantage of Freshly Ground Spices </h5> There are many benefits to freshly grinding pepper, salt, herbs and spices for cooking and seasoning. A quality mill with a specifically designed grinding mechanism will release the aromas and essential oils of that spice. Freshly ground pepper and spices have more aroma and better flavor than pre- ground. Another advantage of using freshly ground spices or minerals (salts) is the control a mill provides for determining the coarseness (size) of a grind. A high quality pepper, salt or spice mill gives you the ability to choose and change the coarseness according to taste or necessity. When looking for a pepper, salt or spice grinder, consider the following: <b>Grinding mechanism: </b>Choose a grinding mechanism that can withstand daily use: one that is well made and produces a consistent grind. Ideally, the grinding mechanism should be designed to handle a specific spice, as each spice has different physical characteristics that will benefit from different design features. <b>Design and appearance: </b>Whether it's traditional or modern, manual or electric, a mill can be an indispensable tool in your kitchen and a beautiful part of table decor. <b>Ease of Use: </b>A quality mill should be easy to adjust, easy to fill, and feel comfortable in the hand. Peugeot's story starts in the 19th century when the Peugeot brothers converted the family's gristmill into a steel foundry. They began producing award winning hand tools immediately after opening and went on to produce a diverse range of exceptional quality products including small appliances, bicycles and most notably, automobiles. (Although now operating as a separate company, the Peugeot car company continues the same commitment to quality and innovation that is a Peugeot hallmark). In 1840 Peugeot created their burr style coffee grinder and adopted that design to accommodate peppercorns in 1874. The resulting pepper mechanism design is still used today in every Peugeot pepper mill. Peugeot's iconic pepper grinding mechanism design is often copied, but never equaled. Today, Peugeot offers six unique spice-specific mechanisms plus the original burr-style coffee grinder. There are no shortcuts: each mechanism is designed to get the most out of the spices they are intended for. After more than 160 years, Peugeot mills and grinders remain the benchmark of the industry and have earned their position as the mill of choice in world class kitchens. The primary difference between Peugeot and all other brands are the spice-specific mechanisms. Peugeot has 7 unique spice specific mechanisms for pepper, salt, herbs and spices, coffee, wet salt, chili peppers and nutmeg. For each spice, there is one - and only one - Peugeot grinding mechanism, each made of the ideal design and constructed from the best material available for its intended use. All Peugeot mechanisms are made in France and carry a lifetime limited warranty. Peugeot's <b>Pepper Grinding Mechanism</b> is a two stage burr-style system. During production, the helix-shaped grooves and grinding teeth of the pepper mechanism are individually cut before the steel is case hardened to make it virtually indestructible. The mechanism is then given a proprietary treatment to provide additional protection against corrosion. During use, the helix- shaped grooves guide whole peppercorns through the mechanism to crack, then grind to a consistent size by a double row of teeth. This process releases the pepper's essential oils, resulting in more flavor and aroma for your dish. This patented mechanism is found on every Peugeot Pepper mill and is widely considered the best pepper mechanism available Peugeot's <b>Salt Crushing Mechanism</b> features two ribbed plates which work to fracture and crush coarse, dry sea salt to a consistent size. The salt grinding mechanism is made of corrosion resistant Stainless Steel, and is found on every Peugeot Salt Mill. Peugeot's <b>Spice Mechanism</b> is made of ceramic, and is specially designed to grind dried spices and flat leafy herbs to release their essential oils. It is particularly effective with dried aromatic herbs such as thyme, parsley, basil, oregano, and herbs de Provence, as well as dried seeds such as cumin. Peugeot's <b>Chili Pepper Mechanism</b> is made of case hardened steel for optimal hardness and resilience. This patented mechanism features a pre-cutting system and dual chamber reservoir. For use with dry, hot chilis such as birds tongue, African devils and Piri Piri. The <b>Nutmeg Shaving Mechanism</b> is made of treated stainless steel which is corrosion resistant, and offers superior edge retention. The Peugeot nutmeg shaver is equipped with a double stainless steel grater blade and a strong claw which enables the whole nutmeg to be very finely shaved, while keeping fingers safe. Intended for use with whole nutmeg nuts. Peugeot's <b>Wet Salt mechanism</b> has been specially designed for wet sea salt: a spiral guides the salt, ensuring that it does not stick together. The mechanism is made of ceramic because wet salt crystals are soft (wear is not an issue) but corrosive. Intended for use with damp sea salts such as Sel de Guerande. The <b>Coffee Grinding Mechanism</b> found in all Peugeot coffee mills is the foundation of Peugeot's grinding legacy. The case-hardened steel mechanism efficiently cracks and grinds coffee beans to the desired consistency:from espresso fine to coffee- press coarse. For best results, hold mill and turn mill top in a clockwise direction only To adjust the Grind on manual mills not equipped with u'Select, turn the adjustment nut located on the top of the mill. - clockwise to obtain a finer grind - counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind Electric mills permit single-handed use, leaving you free to cook at the same time. Just press the button to start grinding. To adjust the grind on an electric mill, turn the thumbwheel grind adjustment (found below the grinding mechanism on electric mills that are not equipped with the u'Select system). - Clockwise to obtain a finer grind, - Counter-clockwise to obtain a coarser grind. Classic Electric Salt Mills (not fitted with the u'Select grind adjustment system) are pre-set to medium and cannot be adjusted.

The object is to be the first "candidate" to land on the Presidential Seal. The game, designed for children and adults to play together, is divided into two parts: the Convention and the Campaign. During the Convention, you, the delegate, must accumulate enough correct answers about presidents and the presidency to advance to the Campaign portion, where you'll have to answer questions about U.S. history and geography. The beauty of this game is that the questions are grouped into four difficulty ratings--easy child, hard child, easy adult, hard adult--so players of all knowledge levels can play together. Some of the easy questions are really easy ("Name the national anthem of the U.S."), while others seem a bit obscure ("Did Dakota Territory troops fight in the Civil War?").

COL description VAL "Kershaws popular lineup of the Leek is back with a sleek bead-blasted blade and olive drab handle for an eye-catching, yet discreet EDC. Like all Leeks, the olive version features a 3-inch Sandvik stainless steel blade with a razor-sharp edge, highlighting excellent edge retention, corrosion resistance and toughness. The modified drop-point blade, bead-blasted for stylish good looks to help hide scratches, makes it an ideal-shaped knife for slicing, while the slim tip makes piercing and detail work easy. The handle, made of 6061-T6 anodized aluminum and bonded with an olive drab dye, is resistant wear, corrosion and fading. SpeedSafe assisted opening offers smooth one-handed blade operation using the flipper or thumbstud. The Leeks secure locking liner prevents accidental blade closure during use and a sliding tip-lock keeps the blade safely in the handle during transport. The pocketclip is reversible for tip-up or tip-down carry and the handle is pre-drilled for lanyard attachment. There are lots of very good reasons the Leek is one of the most popular Kershaw's. For one thing, the slim blade is remarkably versatile. This modified drop-point blade shape gives it good slicing capabilities, while the slim tip lets it excel at piercing and detail work. The blade steel is high-performance Sandvik 14C28N stainless that sharpens to a razor edge and holds the edge for a good long time. The 3-inch blade is perfect for most day-to-day tasks. Leek lovers also love the fast and easy opening provided by Speed Safe assisted opening. Whether you're left-handed or right-handed, a simple pull back on the ambidextrous flipper or push outward on the thumb stud and the Leeks blade is ready to go to work. But the newest and most obvious thing about this Leek is the olive drab handle color. The color is eye-catching and different, but also discrete. The olive drab color is fade-resistant, scratch-resistant and permanently bonded to the anodized aluminumso it looks good now and looks good later, too.

There are eight Lego mini-figures, classic cars, corner light fixtures, and a fountain to place in the town square. Collectors are sure to notice the inclusion of unique Lego elements and bricks in rare colors. <b>Bringing the Town to Life</b><br> With 35 bags containing 1,981 pieces and two large instruction booklets, the Town Plan set took our eight-year-old Lego tester about 12 hours to build. Like with all Lego sets, the instructions include here provide colorful step-by-step images that make it fairly easy for any diligent builder to create the detailed town buildings and vehicles. We did have about 20 left-over pieces at the end of construction, which puzzled our tester. While it may seem like this mature set is designed to appeal to adults, our young tester immediately found lots of different ways to have fun with it. The cinema got a big thumbs up for having cool, realistic details like popcorn at the concession stand and a movie on the screen. The moving garage door and the scrubbers in the car wash were big hits, too. <P> The rooms inside Town Hall are a little small, which limits Lego figures who want to move around. This pushed lots of play out into the open area around the fountain. The three gold bricks in the fountain add a unique touch to this particular set. The one minor complaint that surfaced in our testing was that the flowers and vegetation "planted" around the Town Hall failed to stay securely attached when moving pieces around. Overall, this is an expansive town set that promises lots of creative construction projects. With so many people and buildings, and more than one vehicle, this Town is a great pick for a single creative builder or cooperative play with friends and siblings. Additionally, with its unique 1950's vibe, this town is set to inspire fun, interactive play between parents or grandparents and kids. Odds are, you'll even find yourself driving the vintage car through the wash after your children have gone to bed--it's that cool. <b>What's in the Box</b><br> 1,981 Lego pieces and two instruction booklets. <br clear="all">"	0

COL description VAL "The PetSafe Wireless Fence Pet Containment System is a revolutionary concept that provides the safest, simplest form of pet containment. Plug in the transmitter somewhere inconspicuous in your home. The transmitter emits a unique radio signal around your home. Your pet wears a lightweight receiver collar that "listens" for the signal. While the collar is receiving the signal your dog is free to run and play in your yard. When he approaches the boundary of the signal area he will hear a warning tone. If your dog does not return he receives a static correction which is startling but not harmful. With simple training your dog will quickly learn his boundaries - typically within approximately 2 weeks. The training of your pet is a key element with the PetSafe Wireless Fence. Follow the easy instruction and training manual that is included. For use in the U.S. only. This unit is compatible with all US 120V outlets and are not to be used with 220V international voltage. REMINDER: The Wireless Transmitter will be located in the center of the circular containment area. The containment area CANNOT be changed into a square or rectangle shape. A variety of factors, including terrain, topography and metal objects such as automobiles may affect operating range. Contact PetSafe Customer Care if you have any questions before or after your purchase. Spend less time fussing over installation and more time playing with your pup! Short training sessions will have your pets aware of their limits quickly. Plus, our waterproof collars offer 5 levels of static correction (and a tone-only mode) for customized reinforcement based on your dogs temperament. And for trips, the unit is easily portable  just plug it into an outlet! Cover a maximum of 180 feet in diameter or 90 feet in radius, with a minimum of 10 feet in diameter or 5 feet in radius. Plus, you can combine it with additional transmitters to expand your pets play area. Automatic safety shut-off."	COL description VAL "This containment system keeps your pet safely contained and secure in your yard. Install the system in about a weekend by setting up the transmitter and burying wires around your yard. The fence covers up to 5 acres with additional wire and flags. You'll place flags around your yard and train your pet where his new yard boundaries are in fun, quick training sessions over the next 2 weeks. Most pets learn their new boundaries quickly. If your pet gets too close to the yard edge, the waterproof receiver collar reminds your pet with a warning beep, followed by a safe, gentle static correction if he continues. Add an unlimited number of pets by purchasing an extra collar for each pet."	1

Five of the players in NHL 13 are making their Sports Picks debuts, while the lone "Sports Picks veteran" is showing off his new team's jersey and celebrating the rejuvenation of his already-impressive career. It's easy to get excited about NHL 13's numbers: five new players, two standout rookies, and one missing tooth. The rookie hype leading into the season was all about Pittsburgh's Sidney Crosby, but Alexander Ovechkin stole half the spotlight by season's end. With 52 goals and 54 assists, Ovechkin became only the second rookie in NHL history (alongside Teemu Selanne) to score 50 goals and tally 100 points in his rookie season. The Russian superstar's 106 points are the second best in team history, begging the question -- "What's he going to do for an encore?""	0

The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor handles a variety of food preparation tasks including chopping, grinding, pur&eacute;eing, emulsifying and blending. The patented auto-reversing SmartPower blade provides a super-sharp edge for the delicate chopping of herbs and for blending and pur&eacute;eing other soft foods. The blunt edge offers a powerful cutting surface to grind through spices and other hard foods. Pulse activation gives maximum control for precision processing, whether chopping or grinding. Spatula, product manual and recipe booklet included. Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor The powerful high-speed 250-Watt motor works hard and fast to accomplish any small job with ease. Chop herbs, onions, garlic; grind spices, hard cheese, pur&eacute;e baby foods; blend mayonnaise and flavored butters, all with the same compact appliance. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor takes up minimum counter space and stores neatly on the countertop or in a cabinet. Best Practices When Using Your Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Processor Size Always cut large pieces of food into smaller pieces of even size &ndash; about 1/2-Inch. If you don't start with pieces that are small and uniform, you will not get an even chop. Quantity You don&rsquo;t want to overload the 3-Cup work bowl. Use the quantities given in the included recipe section of the product manual. As a rule of thumb, remember that after being processed, food should not reach more than 2/3 of the way up the central hub of the blade assembly. Selecting the Right Operating Control Use the Chop function for chopping, pur&eacute;eing and mixing. It&rsquo;s the best option, for example, when chopping soft, fragile food such as herbs, celery, onions, garlic and most cheeses. It is also the right choice for pur&eacute;eing cooked vegetables, making mayonnaise and mixing salad dressing. Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Use the Grind function for grinding spices and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts. Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. Adding Liquid You can add liquids such as water, oil or flavoring while the machine is running. For example, you might want to add oil when making mayonnaise or salad dressing, or you could add vanilla or alcohol when making frozen yogurt. Pour the liquid through one of the two openings in the cover. Removing Food From the Sides of the Bowl Occasionally food will stick to the sides of the bowl as you process. Stop the machine to clear food away. After the blade has stopped moving, remove the cover and use the spatula to scrape the food from the sides of the bowl back into the center. Cleaning and Storage Read to clean up? No problem To simplify cleaning, rinse the work bowl, cover and blade immediately after each use, so that food won&rsquo;t dry on them. Wash blade assembly, work bowl, cover and spatula in warm soapy water. If you have a dishwasher, you can wash the work bowl, cover, blade assembly and spatula on the top rack. The Mini-Prep Plus Processor stores neatly on the countertop in a minimum of space. The hidden cord storage underneath the motor base will help to keep excess cord off the countertop. Store the unit assembled to prevent loss of parts.

COL description VAL "Good knives make any cutting task more enjoyable. These three, must have, knives are a perfect starter collection in any kitchen. The sandwich, 8inch cooks knife and a paring knife are the most versitile kitchen knives and are used for a variety of tasks. The Wusthof Culinar brush stainless handle design is combined with a contoured shape to add comfort and control. Located in The Cutlery Capital of the World, Solingen Germany, the Wusthof factory history goes back as far as 1814 when the company was listed with the Duchy of Berg. To this day, the company remains family owned. Throughout it&#8217;s history, Wusthof has focused almost solely on the manufacturing of forged knives for the professional chef and home cooking enthusiast. Wusthof uses a special blend of German steel through out the whole length of the knife. The ingredients of this steel are proudly etched on each blade. Wusthof not only uses the best materials to make a fine knife, but it is also crucial that each blade is precisely tempered. This tempering allows the knife to hold its edge for an extremely long time, yet still be able to be maintained in your home kitchen with out the need to be sent away for maintenance. Our unique compound angle is not seen in many knives. This angle tapers from the spine of the knife to the edge to allow for a sturdy, yet extremely sharp edge while it also tapers from the bolster to the tip to give the knife strength as well as flexibility. Elegant satin-finish handles sculpted from 18/10 stainless steel distinguish Culinar cutlery from W&uuml;sthof's other cutlery lines. Otherwise Culinar knives embody all the virtues of other W&uuml;sthof knives that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. The three knives in this set exemplify that control while providing a cook with the essentials: an 8-inch cook's knife (chef's knife) for rocking through chopping and mincing tasks, a 6-inch sandwich knife for myriad slicing and cutting needs, and a 3-1/2-inch paring knife for fruits and vegetables. Like all fine cutlery, these knives should be hand washed. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "Chef Specialties 7 Inch Lehigh Pepper Mill and Salt Shaker Set ."	0

COL description VAL "What is Black Label? It's a whole new line being marketed independently of Dragon or Cyber-Hobby kits. The result will be reduced prices for big items in this new line. The first Black Label item is the 65-ton M103 Heavy Tank that served with the US Army and US Marine Corps (USMC) during the height of the Cold War from 1957-1974. Its whole design was predicated on the need to counter Soviet heavy tanks and thus it boasted a rifled 120mm M58 cannon for long-distance engagements. This gun fired a separate-loading round, which required two loaders, thus giving five men in the crew. The armor was up to 180mm thick on the front of the turret. Some 300 T43E1 tanks were built, of which 219 were later converted to M103A1 standard and 153 rebuilt into M103A2 s. Dragon's kit is a brand new item and practically every part in the cram-packed box is a new tooling. The only exception is the wheels, which are derived from a previous release. The irregular form of the turret is accurately shaped and it has just the right degree of a subtle cast texture. The cast texture on the hull is also beautifully recreated. This tank has been produced with modeling convenience in mind too, with such features as easy-fitting DS tracks. With Dragon's know how and technological skills from its WWII range being applied to this more modern subject, this M103A1 Heavy Tank sets high standards. It's truly a heavyweight in modern armor kits! Dragon's 1/35 scale WWII plastic kits are legendary worldwide in terms of the range's scope, accuracy and technical quality. Utilizing that expertise and experience, a brand new line called Black Label is going to offer some exciting subjects to eager modelers. What is Black Label?

COL description VAL "UPC Code: 230173, dimension:18.75x4.5x1.75 inches Although steels often are touted as sharpening tools, few actually sharpen knife blades but do perform the vital task of realigning, or "resetting," edges, which bend when contacting a cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool's surface contains diamond dust, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. While using this steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings. This steel will also perform better than a steel without diamond dust because it accomplishes the final task of a professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine point while realigning the edge. The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it, and this steel's 12-inch rod handles all household knives. The steel carries a lifetime warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "For most home chefs the sharpening steel will realign the edge and remove any niche or burr.

Simply start the engine with one quick pull, and you're ready to mow. Because it's powered by rear wheel drive, the Lawn-Boy 10641 maneuvers well on irregular surfaces.

On the outside shell, a kaleidoscopic menagerie of wild animals are on parade. Roaming through vivid foliage are a pink monkey with yellow ears and nose, a giant yellow and orange frog with green eyes and green and pink spots, a pink and red striped snake, an elephant, and a tiger. The drumhead looks like (but probably isn't) real skin, and is reinforced below with a transparent plastic membrane. And the sound? Not at all bad. Variations of hand and finger action produce lots of different beats. <I>--Louise Carter</I>"	COL description VAL "Can be played with hands, sticks, or mallets and accommodates 2 or more players at a time.

The booming beat of a big bass drum is an irresistible draw for kids of all ages. This superbly made drum would be a wonderful way to call children to attention in a group setting. The top surface is made of a sturdy tan plastic material molded to look like leather, and the cylinder of the drum is made of thick pressed board with a vibrant jungle-print design in jewel-bright colors. The drum sits up slightly on molded black plastic feet to increase its deep, resonant sound. Included in the set are two 11-inch mallets of black plastic with round ends of hard foam covered in black velvet. The mallets make a wonderful deep booming sound, but the drum can also be played with the hands. Any school, camp, music program, or library would be pleased to have this excellent instrument on hand to accompany songs or add dramatic sound effects to story hours.

This process allows different grades of steel to be combined to form a single integral piece capable of withstanding extreme stress--each part of the knife is made from the grade of steel with the optimum characteristics for that component. The cutting edge features a specially designed serration pattern, ensuring prolonged sharpness without resharpening. The full-length tang (meaning the metal continues all the way through to the end of the handle) gives you a better-balanced and stronger knife. The polypropylene handle with rustproof rivets is nearly indestructible.

The Winning Moves Deluxe Pit Card Game is a hilariously frenzied game of commodities that's sure to provide hours of fun and laughter. Shout your deal and trade your cards to "corner" the market; be the first to get all the cards of one product, ring the bell and win the hand. Looking for a sure winner in the hot commodities market? Pit, the fast-paced card game from Parker Brothers, has been a bullish performer since its introduction way back in 1904. With all the ups and downs, desperate deals, and nonstop action of an actual trading floor, this lively game offers great fun without risking the family fortune. The rules are simple: Deal the cards, wait for the opening bell, scream and trade like crazy, be the first to corner a specific market (nine cards of the same suit), and ring the closing bell. Sounds pretty realistic, doesn't it? Once you've got the basic game mastered, try throwing Bull and Bear cards into the mix--that's when things get really interesting!<P> Pit comes neatly boxed with a set of durable game cards, instructions, and a heavy-duty metal bell that's great for slamming. There are rules included for a silent bidding version of the game, but jumping up and down, gesticulating wildly, and shouting yourself hoarse is half the fun. <i>--George Laney</i>"	COL description VAL "Shout your deal and trade your cards to "corner" the market.

It's hard to believe that market trading has survived almost  unchanged 100 years after the boisterously fun game of Pit was  introduced by Parker Brothers. Yet the Classic Pit Tin still captures  the flavor of making deals faster and faster, louder and louder, until  the ring of the bell announces the first successful cornering of the  market. The cards are sturdy, the artwork is lovely, the rules are  simple, and the game is wild. Put it in an attractive tin and you've  got a winner. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>"	1

His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a "no light, no pay" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come."

The game begins with players choosing one of four collectible tokens to represent their team. Sculpted out of metal, these tokens have been modeled after the most famous ships in the series: the Enterprise, the Enterprise D, the Defiant, and the Voyager. The game board is collapsible and features two sizes, giving you the option of playing a 15-minute quick game or a 40-minute extended game.<P> Teams advance around the board by answering two types of questions: traditional trivia cards and DVD-based puzzles. The trivia cards, which resemble what you might find in Trivial Pursuit, come in three different categories: green "compendium" questions, red "events" questions, and yellow "culture" questions. They vary in difficulty, and some of the tougher questions are challenging enough to stump even the most seasoned Trekkies.<P> The main attraction, however, is the interactive DVD. Filled with video clips, sound bites and images from the franchise, the DVD challenges players to answer brain-teasing Trek puzzles. With a dozen different puzzle categories, the DVD puts your knowledge of Star Trek to the test. Categories include "Spatial Anomaly," where players must identify a character based on a distorted image, and "Coded Transmission," which challenges players to decrypt a secret message.<P> <b>Something for Everyone -- From Cadets to Fleet Captains</b><br> The DVD has been designed with the fans in mind. You'll see cameos by your favorite characters, watch video clips from classic episodes, and be treated to narration by the Enterprise computer. You'll even do battle with a Romulan Warbird in the tiebreaker mode. All in all, it's a consummate Star Trek experience.<P> With hundreds of questions, Star Trek Scene It? has something for every type of Star Trek fan. It features questions from all six television shows and every motion picture (excluding the most recent 2009 film). The difficulty is also varied enough to keep everyone engaged -- from Star Trek savants to casual fans. Some of the DVD challenges are so riveting that even non-fans will enjoy themselves.<P> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> DVD, Flextime game board, Six-sided number die, eight-sided category die, 4 collectible metal tokens, 16 prime directive cards, 175 trivia cards, 4 category reference cards, and instruction sheet. <br clear="all"> <table cellpadding="10" align="center"> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-2-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-2-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-3-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-3-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> <td align="center"><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-4-sm.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br><font size="1"><b><em><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/toys/detail-page/1933318236-4-lg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href,null,'width=660,height=500'); return false;">View larger</a>.</em></b></font></td> </tr> </table> <br clear="all">"	COL description VAL "Star Trek Trivia Game Starfleet Starship 2000 NEW Enterprise Defiant Voyager"	1

Preschoolers can have so much fun picking fruit to fill their baskets, they dont even realize theyre practicing math skills, such as counting, addition and subtraction. Players choose from two different play options and take turns picking pretend cherries, blueberries, apples and oranges from their tree. If the spinner lands on a bird or a dog players will have to return cherries to their tree. Landing on a spilled bucket means they have to start the game over! Think of the Hi Ho! Cherry-O board game when it comes to a fruity fun way for kids to practice math skills! Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. Round and round she goes. Hi Ho! Cherry-O is the counting game in which players race to be the first to have 10 cherries in their basket. A spin of the arrow determines your fate. It will instruct you to pick one, two, three, or four cherries from your tree and put 'em in your basket. That is, of course, if you don't land on the bird or the dog, requiring you to take two cherries from your basket and return them to the tree. And try not to land on the spilled bucket or--you guessed it--spill the contents of your basket or you start over. <i>--Alison Golder</i>"	COL description VAL "Climb up and slide down in the exciting game of ups and downs, Chutes and Ladders! The Chutes and Ladders board game for girls and boys has been around for over 60 years and has been enjoyed by families for generations. Players can see the square marked 100, but how will they get there? If a player lands their pawn on a good deed, they can shimmy up a ladder, but land on the wrong spot and they'll shoot down a chute! No reading is required to play this simple and easy game for preschoolers. Players spin the spinner to see how many spots they'll move. Will their new spot send them down or move them up, up, up? Slip, slide and see who will win the Chutes and Ladders board game. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. Be the first to move your child-shaped playing piece from square one to square 100 on the Chutes and Ladders game board--but watch out! If you land on the square that shows you ate too much candy--Ouch!--you get a tummy ache and slide down a chute to a square a few numbers below. But if you end your turn on a good-deed square, such as helping sweep up a mess, you'll be rewarded by a ladder-climb up the board. A fantastic follow-up to <a href="/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000DMF5/${0}">Candy Land</a>, Chutes and Ladders is ideal for younger children who are still learning to take turns and just beginning to recognize numbers (the spinner stays in the single digits). It's also a gentle introduction to the higher numbers as players climb to 100 at the top of the board. And, thanks to all those chutes and ladders, it's got enough excitement to keep your 7-year-old on the edge of her seat. English and Spanish instructions are included; no reading is necessary to play. Chutes and Ladders is for two to four players. <i>--Julie Ubben</i>"	1

COL description VAL "Broan Standard Economy Series fans are versatile, compact, and economical ventilation solutions. <div class="aplus" ><div class="two-third-col"> The Broan 671 bathroom ventilation fan features a durable 50 CFM blower wheel for consistent performance in any bathroom of your home. The fan operates at only 6.0 sones. Offering either wall or ceiling installation, its compact polymer housing fits easily between ceiling joists or wall studs. Double-strength steel mounting flanges have keyhole slots for easy installation, and torsion spring grille mounting means that no tools are necessary. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. Broan ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. Today, Broan-NuTone leads the industry with forward-thinking residential ventilation products, customized climate, communications and storage solutions and superior customer service. The Broan brand focuses on range hoods, ventilation fans, heater/fan/light combination units, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) fresh air systems, built-in heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators and trash compactors, while the NuTone brand offers door chimes, central vacuum systems, stereo intercom systems, medicine cabinets, ironing centers, ceiling fans and ventilation fans."

Three models offer the ultimate in light weight and sensitivity with our proprietary GLX performance. They feature the light and virtually indestructible Recoil guides. These are not your normal shallow-water rods - these are high performance spinning and casting rods designed to fish in the skinny water where the fish come to eat. We put these rods in three groups... the "standard" Greenwater rods (GWR) for fishing live or cut bait; the "popping" Greenwater rods (GWPR) for bait or small soft plastics and the "magnum taper" Greenwater rods (GWMR) for fishing spoons, soft plastic jerkbaits and jigs. There are a few models here that are designed for bigger fish and a little deeper water. They're all light weight, sensitive and sneaky powerful!"

Corningware French White bakeware proves that when it comes to food preparation, few things are more convenient than baking and serving in one dish. With its classic, fluted design, French White oven-to-table bakeware imparts a traditional elegance that is a perfect complement to any dcor. Versatile yet stylish, Corningware French White is simple, from start to finish! Most of us have become masters of multitasking--answering phones, checking e-mail, and reading simultaneously, and Corningware follows suit with dishes designed for the microwave, oven, tabletop, dishwasher, and refrigerator. Corningware's French White bakeware combines the functionality of classic designs with contemporary styling. This 1-1/2-quart oval baking dish is ideal for pastas, casseroles, or meats, and features a glass lid with an easy-to-grasp handle (but as with all Corningware and other ceramic or glass bakeware, you'll always need to use potholders when handling the dish or its lid).

Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary. This 9-1/4-inch square baker, crafted from commercial-grade  stoneware with Le Creuset's poterie glaze, cooks up a mean hot dish and  looks good doing it. Coated inside and out with the company's signature  enamel, the dish doesn't absorb moisture and resists chips, nicks,  stains, and odors. It's oven-safe to 500 degrees F and can also go in  the freezer, refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. It even looks  good at the table. The easy-grip side handles--ridged above and lipped  underneath--provide room enough for oven-mitt-sized fingers. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>"	1

The machine&#x2019;s cleaner head has an active base place, which self-adjusts automatically for optimal contact with all floor types. On hard floors the base plate lowers to create an efficient seal, and the brush bar lifts clear off the floor to protect delicate surfaces. On carpet, the base plate rises and the brush bar lowers for optimum bristle penetration- removing ground-in dirt and pet hair from different depths of carpet pile. And because the cleaner head adjusts automatically, there are no fiddly dials and you don&#x2019;t need to bend down to make adjustments. <br><br> Dyson cyclones capture more dirt than any other cyclone. DC40 Multi floor has Radial Root Cyclone technology with remodeled airflows to maximize suction power. DC40 Multi floor also has patented Ball technology. It turns on the spot, which allows you to maneuver more easily around obstacles and into awkward spaces. And because the motor and other key components are located inside the ball, the machine has a lower center of gravity- making it even easier to steer.   <br><br>  <h4>Patented Dyson Technology</h4> <b>New Radial Root Cyclone Technology</b> Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. As you use them, the tiny holes in the bag clog up with particles of dust. This restricts the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don&#x2019;t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the bin. No bag. No loss of suction. <br>  Dyson has been continually refining cyclone technology since inventing it more than 20 years ago. DC40 Multi floor has new Radial Root Cyclone technology. Reconfigured air channels and improved flow efficiency reduce turbulence and preserve air pressure, so that the inner cyclones can extract more microscopic particles. These refinements help remove more dirt, dust, allergens and pet hair for the airflow. <br>  <br><b>Ball Technology to Help You Steer with Ease</b> Dyson Ball upright vacuum cleaners use patented Ball technology to overcome the steering limitations of fixed wheels. They ride on a ball, which turns on the spot so you can steer with ease, changing direction with just a turn of the wrist. <br><br>  The ball itself is made of glass-reinforced polypropylene- the same material used in the manufacture of car dashboards. It combines high impact strength with the resistance to distortion. The ball also holds the heaviest component, (the motor), positioned towards the base for a lower center of gravity and greater stability. <br><br>   <h4>Features</h4> <b>Self-adjusting cleaner head: </b> DC40 Multi floor has an active base plate. It creates the optimal cleaner head contact for every floor type, reducing air leaks and retaining suction power on all floor types- wood, carpet, vinyl and tile. <br><br> <b>Instant release wand: </b>DC40 Multi floor has an instant release, long reach wand for cleaning stairs and awkward areas- it stretches up to 5 times in length. There are no separate parts to assemble. <br><br> <b>Extra tools: </b>DC40 Multi floor comes with a Combination tool and a Stair tool. The Combination tool has a debris nozzle that converts to a brush tool for dusting. The Stair tool removes dirt and dust from corners and against vertical edges of stairs. <br><br> <b>Approved for allergy sufferers: </b>All new Dyson upright and canister vacuums are certified asthma & allergy friendly by the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America. Dyson cyclones capture microscopic particles down to 0.5 microns in size, including pollen, mold and bacteria. <br><br> <b>No extra costs: </b> DC40 Multi floor comes with a 5 year warranty - parts and labor guaranteed by Dyson. <br><br> </div>       <div class="half-col last"> <div class="half-col">   <div class="leftImage"><img style="max-width:95%; border:3px solid black;" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dyson/InstantWand-Use._SL500_.jpg" alt="Wand"/><div class="imageCaption">The included instant release wand stretches up to 5 times in length</div></div><br><br>  <div class="leftImage"><img style="max-width:95%; border:3px solid black" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dyson/Clear-Bin-use._SL500_.jpg" alt="Clear Bin"><div class="imageCaption">A clear bin lets you see just how much you have picked up</div></div>   <tr> <td align="center" valign="top"> <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="border:1px solid #666565" width="250"> <tbody> <tr bgcolor="#000000"> <td align="center" colspan="2" style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;font-weight:bold;color:#ffffff"> What's In The Box?</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor="#bcbec0"> <td style="font-size:12px"></td> <td style="font-size:12px">DC40 Upright Multi Floor Vacuum</td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#a7a9ac"> <td style="font-size:12px"></td> <td style="font-size:12px">Extension Wand </td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#bcbec0">  <td style="font-size:12px"></td> <td style="font-size:12px">Operating Manual</td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#a7a9ac">  <td style="font-size:12px"></td> <td style="font-size:12px">Quickstart Guide</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor="#bcbec0"> <td style="font-size:12px"></td> <td style="font-size:12px">Stair Tool</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor="#a7a9ac"> <td style="font-size:12px"></td> <td style="font-size:12px">Combination Accessory Tool </td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor="#bcbec0"> <td style="font-size:12px"></td> <td style="font-size:12px">Product Registration Card</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor="#a7a9ac"> <td style="font-size:12px"></td> <td style="font-size:12px">5-Year Warranty</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  </div>    <div class="half-col last">  <div class="leftImage"><div class="centerImage"><img style="max-width:95%; border:3px solid black;" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dyson/Cyclone_dc40-Use._SL500_.jpg" width="280" height = "340" alt="Radial Root"><div class="imageCaption">Dyson Radial Root Cyclone Technology - No bag.

COL description VAL "Rubber-Cal's recycled rolled rubber mat and flooring option that is available in 2 gauges: a 1/4 inch thick and a 3/8 inch thick. This flooring option is perfect for a variety of antivibration and floor protection applications. Because the material is domestically made with 100% recycled rubber, this mat is both socially and ecologically responsible. This product is excellent for indoor or outdoor applications due to high contents of EPDM (i.e., a UV/Ozone resistant elastomer) found in the recycled tire rubber. Recycled rubber is a superior material for reducing noise, containing vibration, and absorbing shock from workout equipment. This floor protector mat is specifically manufactured for durability and is designed for both residential and commercial applications often exposed to heavy foot traffic. Moreover, the space-age polyurethane based binder used during the manufacturing process enhances rubber's natural anti-fatigue qualities. Each washing machine vibration mat is fabricated from thousands of rubber granules and offers superior underfoot comfort and support along with a resilient cushioning for the shock of running, exercising, walking and standing. One of the biggest concerns commonly associated with rubber matting is its installation. However, this anti vibration pat weighs roughly 50lbs in a 4ft x 10ft roll and generally lies flat under its own weight; therefore there is no need for permanent adhesives."	0

It provides useful practice of addition and multiplication facts. It requires strategizing to decide how to play on each turn. That's the good news. The bad news is that the rules are rather difficult to figure out, even for an adult. But keep trying--it's a rewarding and educational game after all. Polygon uses numbered tiles that are placed on the game board in ways that achieve a score for each turn. You can play tiles in several ways so you have to add (and sometimes multiply, too) on each turn, as well as at the end of the game.

COL description VAL "The second expansion for The Lord of the Rings board game adds a whole new dimension to the game play. With the Sauron expansion, the fellowship of Hobbits are no longer competing solely against the game and its boards. In Sauron one player takes on the role of the dark lord and seeks to thwart the fellowship's crucial mission. Okay look, we've all seen the movies, many of us have read the books, and plenty of us have already played the incredibly cool <I>Lord of the Rings</I> board game designed by Reiner Knizia. And while the determined pluck of the hobbits is obviously worthy of admiration, haven't you ever thought there was something kind of cool about Sauron? Sure you might not want to admit it, or maybe you do, but the guy is in at least a partially sympathetic spot. He just wants to rule all of creation and to do that, all he needs to do is pry some jewelry away from a hobbit. With this Sauron expansion set to the original board game, players can get their chance to play the bad guy himself, employ the Black Rider, and rule them all. But beware: with this set, the pesky hobbits have some new weapons of their own. The set includes 30 Sauron cards, nine Nazgul cards, and five Fellowship cards. It's not capable of being played on its own but makes a great counterpart, and counterpoint, to the original board game. <I>--Charlie Williams</I>"	COL description VAL "Your child will love to have adventures under his or her Disney Princess and the Frog Bed Tent and Push light.

COL description VAL "Lehigh RWSBP582 Solid Braid Polypropylene Derby Rope (200 ft.)Lock stitch construction makes it a firm, round rope. Keeps its shape even under load. Feels like more expensive nylon ropes. Resists rot, mildew and abrasions. This rope floats.Lehigh RWSBP582 Solid Braid Polypropylene Derby Rope (200 ft.) Features: 5/8 in. x 200 ft. red/white Reel This 5/8-inch by 200-foot solid braid "Derby" polypropylene rope reel is great for boating, excellent for use over pulleys and winches, dog tie out, or horse leads. Because of its light weight, polypropylene (poly) is the only rope which floats, and for this reason is very popular for use as pool markers and water sports. solid braided rope stands up especially well to chafing of blocks and pulleys. The lock stitch construction of solid braid rope makes a firm, round and tightly woven rope, which prevents unraveling when cut or torn. The rope is abrasion resistant, and it resists rot and mildew. This construction cannot be spliced. Poly is affected by sunlight deterioration (more so than any other synthetic or natural fiber rope), but its life can be extended by storing it away from direct sunlight. Poly begins to weaken and melt at 150 F, the lowest melting point of all synthetic ropes. It is not as strong as nylon or polyester, but two to three times stronger than manila. Because poly is less expensive than other fibers, it is the most popular all-purpose rope for the average consumer."	COL description VAL "Thank you for visiting our store!!!
