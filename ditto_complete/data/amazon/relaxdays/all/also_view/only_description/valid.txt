COL description VAL "Guesstures is a new fast-action game from Hasbro that plays like a high-speed version of charades. Use gestures to help your team guess the word printed on the card. But you only have a few seconds and you can't say a word. When they guess correctly, grab your card before it gets swallowed up by the word-hungry Mimer-Timer. Second edition includes more cards and categories and provides quick word fun for everyone. Game includes 504 cards with card box, Mimer-Timer game unit, crayon, 2 label sheets and instructions. Guesstures turns up the heat on the tired game of charades with a few modernizations. Good, quick pantomiming is still the thing, but now teams need to act out and guess four words in a matter of seconds. The "mimer-timer," designed like a movie scene board, controls everything. The actor draws four word cards and places them from easiest to hardest in the timer unit for each scene. After the arm swings down for "Action," time is rapidly eaten away and so are cards as the performer gestures wildly like a silent movie actor. When the cast guesses the word, the actor grabs the card before the "mimer-timer" does. Whew! It's a lot to think about. Each word is rated based on difficulty, so whatever cards the team correctly guesses <I>and</I> the actor manages to seize are tallied up and recorded. <i>--Lynne Sampson</i>"	COL description VAL "Guesstures turns up the heat on the tired game of charades with a few modernizations.

Dimensions: -Overall Product Weight:10.2 We all know that cats dislike water, but many dogs are also skittish when it comes to baths, running and hiding at the first drip from the hose. Unfortunately, that doesnt stop pets from getting into the garbage, rolling in the dirt (or worse), or tangling with wild critters. Lenteks waterless pet bath brush provides an alternative to the traditional bath. Pets relax for a brushing session--something most animals do like--as the pet brush soundlessly circulates 100 trillion air-cleansing ions per second through the animals fur to remove even the nastiest odors. Operating via one 9-volt battery (not included), a flashing green light indicates that the brush is on, while a red light warns that the battery is getting low on power. One complete brushing cycle lasts 5 minutes before the tool automatically shuts off. The bath brush has soft plastic bristles, and additional heads--with either plastic or metal bristles--are sold separately. <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>"	COL description VAL "The Chris Christensen Purple Ionic Brass and Nylon brushes are made with solid brass inner bristles to distribute natural oils.

All birdbath/fountain bases, bench legs & statuary should be raised up off the ground in winter so they will not freeze to the ground surface. Ideally, a fountain should be stored indoors in the winter away from the elements. However, if a fountain bowl must be left outside, remove all pumps, rubber stoppers, drain pipes, finials & small components, & cover the top with burlap or any absorbent material (old blanket/towel) & then wrapped with dark plastic, making sure that water does not accumulate in the basin & freeze.

ZWILLING Special Formula, high carbon no-stain steel blades are FRIODUR ice-hardened to be durable, stay sharp, and not rust. Classic Triple Riveted Handle for comfort, durability and strength. Made in Spain, lifetime warranty. From one of Henckels' moderately priced cutlery lines, these four steak knives will divide any rib-eye, chop, or roast into bite-size pieces. The thin, curved blades are perfect for precise cutting, though their fine serrations tend to tear meat fibers rather than slice neatly through them. Stamped from high-carbon stainless steel, these knives are lighter in weight than forged knives and don't have bolsters, which might not be essential when confronting a thick prime rib.

COL description VAL "Most water problems are invisible to the eye. Quickly measure and modify the six aquarium levels that are most important to the health of your freshwater fish with the API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT. To stay healthy and thrive, fish need properly balanced levels of ammonia, pH, high range pH, nitrite and nitrate. These levels can change rapidly and create harmful conditions when fish waste, uneaten food or other organic matter accumulate, or when untreated water is added. If left uncorrected, all of these can be harmful or even fatal to fish, with consequences such as reduction of oxygen, increase in stress and higher risk of disease. The API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT measures these six parameters with scientific accuracy and provides professional results. It comes with four glass test tubes, a holding tray, test tube rack and computer calibrated, laminated color card. Just fill the test tubes, add the test drops and compare results to the color card. Then follow the recommendations on the card if action is required. With API Aquarium products, its easy to keep a beautiful saltwater, freshwater or reef aquarium. For over 50 years, API has been creating innovative, research-driven solutions that make it easier to care for your fish and aquarium.

COL description VAL "This lightning fast professional home sharpener creates, in seconds, the novel Trizor-Plus edge which can be customized to suit each cutting task! It sharpens straight-edge and serrated knives and is so easy to use, anyone can put astonishingly sharp, long-lasting edges on knives in seconds. You can select extremely sharp hair-splitting edges that slide smoothly and effortlessly through delicate foods like smoked salmon and prosciutto or alternately, edges with varying amounts of bite for more demanding jobs, like cutting tough fibrous foods and meats. 100% fine diamond-coated conical disks in Stage 1 and Stage 2 form the first and second bevels of a durable, arch-shaped edge. In Stage 3, a revolutionary flexible stropping disk creates an ultrasharp polished third bevel and cutting tip while polishing the first two bevels to form sharp cutting flutes that enhance the cutting action on both sides of the edge. Built-in high-precision elastomeric angle guides eliminate guesswork and ensure hair-splitting sharpness time after time. Its ruggedly built and backed by a limited 3-year warranty. The unit is compact approximately 10 long x 4 x 4. Resilient elastomer feet hold the unit securely to the work surface. The ChefsChoice Diamond Hone EdgeSelect Plus Model 120 requires no sharpening oils or liquids. Engineered and assembled in the USA. It may seem like a contradiction, but sharp knives are the safest. With a clean edge, a knife is more predictable and easier to control. If you've purchased a top-of-the-line knife, maintaining the quality of the blade ensures maximum value from your investment. This Chef's Choice knife sharpener performs professional-quality sharpening on any knife, from gourmet knives to hunting knives--even serrated knives can be sharpened with this machine. For top-quality edges, there are two sharpening and honing stages, which use 100 percent diamond abrasives, and a final polishing stage. Each stage uses precision angle guides to create a unique Trizor-Plus edge for maximum sharpness and durability, while a magnetic pad collects residue so the machine is easy to clean and maintain. While a sharp knife is indeed a safe knife, it's wise to use caution with your newly sharpened knives, as they'll be sharper than you expect. <it>--Laura Cuthbert</it><P> <B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr> <td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/smallappliances/chefschoice-120-serrate.gif </td> <td> For all fine-edge knives, and even serrated knives (as demonstrated in the image), the Chef's Choice 120 three-stage diamond hone professional sharpener lets you select the edge to match the need.

The filament inside an incandescent lamp must be protected so that oxygen does not reach it and cause it to evaporate on contact. Most incandescent lamps are either vacuum-sealed or gas-filled. Incandescent lamp filaments are made of tungsten. Tungsten is a metal that can operate at very high temperatures without evaporating too quickly an resulting in early lamp failure. Incandescent filaments only convert about 10 percent of the energy used into visible light, so it is necessary to use a material that can withstand extremely high temperatures. Most lamps use a coiled filament design, which has been found to be stronger and deliver better performance."	0

COL description VAL "The Perfect-a-Flow Undergravel Filter is a biological filtration system for fresh or saltwater aquariums. The filter circulates water through the gravel bed and oxygenates it for beneficial bacteria growth. The slots on the filter plate have been designed to draw water evenly over the entire plate from front to back and left to right. The high tube connectors are molded into the filter plates to offer a secure grip onto the one-inch diameter lift tubes to keep the tubes from being knocked out by fish and preventing gravel from falling under the filter plate. There are three tube holders and caps. The Perfect-A-Flo air stoneprovides a  flow of fine bubbles. A 3/16 inch ridged tube connects to the air diffuser inside the uplift tube and will attach to airline tubing at the top of the uplift tube. When using an airpump and airstones use two uplift tubes per plate.  The fish protector is molded right into each elbow to prevent fish from entering the uplift tubes.  The Perfect-A-Flo Carbon Cartridge (not included) will fit into the fish protector.  These cartridges contain top-quality activated carbon to remove harmful gases, odors, and unsightly discoloration.For powerhead attachment place the one-inch uplift tube on the outside tube holder. The powerhead should have a flow rate of 100-140gph. Use one uplift tube per plate when using a powerhead. Using a powerhead provides a higher flow rate which cuts down on algae growth and requires less maintenance, however, powerheads are harder to conceal."

He certainly looks ursine with his big thick beard and burly build and he sports the image of a big snarling bear on his red and gray shield. Santis also wields a silver sword, which is sure to protect him in case he runs up against any actual bears.

Made in Solingen, Germany, home of W&#xFC;sthof since 1814, Gourmet blades are precision-cut by laser from sheets of high-carbon, stain-resistant steel, resulting in a slightly thinner profile and lighter weight than the company's revered forged steel blades.

The shorter of two boning knives, this one features a narrow, five-inch blade formed in the traditional S-curve with a very sharp tip. The blade on this particular model is on the stiff side, which makes it better for boning beef; W&#xFC;sthof's more flexible model excels at poultry.

The infamous German industrial designers, Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs were the masterminds behind the project; and, with their "Less, is more" design philosophy they produced a number of memorable products for Braun including some of the best travel alarm clocks around. Over the last 40 years, Braun time pieces were characterized by their pure, highly functional and timeless design with no superfluous details: Every feature directly reflects a function. Rooted in over half a century of modern design at Braun, the core values of functionality, quality and aesthetics are reflected in all clocks and watches. The strength of clarity and simplicity of their design makes them a pleasure to use and to own. The analogue clocks were manufactured with the intention to prioritize innovation and durability. The beautifully sleek structure and dial illumination, together with the slight graying back of the numbers ensures that the hour arms are clear and easily readable. All the clocks use precision German movements, known for their silent nature and high accuracy. A variety of models use radio controlled movements for complete accuracy of time. A selection of the very best classic clocks and watches have been recreated in keeping with the high standards of quality of the originals. At the same time, brand new designs on both watches and clocks take the collection further than ever before"	0

COL description VAL "Play a card from your hand, place a chip on the corresponding space on the game surface. With touches of canasta, rummy, and poker, this game could easily become a Friday-night favorite. The object is to get a "sequence," meaning a row of five poker-like chips on the game board. The board itself depicts lines of face-up playing cards. Players place their "crowning" chips on top of the card pictures, and can form sequences by using strategy and knowing which Sequence cards to keep or discard. Since forethought, luck, and backup plans are the keys to winning, this game is probably too sophisticated for children under 7 years old. (But young ones can team up with adults.) Included are 104 playing cards and 50 crowning chips in each color: red, blue, and green. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>"	COL description VAL "Play a card from your hand, then place a peg on a corresponding card shown on the board.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

COL description VAL "Most water problems are invisible to the eye. Quickly measure and modify the six aquarium levels that are most important to the health of your freshwater fish with the API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT. To stay healthy and thrive, fish need properly balanced levels of ammonia, pH, high range pH, nitrite and nitrate. These levels can change rapidly and create harmful conditions when fish waste, uneaten food or other organic matter accumulate, or when untreated water is added. If left uncorrected, all of these can be harmful or even fatal to fish, with consequences such as reduction of oxygen, increase in stress and higher risk of disease. The API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT measures these six parameters with scientific accuracy and provides professional results. It comes with four glass test tubes, a holding tray, test tube rack and computer calibrated, laminated color card. Just fill the test tubes, add the test drops and compare results to the color card. Then follow the recommendations on the card if action is required. With API Aquarium products, its easy to keep a beautiful saltwater, freshwater or reef aquarium. For over 50 years, API has been creating innovative, research-driven solutions that make it easier to care for your fish and aquarium. API Aquarium Treatment Supplies are designed to work in conjunction with each other to provide best results to control algae, promote healthy bacterial growth and help control and cure fish diseases and conditions such as ich and fin rot.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

Each player picks a colored piece in pink, green, blue, or purple and takes a turn spinning the wheel on the jewelry box to advance around the circular game board. Each space on the board guides the player to pick a piece of jewelry that matches the color of his or her playing piece, or to put one back in the jewelry box. The goal is to be decked out in full princess regalia. There is only one crown, and it can also be picked from the jewelry box or off the royal brow of some other would-be princess. Aspiring sovereigns should beware the black ring--you definitely don't want to be stuck with it at the end of the game. The game includes plastic bracelets, necklaces, rings, earrings, a crown, and a jewelry box with a spinner and a mirror. There are "jewel" stickers to decorate the jewelry box and the crown (but the stickers should not be put on skin or clothing). There's a charming simplicity in this game for little ones who dream of being a princess.

COL description VAL "J.A. Henckels has been manufacturing top quality knives since its founding in Solingen, Germany, more than 260 years ago. Today, the company is known the world over for the superior craftsmanship and quality of its cutlery. Simple, heavy duty and functional, all Henckels knives are made from high carbon, no-stain steel and crafted using the FRIODUR ice-hardening process for maximum blade strength and a long-lasting edge. Hygenic and slip-resistant, the polypropylene handles are seamlessly fitted to the bolster for safety and comfort during use. Knives in the Five Star series feature a special "no-corners" ergonomic handle for an especially comfortably grip and minimal fatigue of the hand. Full tang extends throughout the handle. Dishwasher safe. This knife is great for cleaning, paring, peeling and slicing small fruits and vegetables and preparing intricate garnishes. The super-sharp 4-inch cutting edge and ergonomic handle make this a top-notch paring knife. Forged in Solingen, Germany, of a combination of ice-hardened carbon and stainless steel for edge retention, rust-resistance, and durability, this versatile little knife ends up doing almost all the knife-work you'd rather not--or can't--do with your chef's knife: peeling, cutting, shaping, and prepping fruit, veggies, and meat. When it is finally time to sharpen the slim blade of this knife, worry not, for it lends itself well to both a sharpening stone and steel. Once you've achieved the edge you want, a few quick sweeps along a steel each time you use the knife should keep the edge in fine condition. The ergonomic polypropylene handle lies comfortably in your hand, facilitating strain-free use; the metal bolster acts as a finger-guard; and the blade, bolster, and tang are fused into a seamless piece for easy handling and balance. The absence of rivets and recesses in the synthetic handle allows for dishwasher use. Finally! Still, the best way to care for this knife is to hand wash it with a mild soap, rinse it well, and then immediately wipe it dry. <i>--Marcela Broussard </i> <P><B>From the Manufacturer</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fivestar.lifestyle.jpg </td> <td> The TWIN Five Star range is a masterful blend of sharpness and ergonomic design.

WaterDog senses your dog's approach, and automatically dispenses a cool, clean stream of fresh drinking water. Smart sonar sensing technology triggers the WaterDog to turn the water on when your pet comes within 3 feet (1 meter), and turns it off when your pet leaves. You'll never have to worry about what your dog's been drinking again. Constructed of durable, high-quality UV resistant materials, the WaterDog has been designed to provide many years of reliable service. The WaterDog's hose has a metal covering to protect it from chewing and to reflect heat to help keep the water cool, even on bright sunny days.

If your dog does not return he receives a static correction which is startling but not harmful. With simple training your dog will quickly learn his boundaries - typically within approximately 2 weeks. The training of your pet is a key element with the PetSafe Wireless Fence. Follow the easy instruction and training manual that is included. For use in the U.S. only. This unit is compatible with all US 120V outlets and are not to be used with 220V international voltage.

We cannot be responsible in the case that the plants are confiscated at customs. Century plant (Agave americana) is naturalised in many parts of Australia, but has a somewhat scattered distribution. It has been recorded from many parts of Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and south-eastern South Australia. It is also naturalised on Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. Because it is very difficult to collect, herbarium records probably greatly underestimate the actual distribution of this species in Australia. Possibly also naturalised in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Two varieties (i.e. Agave americana var. americana and Agave americana var. expansa) and one cultivar (i.e. Agave americana 'Marginata') have been recorded amongst naturalised populations in Australia. Some state herbaria do not distinguish between these taxa, so the actual ditributions of different varieties is not well known.

This 128-piece construction set features easy-to-assemble interlocking gears, bases and connectors that are compatible with all other Gears!Gears!Gears! sets. Children create an intricate maze of colorful interlocking and spinning gears that turns out looking like the magical machinery in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. The building process is easy and certainly a big part of the creative pleasure children will find in this toy. The idea is to stack and interconnect gears, using pillars, axles, and adapter pegs. The written instructions will be challenging for many children under 9 years old, but once adults show children how to get started, kids should have no problem taking off with their own factory plans. Gears come in an abundance of sizes and bright colors (along with psychedelic decals). The instruction sheet suggests three experiments for exploring how gears spin, how to gauge spinning speed, and how to understand gear ratios. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>"	1
COL description VAL "Durable fiberglass-nylon handles--they fit the hand snugly and are subtly pebble grained to resist slipping when wet--distinguish Grand Prix knives from W&uuml;sthof's other cutlery lines. Otherwise Grand Prix knives are identical to other W&uuml;sthof knives, embodying all the virtues that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. The blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as on some knives. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. The four knives in this set exemplify control while providing a cook with the essentials: an 8-inch cook's knife (chef's knife) for rocking through chopping and mincing tasks; a 6-inch sandwich knife for myriad slicing and cutting needs; a 7-inch serrated bread knife for crusty loaves; and a 3-1/2-inch paring knife for fruits and vegetables. The set also includes a sharpening steel for keeping knife edges aligned, kitchen shears, and an oak block with three extra knife slots to store everything on the counter within reach.

Here the gifted Russian scientist Dmitry Vinogradov independently discovered the secret of making Russian porcelain and developed the technology for its manufacture and the later creation of Lomonosov Russia.<br/><br/>Three hundred years ago no one in Europe had any idea of the materials and techniques used in making porcelain. The Chinese kept the secrets of porcelain production. Only in the early 18th century in Saxony the alchemist Johan F. Bottger discovered a way to produce "European" hard paste porcelain. These developments did not escape the notice of Peter I. During his frequent visits to European countries, Peter I pursued his interest in the secrets of porcelain manufacture and he attempted to introduce it to Russia with the help of foreigners, but unsuccessfully. Peter I's idea to establish his own porcelain production was brought to life two decades later by his daughter, who was then Empress Elizabeth (1741-1761)."	0

Sharpens the entire edge of kitchen, fishing, hunting and pocket-knives. Safe for quality knives. Acclaimed worldwide by serious cooks and renowned chefs. Two year limited warranty. UL/ETL and Canadian Approval. Assembled in the U.S.A. It may seem like a contradiction, but sharp knives are the safest. With a clean edge, a knife is more predicable and easier to control. If you've purchased a top-of-the-line knife, maintaining the quality of the blade ensures maximum value from your investment. This Chef's Choice knife sharpener performs professional-quality sharpening on any knife, from gourmet knives to hunting knives--even the tips of serrated knives can be improved with this machine (for a complete sharpening of serrated knives, however, Chef's Choice recommends models 120 and 320). For top-quality edges, there are two sharpening and honing stages, which use 100% diamond abrasives, and a final polishing stage. Each stage uses precision angle guides to create a unique "Trizor-Plus" edge for maximum sharpness and durability, while a magnetic pad collects residue so the machine is easy to clean and maintain. While a sharp knife is indeed a safe knife, it's wise to use caution with your newly sharpened knives, as they'll be sharper than you expect. <I>--Laura Cuthbert</I>"	COL description VAL "This professional electric 2-Stage knife sharpener sharpens both straight edge and serrated knives to better than factory edges, in just minutes. When your favorite knives start squishing ripe tomatoes instead of slicing them, it's time to sharpen your blades. This knife sharpener is remarkably easy to use on both straight-edge and serrated knives. Simply plug it in, turn it on, and feed knife blades through the stages. The first sharpening stage uses 100 percent diamond abrasive disks to hone the knife's edge while the second stage incorporates polymer disks to polish and strop the edge to hairsplitting sharpness. Straight-edge knives should go through both stages, while serrated blades should only be used in the polishing stage. The internal elastomeric spring guides hold knife blades at just the right angle to the sharpening surfaces, making sharpening easy. The instructions are easy to follow, and maintenance is limited to removing the metal dust shavings from the clean-out tray once a year or so; no lubrication is necessary for the motor, bearings, or sharpening surfaces. Guaranteed not to detemper, the sharpener has a two-year warranty for home use. <i>--Ariel Meadow Stallings</i>"	1
COL description VAL "Infuse your chicken with intriguing flavors using this vertical roaster. It will be the most flavorful and moist chicken you've ever had! Made of quality stainless steel, this roaster begins with a vertical roasting stand that attaches to a large, round drip tray (the stand collapses for easy storage). In the center of the drip tray sits a round dish with cone shaped top. Fill the round dish with herbs, spices, cider, juices or beer; as your chicken rests on the stand, the aromas and flavors from the liquids and herbs pass through the perforations on the cone shaped top, filling the cavity of the bird and adding moisture to the meat as it roasts. Instructions on using the vertical roaster are included. If your last experiment with a vertical roaster led to the bird tipping on its tripod base and landing in the grease pouring out of its cavity, here's a chance to get it right. This Norpro model is versatile enough to serve as a horizontal 13-by-8-1/2-inch rack for roasts. And it easily but sturdily converts to vertical roasting by anchoring up to four hooked pieces to the slats of the flat rack, enabling two birds to roast on this roost, cooking evenly inside and out, with no danger of capon cartwheel. Flipping the bird, so to speak, is a thing of the past--there's no need to pull the rack out of the oven halfway through cooking--and you may as well roast two while you have the heat cranked up (put one in the freezer for next week). Cleanup is fairly easy, too; just be sure to use a nonabrasive sponge or squeegee to preserve the nonstick coating. <i>--Tony Mason</i>"	COL description VAL "Norpro S/S Vertical Poultry Roaster This roaster will allow you to infuse your chicken with flavors and it will help produce moist chicken.

The deep drip tray collects the fat so that it doesn't coat your oven, although putting a baking sheet under the roaster is advisable for larger birds. The vertical roaster promotes even cooking, since all sides are exposed to the oven's heat.

Our proprietary process produces a resilient, responsive foam completely unlike traditional memory foam.

High loft and firm options will feel lighter and more responsive than their memory foam counterparts. <br/><br/><b>Pillow Construction</b><br/> Z Talalay Latex pillows are created through an ecofriendly manufacturing process using latex derived from sustainable rubber trees. The milky sap tapped from these tropical trees is whipped, poured into a mold, chilled, and finally heated to set the unique foam consistency. The zoned technology combines comfort and support by way of a pin-core design configured to cradle your head while providing your neck and shoulders with needed support. Due to its proprietary production process, Talalay is the most resilient and consistent latex. <br/><br/><b>Breathable Cover</b><br/> The 100 percent natural cotton removable cover offers a crisp, clean, and breathable pillow surface. <br/><br/><b>Pillow Unpackaging</b><br/> All foam products will have a slight (and harmless) smell when you first receive them - this will dissipate in a few days. <br/><br/><b>5-Year U.S. Warranty</b><br/>We offer a 5-year U.S. warranty that protects the pillow and cover against manufacturer defect."	0

This knife is made from a single piece of high quality CROMOVA 18 stainless steel with a square tip and an ultra sharp blade. The ice tempered, convex edge can hold a sharper edge for a longer time so you can slice vegetables and make a delicious bowl of pasta primavera. It has an ergonomic handle with a dimple pattern making it comfortable and slip resistant, useful for repetitive slicing. The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. This knife can be used in place of a Santoku knife so you can also cut meats and fruits. 5-1/2" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 5-1/2-inch knife for precisely slicing and chopping vegetables is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	1

And it's great to draw a lyric that's in a song title, but if you don't know five others that come after, you'll be like the player who drew "nice"; he spent the entire run of the sand timer with his shoulders hunched like Sinatra because he couldn't connect "and let's make all the stops along the way" with the song's title, "Nice 'N' Easy." Oh, and don't play Encore with Renaissance Faire actors--when they draw the word "lady," they'll come up with an inexhaustible supply of 15th-century madrigals. Only after they've won will you discover that they were all bogus. <I>--Tony Mason</I>"	1

This collection brings together the Brute Tough hammer drill/driver (13618), 6-1/2-inch circular saw (1662), reciprocating saw (1644), a flashlight (3453), two 2.4Ah Bluecore Batteries (BAT181), and a 30-minute dual bay charger (BC230). <b>About Bosch's Bluecore Batteries</b><BR> Bosch takes its popular drill/drivers and combo kits to the next level with Bluecore Battery Technology. Bosch is so confident that users will get up to 50-percent longer battery life, that it is offering a 2-year battery guarantee with ProVantage. Bluecore Batteries were engineered with internal cooling rods placed between the battery cells to absorb damaging heat. That way, the battery cells stay cooler during operation and charging as compared with standard batteries which heat up quickly, speeding up chemical breakdown and shortening battery life. Bluecore batteries can charge in 30 minutes while other batteries take up to three hours to charge when hot. And best of all, all Bluecore batteries are compatible with current Bosch cordless tools. This particular combo kit comes with the four major tools, plus two of these Bluecore batteries -- and a magnetic bit holder, side handle, 18-tooth carbide blade, two reciprocating saw blades, a double-ended bit, and a carrying bag to keep everything together."

Life is never dull when there are people around who know what baking ingredient, sprayed at high pressure, the U.S. Air Force replaced its toxic paint stripper with. Or what male body part <I>Mademoiselle</I> magazine found to be the favorite of most women. The object of the game is to show off one's general knowledge--that is, it's to move along a circular track, answering questions, and to collect colored wedges for correct answers in six categories: People and Places, Arts and Entertainment, History, Science and Nature, Sports and Leisure, and Wild Card. The game includes a 20-by-20-inch game board, question-and-answer cards in two card storage boxes, dice, six plastic tokens, and 36 scoring wedges. For two to six players or teams.

Baking soda and eyes!) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I>"	COL description VAL "Celebrate all things trivial from the past 20 years with this anniversary edition of Trivial Pursuit. Contains 3,600 all-new questions spanning 1982-2002. Question categories include: Global View, The Written Word, Sound & Screen, Innovations, News and Game Time. Includes game board, special anniversary card dispenser, question and answer cards, 1 die, 6 tokens and 36 scoring wedges. Includes winning question from the Be in the Trivial Pursuit Game contest. For 2-6 adult players. Made in USA. If you remember playing the popular original in the early '80s, you may want to get this Trivial Pursuit 20th Anniversary edition for nostalgic reasons. If you remember a lot of the last two decades, you'll want to get this edition to test yourself. Moving around the circular board, players collect wedges for correct answers to questions on "all things trivial from the past 20 years." Examples are: What tennis star was forced to do sit-ups in her crib? What became the third nation in the Western Hemisphere to hit a population of 100 million? What was the last <I>Dune</I> novel to be written by Frank Herbert? These and the remaining questions are distributed from a fancy new card shoe that is included.

COL description VAL "Also called a Honing Steel. The Global G 45 Ceramic Sharpener is used to hone the blade of kitchen knives. It will maintain a sharp edge with daily use. Despite the name, sharpening steels don't actually sharpen  knives--unless they're diamond steels. Instead, they perform the vital  task of realigning, or resetting, edges, which bend when contacting a  cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool is made of  harder-than-steel ceramic it performs better and quicker than most  steels. Using the sharpener often--before each time a knife is employed  is ideal--prevents a blade from becoming dull and prolongs intervals  between professional sharpenings, or the need of a whetstone or other  true sharpening device. Like Global's signature knife handles, the  ceramic sharpener's handle is molded for comfort and dimpled for a safe  grip. The rule is that a realigning tool should be at least as long as  the knife blade being drawn across it, and this sharpener's 9-1/2-inch  rod is long enough for most household knives. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "The best way to sharpen any knives, not just Global is by whetstone. But for fine tuning and honing you can use Global's Ceramic Sharpening Rod. The ceramic rods are used in the same way that traditional steels are used to sharpen other knives and are suitable for sharpening all good quality knives. Prolongs intervals between professional sharpening Perfect for keeping Global knife edges in shape Stainless-steel handle molded for comfort, dimpled for safe grip."	1

It is often called the "dream stone" for its ability to help one access the non-physical spirit realms. It is a protective stone, and acts as a ward against negative energies. Jade is a stone of the heart. As such it is related to the heart chakra and has a beneficial effect on all heart chakra related issues. So, of course, it can attract and enhance love of all kinds. It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy. Jade can be used as a dream-enhancer by slipping a mala of it under your pillow or inside your pillow case while sleeping.

This is done by reciting Mantras as prescribed by Vedas (Hindu Holy Books), as well as Homa for the respective Devi/Devta (God/Godess) as per Purpose of Yantra and Mala. ONLY WATER FROM RIVER GANGA (GANGES) IS USED FOR THE ENERGIZATION PURPOSE. Please note: Color, shape, size & texture of the FREE pouch may vary. Total number of beads 108.

As the battle for the planet rages, patterns of the Force converge where only Jedi or Sith can emerge victorious.

For warriors who need to be prepared at any moment to duel with Sith Lords or enemies of the Republic, this weapon swiftly extends to over three feet long with the sliding of a button, and then it's ready to help save the galaxy. The spring-activated blade is made with translucent blue plastic. Built-in segments fully retract into the handle, and the blade is illuminated with bands of light. While it's intended for use against another lightsaber -- and not a person or animal -- the blade is built from a safer, softer plastic than the durable, hard plastic handle, just in case. The silver handle features dynamic looking black, gold, and red accents.<P>  <b>Realistic Sounds</b><br> For over 30 years, Stars Wars fans the world over have been inspired to make their own lightsaber sound effects, but now, the Force Action Lightsaber does it for you. The toy creates the distinctive power-activated "humming" drone that creates anticipation in moments between swings. This lightsaber also replicates the burst of electricity as the saber turns on and the blade extends as well as the "wave" of the blade as it hovers through the air.<P>  <b>Using the Force</b><br> Unlike the lightsabers of the Star Wars movie, the toy doesn't retract with the push of a button. After turning the weapon off, the blade can be collapsed by hand -- but be careful not to jam the blade too tightly into the handle. A couple of times while playing with the lightsaber, the blade did not extend when the power was activated; the sound effects started up, but the "on" button had to be pressed more than once to get the blade out. The on/off button looks as if it should also control the volume of the lightsaber -- but it does not. Parents who get sick of the "humming" can remove the batteries, as the lightsaber requires three AA batteries (not included) for its lights and sounds. But Obi-Wan Kenobi's Lightsaber wouldn't be half the fun without its glowing arc-wave energy blade, and the blue light is especially mesmerizing in the dark. While it's always exciting to fight against villains, the lightsaber is a great toy for young Jedis learning to wield the Force on their own.<P>  <br clear="all">"	COL description VAL "Mega Bloks Harmony SmurfDeep in the forest very far from here lies a magical village full of mushroom-shaped houses and our tiny blue friends that stand three apples high The Smurfs!

Uses one 100 watt medium base bulb. 18.5" height x 7" width x 8.5" depth. Motion-activated lights are convenient and energy efficient, but they can be a little bulky and awkward to look at-in the driveway is fine, but you wouldn't want to put one on your porch. Unless it's one of Heath Zenith's porch lights, that is. These products give you the best of both worlds, combining motion-activation and traditional outdoor-light design. The SL-4192 is a six-sided wall-mount lantern that includes a hidden motion-sensing device that detects movement in a 180-degree radius up to a distance of 30 feet. You can set the light timer to one, five, or ten minutes, and the sensor itself may be adjusted to give you more or less sensitivity (so it doesn't light up every time a car drives by). The weather-resistant aluminum construction means it's going to look good for a while, too. This model also features "Dual Brite" lighting, which means you can use it for low-level accent lighting in addition to the full-light effect you get with motion-activation. An included timer allows you to set low-light mode for three hours, six hours, or dusk to dawn (an automatic photocell deactivates the unit in daylight). You can also turn the light on and off at will via the manual override that mounts to an existing indoor switch. If you're looking to save a little money on outdoor lighting by installing a motion-detector, this is a great option that won't look out of place.

Otherwise Classic knives are identical to other W&uuml;sthof knives, embodying all the virtues that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high- carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. Blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as some knives'. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. With its long, narrow blade, this 10-inch knife neatly cuts the biggest ham into thin slices. It also can be used for roasts, poultry, and smoked salmon. Alternating hollows on each side of the blade create air pockets, allowing slices to fall away cleanly and permitting thinner slicing.

COL description VAL "Released in 1999, this edition of Monopoly celebrated the new millennium. Monopoly has been popular for most of the 20th century. (How many games have that claim to fame?) Here's a Monopoly set for the next century, packaged in a nifty square metal box with signature character Mr. Monopoly on top. The rules are the same, but all of the game's components have clever new twists to celebrate the millennium. The board is made of silver holographic foil; the money is transparent; the houses and hotels have a new futuristic shape; and the tokens are little icons of turn-of-the-century life: a computer, a cell phone, an in-line skate, a globe, a jet, a sleek car, an all-terrain bicycle, and a dog (this time it's a yellow Lab instead of a Scottie). <I>--Marcie Bovetz</I>"	COL description VAL "Monopoly: Here and Now Edition is a whole new twist on the classic property trading game. The back of the box poses the question, "What would the Monopoly game be like if it were invented today?" One could sum up most of the difference in one word: inflation. If you're used to playing the traditional game, you might feel a little woozy handling Monopoly money denominations that start at $100k and top out at $5 million. Players are no longer vying for control of Atlantic city but now the entire U.S., from sea to shining sea. Entry level properties like Baltic and Mediterranean Avenues, which sold for $60 back in the day, have been replaced by Texas Stadium in Dallas and Cleveland's Jacobs Field, each selling for $600,000. The most disturbing piece of property for sale in this game is the White House--one can only assume it's someone's subtle political humor. Railroads have been replaced by airports like O'Hare and JFK. Utilities have been supplanted by cell phone and Internet service. And, of course, the game pieces have all been updated: laptop, cell phone, hybrid car, commuter coffee mug, jumbo jet, super size fries. Gameplay, however, is still the same. The idea is to buy properties, build houses and hotels, and charge other players rent when they land on your land. Thankfully, transactions are still handled in cash and not by some convoluted electronic banking scheme. There's a lot of changes here that will make cynics and traditionalists sour. That's okay. The original game is still available to them. What's interesting about this edition is that it brings back a kind of jaw-dropping thrill--one that made this game a household word in the middle of the Great Depression, when people dreamt of becoming a millionaires. This game will let you dream of becoming a billionaire. <i>--Porter B. Hall</i>"	1

Our customers say: "Ryan (5) feels very important getting all his vegetables in and then helping me." - Saskatchewan, Canada <b>Play as friends, not as enemies!</b> Family Pastimes games foster the spirit of cooperation. Players help each other climb a mountain, make a community, complete a space exploration... They never play against each other. After all, the initial impulse to play a game is social; that is, we bring out a game because we want to do something together. How ironic then that in most games, we spend all our efforts trying to bankrupt someone, destroy their armies - in other words, to get rid of one another! At <b>Family Pastimes</b> we believe that people of different ages and abilities should be able to play side by side, each making their best contribution. We are all there together when we finish the game to take joy in our successes and wonder how we might work together even better the next time we play. Thus, Family Pastimes games will prove to be a friendly form of fun. Socialization, entertainment, academic learning, character growth, etc. - whatever your objectives, we invite you to realize them by cooperative means. We hope you enjoy playing and learning together! Children learn the benefits of cooperation in this innovative game from Family Pastimes. Each player tends a small garden composed of four different types of vegetables. The object is for all players to harvest all the vegetables before winter arrives. If one of the four colors comes up when the color-coded die is thrown, then each player may harvest one vegetable of that color from his or her own garden or from any of the other gardens. If the die comes up black, each player may choose which color vegetable to pick. If the die shows a white dot, then a Winter piece must be placed on the board. The game ends when all players harvest all vegetables, or when all six Winter pieces are filled in. Cooperation is encouraged with a few special rules: if a player's garden has been completely harvested and he or she rolls the white dot, then a winter piece is <i>removed</i>. Players are thus subtly encouraged to concentrate on one garden at a time, instead of each tending only to their own gardens. <I>--Michael Fehlauer</I>"	COL description VAL "An exciting fantasy game offering a thoughtful and imaginative play experience!

As players move their pieces around the board, they uncover tools such as a boat, key, or magic potion. These are used to get past six obstacles that guard the princess: a moat, a guard dog, a sentry, a locked door, a dark tunnel, and a magic spell. It's a race against time, because in addition to objects, the board contains spaces that advance the coming of the night and the end of the game.

His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a "no light, no pay" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come."	0

These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag: <strong><font color=CC6600>Buy for Cold</font></strong><br> It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10. Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for "warm" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night. <strong><font color=CC6600>Goose or No Goose?</font></strong><br> The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly <i>and</i> stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use. All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget. <strong><font color=CC6600>Bags for All Shapes</font></strong><br> Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips. <strong><font color=CC6600>Pad Yourself</font></strong><br> No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you.

At the time our house consisted of a bunch of good friends, a half pipe, pool table, ping pong table and shaping room all just across the street from some nice smooth hills down to the reefs. One of our friends from Hawaii who used to call people "nine balls" all the time in a friendly razzing sort of way, called up on the phone one day to see what was going on at the house. He got the answering machine and said "What's going on over there at Sector 9?" which to him and us meant a house full of nine balls. The message on the machine was heard and the name not only had a nice ring to it but seemed fitting as well so it stuck. The interest had been apparent from everyone who saw us skate by so we started making skateboards in our backyard. Lots of learning and a couple evictions later we were forced to move into our first warehouse in what would become the Sector 9 skateboard factory. Since then we have continued to push our designs and materials to their limits in order to offer the best quality skateboard for all types of riding"	COL description VAL "The extra heavy rws supermag pellet stands out clearly from all other rws air gun pellets due to the heavier pellet weight.

COL description VAL "Chop onions, pepper, and more with this vegetable knife from Global. This knife is made from a single piece of high quality CROMOVA 18 stainless steel with a square tip and an ultra sharp blade. The ice tempered, convex edge can hold a sharper edge for a longer time so you can slice vegetables and make a delicious bowl of pasta primavera. It has an ergonomic handle with a dimple pattern making it comfortable and slip resistant, useful for repetitive slicing. The knifes perfect weight is achieved through the hollow handle that is filled with sand for ideal balance. This knife can be used in place of a Santoku knife so you can also cut meats and fruits. 5-1/2" L High tech from tip to handle, Global knives from Japan created a sensation when they burst onto the world's culinary stage as an alternative to traditional European-style cutlery. Blades are made of hard molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel and "face-ground" with a long taper rather than a short bevel so edges remain sharp longer than even the best high-carbon stainless-steel knives. Edges also are ground at a more acute angle than traditional European-style knives and arrive from the factory razor-sharp. Although Global also makes a "heavyweight" line for cooks who prefer hefty knives, its original knives--of which this 5-1/2-inch knife for precisely slicing and chopping vegetables is an example--have thinner blades and are lighter than traditional European-style knives. Global also dispensed with bolsters on its original knives to reduce weight. Balance is achieved by injecting a precise amount of sand for a particular blade style into a hollow handle. To ensure balance is continuous, the sand flows inside the handle as a blade is maneuvered. A finger notch between blade and handle provides safety. Stainless-steel handles are Global's most striking feature. They're molded to fit the hand and dimpled to resist slipping. Smaller around than many European-style handles, they're easy for small-handed cooks to grasp and seamless for sanitation. Global recommends using a ceramic sharpener or a diamond steel instead of a metal sharpening steel for its knives, supplemented by a synthetic whetstone, a ceramic whetstone, or a Shinkansen sharpener. Global also makes a Sharpening Guide Rail so blades can be honed on a whetstone at the proper angle. Global knives should be hand washed to protect edges. They carry a lifetime warranty against defects and breakage. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "Cut perfect portions of fish and potatoes to make fish and chips with this chef's utility knife from Global. This knife is made from a single piece of high quality CROMOVA 18 stainless steel that has been ice hardened so it will maintain a sharper edge for longer time.

The razor-sharp edge cuts with striking efficiency, resulting in a neatly sliced tomato, cheese slice, or lime. The blade is constructed of ice-tempered and hardened stainless steel, and its edge stays sharp far longer than similar blades while resisting rust, stains, and corrosion. Put a Global knife in your hand and you'll notice its lightweight comfort and delightful balance, which is especially handy when slicing multiple fruits or veggies for a large gathering.

COL description VAL "It's the ultimate brain game! Advanced Mastermind pits "code makers" against "code breakers." Code makers place five colored pegs behind a shield. Code breakers have twelve chances to figure out the color and sequence of the setup. If a dozen opportunities sounds overly generous, consider that code makers have 32,768 peg arrangements at their disposal. After code breakers make their first, best guess--by placing five pegs of their own on the game board, the code makers give some feedback. If one of the guesses is correct in both color and placement, they'll place a red peg in a "code peg" hole. A white peg indicates a correct color, but wrong placement. Code breakers won't know which of their guesses is correct, or even half-correct. It'll take concentration, mental fortitude, and a lucky guess or two to break the code.

COL description VAL "Satin Black Deluxe Tabletop Electric Grill, 1500-watt element and 200-square-inches of cooking surface. Energy efficient, even-cooking, and highly portable, Meco's Deluxe Tabletop Electric Grill features an innovative infrared heating element and 200-square-inches of space for cooking up savory hot meals on the fly. A 1500-watt element emits infrared heat to sear steaks and chicken to tender perfection. Easy-to-control infrared heat cooks evenly without burning. The grill's variable heat control feature enables instant temperature changes from a steak-searing high to a bread-warming low, so there's no waiting or preheating. Unlike charcoal grills that emit an unnatural smoke when juice drips on the coal, the infrared element burns off the dripping fats instantly, smoking food with untainted fumes for a natural, savory taste. Plus, with the Meco electric grill, there's no need for handling flammable lighter fluids or fuel cylinders. The heat reflector is positioned so that it drains excess dripping that might otherwise fuel large, meat-cauterizing flare-ups, though it also retains just enough juice to fuel flames small enough to lightly kiss the meat for a perfect sear. And, there's plenty of cooking space for large cuts of meat, such as, roasts, thick chops, whole chickens, and fancy burgers with all the trimmings. One more cool feature: A dual level mode simultaneously cooks steaks at different temperatures when one diner prefers his steak rare and the other prefers hers well-done. The dual-level mode also keeps bread warm on one side while chicken bakes on the other. Along with all these cooking options, Meco designed this electric grill for simple assembly, easy, economical use, and durability. First of all, the grill is made of high quality steel forms and tubing throughout. And, all components are coated with Meco's quality Dura Fuse powder finish for corrosion resistance and good looks. All critical electrical and mechanical components, including hinges and handles come pre-assembled, so there's no major project to face when the box comes. The tabletop and base attach easily with just a few nuts and bolts. Plus, this energy efficient grill costs half the price of gas grills to operate, and is six times cheaper than cooking with a charcoal grill! Best of all, the whole thing fits into most dishwashers for fast and easy cleaning. <i>--Brian Olson</i>"	COL description VAL "Electric Cart Grill with two folding, composite-wood side tables, shelf and rotisserie Electric BBQ Grill comes with more features.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

A good carving knife makes a tough job much easier, and this 8-inch model qualifies, as it expertly slices through any type of meat with ease. For many chefs, nothing beats the ergonomic comfort or classic styling of fully forged cutlery in "basic black." Mundial's 5100 Series Black is just that. The company's oldest line of fully forged knives, it exemplifies all the expertise that Mundial has acquired through its more than 70 years of crafting gourmet knives. 5100 Series Black is fully forged from high-carbon stainless steel and features a durable polyacetal handle in the traditional three-rivet style. <b> The Value of a Fully-Forged Knife </b><br> Mundial knives, with very few exceptions, are fully forged in a manufacturing process that combines innovative technology with old-world tradition and expertise. In the forging process, steel is heated to an extremely high temperature, set into a die, and hammered into the shape of the basic blade. Following a heating and cooling process, the forged blade is ground to create a full taper to the cutting edge. The result is a stronger, thicker, more resilient blade that flares smoothly at the heel to blend into the shape of the handle. Fully forged cutlery offers an array of key benefits, including greater tensile strength, increased durability, lasting sharpness, and better balance and control. <b>Construction</b><br> Mundial's computer-aided design creates the perfect shape and balance for chopping, dicing, and slicing all types of food. The knives are fully forged from high-carbon chrome molybdenum stainless steel for the best edge retention and sharpening ease. Each knife also undergoes Mundial's computerized blade grinding and polishing process to create a precise taper from tip to bolster (the quality bolster is the main feature of any truly forged knife). Busy chefs will appreciate the ergonomically crafted handles with full tangs, which deliver comfort, balance, and durability. Every Mundial knife is also hand sharpened and individually tested for ultimate performance. <b>Quality Control</b><br> How do Mundial knives compare to other premium cutlery?

Calcium hydroxide is used to prepare limewater (kalkwasser) solutions that will maintain calcium concentrations at natural seawater levels. Kalkwasser solutions maintain calcium directly and carbonate alkalinity indirectly. However, its capacity to perform these functions is dependent on evaporation rate and CO2 concentration. If the these two factors are insufficient you can provide additional calcium with Reef Advantage Calcium, Reef Complete, or Reef Calcium, and carbonate alkalinity with Reef Builder or Reef Carbonate (do not mix these directly with a kalkwasser solution). Avoid contact or breathing dust. Do not eat or get in eyes. In case of contact, flush area with water for 5-10 minutes. In case of eye contact, wash eyes with water immediately (5-10 minutes) and seek medical attention.

Never spend another cent on your litter box receptacles!! The custom-made BAG-it is a plastic retainer that's been precision cut for a perfect fit inside the standard LitterMaid receptacle (see the sample black BAG-it retainer in the photo - actual BAG-it is clear). How it works: Start with any bag that's wide enough (like the black plastic bag shown in the photo). Slip the bottom half of the bag into the inside of the BAG-it and wrap the top half of the bag around the outside of the BAG-it. Then push the bag with the BAG-it into the top of the receptacle - that's it!! The plastic bag is secured inside the receptacle and all the waste ends up IN THE BAG!! You can see videos of BAG-it and PERMA-lid on YouTube. When it comes time to remove the waste, grab the corner of the plastic bag and lift. As the bag and the BAG-it come out, tie up the ends of the bag and insert a new bag into the BAG-it. It takes less than a minute and costs you nothing if you keep some grocery bags around. No need to remove the LitterMaid receptacle - that stays in place and stays clean. **Note: Although the photo shows a black BAG-it inside a receptacle, we ship a CLEAR BAG-it; you supply the receptacle."	1

COL description VAL "Scientific Cookies are Scientific!  Cooking is a very analogue experience. A handfull of this, a pinch of that, blend until it's just so... there's no precision anywhere! That is, until you start baking! Baking is all about chemistry. Balance is key - balancing acids and bases, balancing structure and tenderness, balancing sweet and salty. In all things baking, you need a chemist's approach.  This is particularly true of cookies. You can use the protein in eggs for structure, and the fat in the yolks for a nice fatty mouthfeel. Sugar can also be used for structure and sweetness, but if you use powdered sugar, expect flatter thin chewy cookies. If you go with brown sugar, you may need to balance the added acidity with baking soda. And salt. Never ever forget the salt. Even in a sweet sugar cookie, forgetting salt leads to a bland cookie.  What you may not know is that shape lends more to the enjoyment of a good cookie than you think. Presentation helps you feel more satisfied when it's appealing. If you're a scientist, these shapes will draw you in immediately! Erlenmeyer flasks, test-tubes, beakers and the stylized electron-cloud atomic structure cookie cutters in this set make your cookies reflect the science with which they were made.

It will accommodate many puzzles up to 1,000 pieces - sizes up to 27.5 inches x 20.5 inches.  Some of the USA puzzle manufacturers make 1,000 piece puzzles larger than this so please check puzzle sizes carefully. A Jigstore stores up to 10 completed jigsaw puzzles.  The product preserves, protects and secures your made-up jigsaw puzzles keeping them snug and safe for evermore.  Jigstores make the perfect gift for puzzle enthusiasts who hate the idea of breaking-up their finished jigsaws. Each Jigstore comes complete with 10 rigid boards. When a puzzle is completed it is transferred to one of the boards for storage. Another board (holding a completed puzzle) can then be laid on top of the first one and in this way a "Multi-layer sandwich" is created of jigsaws and boards. The "Sandwich" is completed by putting a spare board on top of the last jigsaw and securing the whole together with the bands provided. A strong outer box ensures that each puzzle is kept safe within the store but each one can be taken out at any time and moved around independent of the others. Because Jigstore allows you to store and preserve your jigsaws in their made-up state it will transform them from boxes on a shelf to treasured collectibles.  Makes a great talking point as well as providing a cherished family heirloom."	0

COL description VAL "Mimic a natural morning sunrise and evening sunset every day. The Dual Ramp Timer is a fully programmable 24 hour LED lighting controller that not only turns your lights on and off, it also simulates gentle sunrise, sunset and moonlight for your critters. Designed for both freshwater and marine aquariums, it's extremely simple to use and slowly acclimates animals to the bright light that LEDs produce. Featuring two independent lighting channels, each channel can be programmed for on/off times, as well as minimum and maximum intensity/brightness. At each pre-programmed ion time, the Dual Ramp Timer slowly begins to mimic a morning sunrise by gently increasing the lighting level of each channel over 15 minutes. When the programmed off time is reached, it gradually dims the light over 15 minutes, ending at your minimum intensity setting - simulating a soft dusk to night. If you want some lunar lighting, simply set your blue channel to a low intensity and the moon will glow all night. By mimicking dawn and dusk, your animals are provided a soothing adjustment to full brightness and darkness, helping to prevent any sudden or stressful light shock. The next day, the schedule starts all over again, creating a natural circadian rhythm to the 24 hour light-dark cycle."	0

COL description VAL "The first one to get a full set of princess jewelry and the crown wins. Pretty Pretty Princess is an easy-to-play game for two to four children who like to dress up. Each player picks a colored piece in pink, green, blue, or purple and takes a turn spinning the wheel on the jewelry box to advance around the circular game board. Each space on the board guides the player to pick a piece of jewelry that matches the color of his or her playing piece, or to put one back in the jewelry box. The goal is to be decked out in full princess regalia. There is only one crown, and it can also be picked from the jewelry box or off the royal brow of some other would-be princess. Aspiring sovereigns should beware the black ring--you definitely don't want to be stuck with it at the end of the game. The game includes plastic bracelets, necklaces, rings, earrings, a crown, and a jewelry box with a spinner and a mirror. There are "jewel" stickers to decorate the jewelry box and the crown (but the stickers should not be put on skin or clothing). There's a charming simplicity in this game for little ones who dream of being a princess. Players move their pieces around the game board collecting plastic costume jewelry, such as rings, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets. The winner of the game is the one who collects the crown and all the jewels that match their playing color. That player is the princess who now turns over the spinner to reveal a mirror into which she can gaze at her royal self.

It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder? In addition to the Host Guide, eight player's books, and the tape, the package contains a map of the crime scene, secret clues, guest invitations, and nametags. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>"	COL description VAL "104024 Features: -Roman ruins. -Made in USA. -For 8 people.

COL description VAL "The monument and its history: The Serrano Towers formed part of the ambitious walled precinct that Pedro III the Ceremonious ordered to have built in 1356. Pere Balaguer was the master builder who directed the construction. Given its defensive nature, it is made of solid masonry reinforced with ashlar facing, in limestone from the quarries of Almaguer, Bellaguarda and Rocafort. It brings together all the elements of military engineering of the time, though its defensive nature is not present on the side that faces the inside of the city, the vaulted sections not having any protective covering. This unique aspect was completely in line with the wishes of the Authorities, thus preventing the possibility of garrison troops or invaders using the towers against the city itself. Currently surviving in the city are the Quart Towers, flanked by two towers of considerable height and of a similar defensive nature. The central wall section over the semicircular arch of the door is decorated with a fine tracery of florid Gothic style on which the coats of arms of the city and the kingdom stand out. The chambers of the lower floors are covered by Gothic groin vault and the upper chambers by sections of pointed barrel vault strengthened by ribs. A barbican or battlemented walkway links up the main body with both towers at the third floor level. There is no doubt that it currently constitutes one of the most representative monuments of Valencia, Spain."	0

COL description VAL "Yes, you can make delicious, lacey, delicate crepes and blintzes at home. This cast aluminum crepe pan makes it very much within the scope of the average home cook. Not only is making them easy, this pan's inverted design makes the process super speedy too. In fact, you need only cook the crepe on one side so there's no tricky flipping involved. You'll soon find crepes to be your answer to any meal, especially one that needs to be on the table fast. Sweet or savory, rolled, folded or stacked, crepes are incredibly versatile. This upside-down pan cooks crepes and blintzes quicker and easier than a traditional skillet. Its convex cooking surface looks like the pan's bottom, but it's actually the top. Dipping the pan into crepe batter coats it uniformly. Inverting the pan over a gas or electric burner quickly cooks a paper-thin crepe, and the pan's nonstick surface releases the crepe easily. (Recipes and instructions are included.) Made of heavy cast aluminum, the pan heats evenly and holds heat exceptionally well so there's no down time between crepes waiting for the pan to reheat. The pan's handle is made of hardwood to stay cool crepe after crepe. The pan carries a 20-year warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "This VillaWare crepe maker bakes versatile, paper thin, 7" crepes.

The 7-1/2-inch-diameter cooking surface is coated with nonstick material and is slightly convex. Dipping it into crepe batter coats it uniformly. Inverting the appliance and setting it on a counter (or dining table, for festive occasions) allows the crepe to cook, while the rubber feet protect the counter. The user then simply peels off the crepe. An automatic thermostat heats the cooking surface to the proper temperature, and a light signals when it's time to cook. The crepe maker, which features a stay-cool plastic handle, is accompanied by a plastic dishwasher-safe dipping plate to hold the batter.

Wusthof classic knives are precision forged from a single-piece of exceptional quality German steel alloy. The edges of these knives are razor sharp using our laser guided peptic sharpening technology. Our exceptional quality German steel alloy is featured in all our quality knives. Our unique steel alloy is specially tempered to be durable as well as allowing for extended edge retention. As a result, wusthof knives are not too hard and brittle and can easily be given an edge in your own kitchen. For nearly 200-year wusthof has been crafting fine cutlery in, "the cutlery capital of the world, " Solingen Germany. At wusthof we proudly etch the name of Solingen Germany right onto our knives. This is a privilege not granted to all knife manufactures as strict rules of origin apply. We treasure our nearly 200-year German tradition and are proud to represent the city of Solingen. Family owned and operated by the wusthof family since 1814. Tough polypropylene handles with full, visible tangs and the traditional three rivets distinguish Classic knives from W&uuml;sthof's other cutlery lines. Otherwise Classic knives are identical to other W&uuml;sthof knives, embodying all the virtues that have earned the German manufacturer world renown. The principal parts of a W&uuml;sthof knife--blade, bolster, and tang--are forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel, and the blade is precisely tapered from bolster to tip and from back to hand-honed edge. The blades and beautifully formed bolsters are not as thick as on some knives. As a result, despite their heft, strength, and durability, W&uuml;sthof knives are pleasingly delicate and marvelously balanced in action. This set equips a serious cook with nearly every cutting edge imaginable--there are 14 kitchen knives and eight 4-1/2-inch steak knives--plus a 10-inch sharpening steel to keep their edges aligned, tough kitchen shears, a 6-inch serving fork, and a 25-slot oak block to store everything on the counter within reach.

COL description VAL "The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Processor is the ideal kitchen assistant for your small food preparation tasks. The compact size fills minimum counter space but still boasts more power than other choppers, chopping and grinding up to 21 ounces at once using 2-Speed operation to tackle a range of ingredients. The Cuisinart Mini-Prep food processor stands 8 inches tall and just over 4 inches wide, but don't let the size fool you. The base houses a motor so powerful that you need to stabilize it with one hand while using the high setting to whip up a strawberry-banana smoothie in less than a minute. The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush for removing coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2 inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the dishwasher, but watch your fingers when disassembling the machine, as the blades are extremely sharp. <I>--Irene Svete </I> Editor's note: This is a reconditioned small appliance.

COL description VAL "Every year, the Japanese Hanami festival is celebrated when the cherry trees are in bloom. With the delicate blooms in full flower, people from every walk of life gather to pay tribute to the lovely array of color on display. The Sakura Small Ceramic Pet Cremation Urn honors a beloved part of the family with its soft forms and gentle curves, reminiscent of the Cherry Trees in bloom. These small pet urns for ashes are loving memorials to a cherished friend that shared in the joys and the trials, gave unconditionally and loved without ceasing. Often chosen as pet urns for small dogs or a pet urn for cats, the elegance of their design and the brilliance of their colors act as reminders of the precious time spent with a cherished member of the family. Ceramics are made by combining earthenware ingredients, such as clay and powders, with water and molding them into desired forms. Often covered in a waterproof glaze, ceramic pottery is constructed in differing ways. Most often thrown on a potters wheel, it can also be hand molded into varied shapes and then fired in a kiln, first to harden the clay into pottery, then to set the glaze and bring out its vibrant colors. Glazes, only after firing, become the spectacular hues seen on each finished product.<br><br> Artisans train for years to learn the techniques that successfully bring beautiful ceramic pieces into being. With its distinguished and long history, ceramic has enjoyed a development that has shaped it into the expertly crafted material used today. The techniques employed in its use are direct descendants of those invented thousands of years ago, and its evolution has given us the beauty and expert workmanship we see now. Ceramic urns for ashes and cremation pottery are particularly suited to house cremation ashes and are durable and beautiful memorials to a loved one. Often quite unique in their design, the choices available, both in aesthetic and price, are varied and suitable for any taste and budget."

They count on products that enable them to do their best-day in and day out-with speed, precision and ease. That is why chefs all around the world have made Mundial their top choice for professional-grade knives. Mundial Inc., headquartered in Walpole, MA, is the North American marketing, sales and distribution arm of Mundial S.A., whose corporate offices are located in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Mundial S.A. develops and manufactures over 95% of its own products including fully forged and stamped cutlery, sewing and craft scissors, manicure implements, metal fasteners and motors. The group and the Mundial trademark were established in Germany in 1931 by Paul Zivi. This noted metallurgist, along with his team of skilled engineers and designers, developed the most sophisticated techniques for designing and manufacturing high quality cutlery. This allegiance to quality has been maintained throughout the years for all of Mundial's products. Today, every Mundial product is produced under a rigorous quality control program that spans the entire manufacturing process from the development of the steel to the final polishing of the blade. Upon completion, every Mundial product is individually tested to ensure sharpness, precision and durability. As proof of its commitment to quality and customer satisfaction, Mundial stands behind its products, backing every one with a full Lifetime Guarantee against defects in materials, construction and workmanship. Mundial Inc. is currently among the leading North American brands of cutlery and kitchen accessories sold to the restaurant and institutional markets. It is also a leader in the retail and industrial scissors/shears categories. With a growing business in retail cutlery through gourmet, specialty and department stores, Mundial products are squarely positioned as high quality and upscale, but with a distinct value advantage. Thanks to manufacturing efficiencies and more competitive costs of raw materials (Brazil is one of the largest producers of steel in the world), Mundial can position its top quality products at extremely affordable retail prices. Mundial combines Old World craftsmanship with modern technology to produce a broad selection of products unmatched in the world for strength, durability, beauty, comfort and value. Mundial's 5600 Series of professional cutlery and cooking accessories is crafted from high-carbon stainless steel in order to combine the highest edge retention with easy resharpening. Each knife features an ergonomically designed handle that provides a secure non-slip grip even when wet. Mundial carefully matches each blade and handle so that they're perfectly balanced. A good grip and perfect balance minimize fatigue and make even large-scale food preparation fast, easy and precise. All 5600 Series knives are NSF approved, meeting all foodservice industry standards for sanitation. Mundial 5600 Series knives and accessories have Sanitized Antimicrobial Protection, which is the safe treatment of the polypropylene handles to guard against the growth of bacteria, yeast, mold and fungi. Mundial knives are also NSF approved, ensuring that they meet all foodservice industry standards for sanitation. But that is just the beginning, Mundial knives are also thoughtfully designed to simplify food preparation tasks, ensure comfort and minimize fatigue-even after a long and demanding day in the kitchen. Mundial begins by selection high-carbon stainless steel to combine the highest edge retention with easy resharpening. The company's computer-aided design process creates the perfect shape for each knife according to its function. Computerized grinding and polishing machines ensure precise tapering from tip to bolster. Finally, to deliver optimum performance, every Mundial knife is hand sharpened and individually tested. Mundial puts just as much thought and effort into the design and manufacture of its knife handles. Each is ergonomically designed and crafted to provide a secure non-slip grip even when wet. Mundial carefully matched each blade and handle so that they are perfectly balanced. A good grip and perfect balance minimize fatigue and make even large-scale food preparation fast, easy and precise. 5600 Series knives and accessories have Sanitized Antimicrobial Protection, which is the safe treatment of the polypropylene handles to guard against bacteria, yeast, mold and fungi growth. During the manufacturing process, Sanitized additives are incorporated directly into the knife handles, protecting them against microbial attack. The inclusion of these additives also decreases the risk of unpleasant odors while improving the hygiene of the knives. Sanitized Antimicrobial Protection is a highly respected and widely used technology all across the world. The process is continually tested in accordance with international standards. All test results support the safety, quality and effectiveness of products protected with Sanitized additives. While Sanitized Antimicrobial Protection adds an extra safeguard against bacterial growth in materials, thorough cleaning and maintenance is still required on all products treated with Sanitized additives. Mundial's 5600 Series knives are fully traceable. During the manufacturing process a unique tracking number is stamped on each blade, which enables the knives to be positively identified throughout their useful life. This tracking system facilitates quality assurance and quality monitoring while also providing controls for scheduled sterilization and resharpening. Useful life cycles can also be established, which facilitate re-ordering and minimize investment in inventory while maximizing productivity."	0

Contents: * Folding Game Board * One Die * 49 Polygon Tiles * Game Instructions * 50 Score Cards There's good news and bad news about this board game for two to four players. It's fun to play. It provides useful practice of addition and multiplication facts. It requires strategizing to decide how to play on each turn. That's the good news. The bad news is that the rules are rather difficult to figure out, even for an adult. But keep trying--it's a rewarding and educational game after all. Polygon uses numbered tiles that are placed on the game board in ways that achieve a score for each turn. You can play tiles in several ways so you have to add (and sometimes multiply, too) on each turn, as well as at the end of the game. Polygon is a subtle way to practice those math facts painlessly, so it's a good choice for elementary age kids from third through fifth grades. <I>--Marcie Bovetz</I>"	COL description VAL "Link-O Game"	1

Saute, poach, or braise in the S16G; it's also great for an after-school grilled cheese, Sunday pancakes, or pan-fried trout. Turned down to "warm," it even works as a chafing dish on a buffet table. Sensitive temperature control means a boil can reduce to a simmer in seconds, much like cooking over a gas burner. The dial reads in degrees like the dial of an oven; the 300-degree mark on the temperature control is equivalent to medium, a good heat for pan frying. A glass lid shows what's cooking without having to remove the lid. Both the interior and exterior of the pan are coated with a Dupont Teflon nonstick surface; to avoid scratching it, wooden and nylon utensils are best. The pan is fully immersible after removing the temperature control probe, so clean-up takes only a few quick swipes of a warm, soapy sponge. (Nylon scrubbers only; steel wool will scratch the nonstick finish). The cooking surface measures 16 by 12 inches; the actual dimensions of the appliance, including handles and legs, are 19-1/2 by 12 by 5-1/2 inches. Rival provides a limited warranty against defects in material and workmanship under normal use conditions. <i>--Garland Withers</i>"	0

COL description VAL "Haworthias are a genus of small succulent plants confined in the wild almost exclusively to the Republic of South Africa. The charm of Haworthias is in their small size, ease of growth, and the almost infinite variation of their delightful leaves. Haworthias rarely require a pot larger than 4-inches in diameter making them ideally suited for a bright windowsill. Perhaps the biggest problem you will encounter when growing Haworthias is that they tend to be addictive! If you acquire more than one plant, you may find yourself wanting more and more. Haworthias are very easy to grow. Remember that Haworthias are succulents, so they require abundant bright light. They also require a well drained soil that approaches dryness between watering. It is best to fertilize only sparingly, using a water soluble houseplant fertilizer diluted to 1/4 strength, no more often than monthly during active growth, and not all if the plant is resting. Normal house temperatures ar fine. The collection of 5 different Haworthias you will receive are growing in 3" pots. They are similar to the ones pictured. They are 3-4 inches tall."

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. <strong>About Horizon Fitness</strong><br> Horizon is part of Johnson Health Tech, one of the largest manufacturers of fitness equipment in the world.

Each Stamina X Versa-Bell 50 lb. adjustable dumbbell offers nine dumbbell weights in one, shattering the limitations that comes with a single-weight dumbbell. Specifically designed with your continual growth in mind, Stamina's innovative adjustable-weight dumbbell ranges from 10 to 50 pounds. Simple Weight Adjustments Perfect for your home, the Stamina X Versa-Bell dumbbell provides all the flexibility and benefits of nine separate dumbbells yet requires the space of just one, saving both space and money. Even better, the Versa-Bell is built for convenience and durability. The simple-adjust dial mechanism is made with rugged material and lets you switch among the nine weight settings in just a few seconds - eliminating the annoying interruptions needed to replace weights on the old style dumbbells. It's Called "Versa" for a Reason Not only is the weight of the dumbbell versatile, the exercises are limitless. Your core, upper and lower body can be targeted simultaneously or isolated depending on your routine - it's up to you. Consider just a few of the isolating exercises that Stamina personnel find especially effective: Dumbbell Bench Press - Strengthen your pectorals, triceps and deltoids (shoulders)<br> Alternated Biceps Curl - Target your biceps<br> Shoulder Press - Work your deltoids and triceps<br> Kneeling One Arm Row - Build your lats<br> Stationary Lunge - Do a complete lower-body workout, including the glutes, quadriceps, and calves<br> Calf Raises - Increase calf strength.<br> RECOMMENDED USE: Use at home or in workout areas with limited space. Replaces nine individual dumbbells. Do away with your space-consuming dumbbells and consolidate to a single pair with the Stamina Versa-Bell II adjustable dumbbells. Offering a series of weight settings from 10 to 50 pounds (in 5-pound increments), the Versa-Bell II units do the work of nine sets of dumbbells in one, so you don't need to dedicate more than a few feet of space to your workout area. Each innovative Versa-Bell II dumbbell is outfitted with a single 10-pound handle connected to a dial mechanism. As you move the dial, the handle latches on to a different combination of steel weight plates, with a window display showing which weight setting you've chosen. Dial it down to 20 pounds and you'll lift only a single set of plates, but dial it up to 50 pounds and you'll get the whole combination. It's the easiest way possible to save space and money without sacrificing quality. Each dumbbell includes a durable, heavy-duty nylon weight tray."	0

It comes with bare roots that should be planted under the substrate. The Anubias Barteri plant is a very popular plant in the aquarium hobby due to its visual appeal and how easy it is to care for. This plant will grow in just about any type of lighting, but its leaves grow more quickly and densely under high-intensity lighting. Anubias Barteri can tolerate just about any type of water hardness and pH levels; however, it tends to do best in soft water with a pH of 6.5 to 7.5. The best temperature range for this plant is 72-82 F. The leaves of this plant are large, pointed at the ends, and leathery in texture. Because its leaves are tough, they are usually not eaten by fish or other plant-eating critters."

When it comes to our dog beds, we dont cut corners. Every single one of our products is made from only the highest-quality materials to ensure that your dog bed will last for years. Constructed of our own proprietary Ripstop ballistic material, our Tough series dog beds are the most chew-proof cushion beds available. These densely woven covers will resist tearing and scratching, and the Ripstop pattern of fibers prevents small holes from growing in size. A powerful, industrial-strength Velcro closure on the bottom keeps the mattress tightly sealed and protected. The smooth, canvas-like texture of the bed allows dirt, fur, and liquids to slide right off, making cleanup a breeze. Most spills and messes can be simply wiped up, but the removable cover can be machine-washed if needed. The nesting fills use premium CertiPUR-US shredded foam to create a dense, flexible cushion for your dog to nestle down into. Experienced dog owners know that theres nothing out there short of hard metal thats truly chew-proof; dogs have been known to chew through Kevlar, sheetrock, and chain-link fencing, to name a few, but when it comes to a soft, pillow-style bed, our Tough beds really are the strongest on the market. The Round Tough Bed has a Chew Proof Rating of 4 out of 5, meaning that it will stand up to 90% of chewers and works best for light or moderate chewers. Its an especially great choice for dogs that normally gravitate towards corners. For a heavy or persistent chewer, however, only our Ballistic Chew Proof Cot will do. If you do have a dog that manages to damage this bed within the first 90 days of purchase, well replace the cover once free of charge as per our Chew Proof Warranty."	0

Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. "Once upon a time, King Kandy, the Imperial Head Bonbon and Grand Jujube of Candy Land disappeared." Thus begins the magical journey of Milton Bradley's classic Candy Land board game. Captivated by the story of a kidnapped king and eager to help find him, little ones move their gingerbread pawns along a rainbow path and through a land of candy characters, all subjects of King Kandy's realm. <P> Playing cards thoughtfully designed for non-readers are coded with colorful squares matching the jeweled stepping-stone path or an occasional token matching one of the characters' symbols: draw a blue card, move to the nearest blue stepping-stone; draw a snowflake and earn a visit to Queen Frostine's iceberg. There are occasional pitfalls, too: land on the wrong square and you might be stuck in Molasses Swamp until a red card is drawn. With all these enticing, sugarcoated images (and King Kandy plainly visible at path's end), children can't help but be delighted by Candy Land. It's delicious!

COL description VAL "<div class="aplus"> <h4>J.K. Adams: A 2nd-Generation, Family-Owned Company</h4> Kitchen storage solutions by J.K. Adams make it easy to save on valuable kitchen space while enjoying the best of USA-made craftsmanship. The family-owned company provides everything from pot hooks and spice bottles to wooden spice carousels, kitchen-knife blocks, bread boxes, wine racks, pot racks, and more. J.K. Adams' wooden kitchen items feature renewable and sustainable wood in Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Alder, Ash, or Hickory varieties. A thoughtful choice for gift giving, the high-quality kitchen items provide sleek designs and convenient functionality for year after year of everyday convenience. In the late-1970's, when the gourmet-chef-tools market in the U.S. was still in its infancy, J.K. Adams owner Malcolm Cooper, Sr. conceived of the first slanted knife block. His goal was to create a cutlery organizer that would hold knives at a low enough angle that they could be easily removed from the block when it was pushed back under a cabinet overhang. The J.K. Adams Kangaroo knife block was launched in 1980--the first-ever slanted knife block, and still the best. Recognizing the many opportunities to improve kitchen storage, J.K. Adams introduced the revolving "carousel" spice rack in 1982 followed by countless other well-designed storage products in the years since, including the popular in-drawer knife tray in 1994, a space-saving alternative to the knife block that offers the same safety and blade protection. In 2011, J.K. Adams takes cutlery storage to a new level once again with the new Universal knife block. For over 30 years, J.K. Adams has continued to lead and inspire the kitchen storage market with their innovative designs, superior hardwoods, and exemplary craftsmanship. Some of the world's finest woodworkers can be found in New England. The rich heritage and folklore of the great Yankee Woodworker is as well known today as it was hundreds of years ago, and the craft has been handed down through the generations. J.K. Adams' success is certainly attributable to the early Vermonters employed by the company while in its infancy who brought forth the techniques and quality craftsmanship that could only come from generations of shared knowledge and experience. The J.K. Adams factory has been at the same location since the beginning. As many as three generations of families have relied on J.K. Adams to provide for their families. Located in a rural area of Vermont, J.K. Adams remains one of the largest employers in the area and is an important pillar of support for the local community. J.K. Adams has always used the creativity and skill of their workforce in developing new products, and today J.K. Adams continues its New England craftsmanship with a wide variety of cutting boards, as well as wooden salad bowls, kitchen islands, and slate serving trays. And at the J.K. Adams factory, you'll find future generations of woodworkers building upon the traditions begun over 65 years ago. Cutting boards and other products by J.K Adams are made in the North America. In colonial New England, three strokes of a broad ax were used to mark the finest trees in the forest for the Queens' Navy shipmasts. The broad arrow was adopted as our logo because it symbolizes the exceptional quality of wood that goes into our products. Wood is naturally anti-bacterial, and any bacteria left on the board will actually lessen in time versus multiplying on a plastic cutting board. A wooden board will also be more gentle on your knife's edge, and it just feels and sounds better under a knife. Wash by hand in warm soapy water and dry thoroughly, and oil frequently with mineral oil to help give it an optimal appearance. Do not soak, microwave, freeze, or put in the dishwasher. For removing stains, you can use a weak bleach-and-water solution or a combination of lemon juice and salt. Be sure to rinse and wipe with mineral oil afterward. Additionally, the surface can be sanded to make the board look like new--although a board with wear will add character to your kitchen. For storage, keep the board away from strong sunlight as avoiding UV rays will reduce the risk of fading."	COL description VAL "Global 4-Piece Steak Knife Set in holder (G-88/4001)"	0

Fortunately, this versatile grill is a space saver, cooking something for every meal: restaurant-style Belgian waffles, paninis, sausages, or grilled meats and fish. The secret is the reversible grid. One side is a four-square waffle iron for waffles, while the other neatly grills sandwiches or paninis. To grill sausages, bacon, salmon, vegetables, or pancakes, just open the grill so both sides lay flat. The nonstick grids prevent crumbling waffles, are easy to clean, and allow for lower-fat grilling, justifying more whipped cream on your waffles, or extra cheese in your sandwich.

COL description VAL "Broan Standard Economy Series fans are versatile, compact, and economical ventilation solutions. <div class="aplus" ><div class="two-third-col"> The Broan 671 bathroom ventilation fan features a durable 50 CFM blower wheel for consistent performance in any bathroom of your home. The fan operates at only 6.0 sones. Offering either wall or ceiling installation, its compact polymer housing fits easily between ceiling joists or wall studs. Double-strength steel mounting flanges have keyhole slots for easy installation, and torsion spring grille mounting means that no tools are necessary. Homes are now built much more efficiently than they once were, making them far less costly to heat and air condition. That said, having proper ventilation throughout the home is now imperative in order to provide a safe and comfortable living environment. Broan ventilation fans provide the best solutions to ensure that contaminants are constantly removed from the indoors. Eliminating excess moisture keeps your home dry and comfortable and can help avoid mold and mildew. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) "outgas" from construction materials such as plywood, carpet, fabric, paint, adhesive, insulation, and other common items. Allergens, dust, cooking vapor, and what the kids bring home from school are more reasons why good ventilation is critical. A sone is a measurement of sound in terms of comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the environment. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is "sensed." One sone is half as loud as two sones, and is equivalent to a quiet refrigerator. Air movement is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). To determine CFM requirements, first determine the size of your room. Measure and multiply the length, width and ceiling height of your room to determine cubic footage. Then use the multiplication factor of .13 and round up to the next "ten." Here are three examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> Bathroom with 8' ceiling: 7' wide x 9' long x 8' high x .13 = 66. Select a bath fan with at least 70 CFM. <strong>Example 2:</strong> Bathroom with 9' ceiling: 10' wide x 9' long x 9' high x .13 = 105. Select a bath fan with at least 110 CFM. <strong>Example 3:</strong> For a bathroom with a vaulted ceiling, use the average ceiling height at the wall and the peak: 8' wide x 12' long x ((8' at wall + 12' at peak) / 2 = 10') average height x .13 = 125. Select a fan (or fans) with at least 130 CFM. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. Today, Broan-NuTone leads the industry with forward-thinking residential ventilation products, customized climate, communications and storage solutions and superior customer service. The Broan brand focuses on range hoods, ventilation fans, heater/fan/light combination units, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) fresh air systems, built-in heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators and trash compactors, while the NuTone brand offers door chimes, central vacuum systems, stereo intercom systems, medicine cabinets, ironing centers, ceiling fans and ventilation fans."

Fan housing dimensions is 8.68 x 9.125 x 4.75 in inches What makes the Air King high performance bath fan series unique is the UL listed molded high impact plastic housing that provides multiple benefits. "Traditional" bath fan housings are fabricated from steel which involves bending and welding. This is a more expensive process and over the life of the fan welds can break, causing the fan to operate much louder or even with a rattling sound. Metal housings reverberate and echo noise. Because the Air King high performance bath fan series is in an all plastic housing, there are no welds to break and the plastic is a natural sound absorbent material. If you live anywhere near salt water, or the unit will be used in high moisture areas, this fan is an almost must. The UL listed molded high impact plastic housing will not rust, giving the unit a longer life. The high performance exhaust fan series features a unique snap-in installation system. The 4-Inch plastic duct collar with back draft damper insures quiet operation and prevents drafts from entering the room. Exhaust capacity for rooms of approximately 90 to 115 square feet.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

Testing water parameters weekly helps prevent invisible water problems that can be harmful to fish. pH is the measure of acidity of water, on a scale ranging from 0 to 14. A pH of 0 is the most acidic, while a pH of 14 is the most alkaline. Different geographies have different tap water conditions with different pH levels, while fish require a specific pH level to thrive. A pH of 7.0 is ideal when keeping a community aquarium containing a variety of tropical fish. Goldfish and livebearers prefer a pH of 7.5. Many Amazonian fish, like angelfish and neon tetras, prefer a pH of 6.5 to 6.8. Mollies and swordtails thrive at pH 7.2 to 7.5. API pH TEST KIT for freshwater aquariums test a wide range of pH levels from 6.0 to 9.0.

COL description VAL "Most water problems are invisible to the eye. Quickly measure and modify the six aquarium levels that are most important to the health of your freshwater fish with the API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT. To stay healthy and thrive, fish need properly balanced levels of ammonia, pH, high range pH, nitrite and nitrate. These levels can change rapidly and create harmful conditions when fish waste, uneaten food or other organic matter accumulate, or when untreated water is added. If left uncorrected, all of these can be harmful or even fatal to fish, with consequences such as reduction of oxygen, increase in stress and higher risk of disease. The API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT measures these six parameters with scientific accuracy and provides professional results. It comes with four glass test tubes, a holding tray, test tube rack and computer calibrated, laminated color card. Just fill the test tubes, add the test drops and compare results to the color card.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

COL description VAL "In May of 1944 the USAF cancelled its B-35 programme, foreseeing the inadequacy of this bomber in the future. At the same time, however, it authorized the completion of two of these to be modified and fit with jet propulsion engines. The first YB-49 took flight on October 21, 1947 powered by eight Allison J35 turbojets, which, in the end, were not very reliable. The many problems notwithstanding, the YB-49 did show promise, with the exception of its autonomy factor, reduced due to the high fuel consumption of that generations engines. One of its great advantages was something that in those days was not considered very important: the fact that the YB-49 often disappeared from the radar screens because of its weak marking. The problem which eventually signed the fate of this promising aircraft was the excessively thick airfoil section which limited its cruising speed, just when this factor seemed to be the most important quality needed for a combat airplane."

Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary."

The Four Star II line contains knives for all tasks, including the following open stock knife types: parer, bread, boning knife, Kudamono parer, sandwich, fillet, carver, chef&#146;s, slicer, santoku, and others. Twin Four Star II knives are also available in a range of block sets and gift sets, to be sure that your cutlery needs are covered. <td> </tr> </table> <P> <B>A New Standard in Knife Construction</B><P> Twin Four Star II knives are precision forged from a single piece of exclusive-formula, high-carbon, no-stain steel under the all-new Sigmaforge standard. As a result, Twin Four Star II knives have improved quality consistency, lasting sharpness, and perfect geometry. Sigmaforge one-piece construction also provides high precision and improved stability of the blade and steel structure, thus improving cutting-edge retention for lasting sharpness. In addition, Twin Four Star II knives use J.A. Henckels's Friodur ice hardening for corrosion resistance, a process that also contributes to cutting-edge retention. <P> <center> <img src=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar-sigma.jpg align="center"></center> <p clear=left> <B>An Enhanced Handle for Easier Use</B><P> <table><table border="0" cellpadding="8"> <tr><td><img src= https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/cutlery/hen-fourstar-hand-back.jpg </td> <td> Twin Four Star II knives have an enhanced handle design that features a stainless-steel end cap with the famous Zwilling J.A.

COL description VAL "Race your pawns around the gameboard from start to home. Capture opponents, from blockades and do a little artful dodging to escape. For 2-4 players. Ages 7-adult. Parcheesi, a family classic since the 1860s, is the ultimate race-and-chase board game. The object is take four pawns from start to home, using rolls of the dice to dictate your moves. It sounds easy, but to accomplish your mission you have to first roll a five to even move off of start, and then you must avoid running into blockades and dodge your opponents, who threaten at every turn to send you back to the beginning. If you plot your moves strategically and use the safety zones scattered around the board, you might just make it. Parcheesi comes with a game board, 16 wooden pawns in four colors, two dice, and a dice cup that's a little too small to be truly useful. Parcheesi is for two to four players."

COL description VAL "The McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet was a result of the United States Navy's (USN) Naval Fighter Attack Experimental program to procure a multirole aircraft to replace the F-4 Phantom II, A-4 Skyhawk and A-7 Corsair II, and to complement the F-14 Tomcat. Secretary of the Navy W. Graham Claytor, Jr. gave the name Hornet on March 1, 1977. The F/A-18 is a twin-engine, multi-mission fighter/attack aircraft that can operate from either aircraft carriers or land bases. It was designed to attack both ground and aerial targets. Developed in the 1970s for service with the Navy and the US Marine Corps, it is also used by the air forces of several other nations. The Hornet fills a vast spectrum of roles, including fleet air defense, interdiction, air superiority, suppression of enemy air defenses, close and deep air support, reconnaissance, forward air control, fighter escort, and day and night strike missions. In addition, it is the aerial demonstration aircraft of the USN's Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels. Formed in 1946, the Blue Angels are the world's first officially sanctioned military aerial demonstration team. The group has been using the Hornet since they completed their 40th anniversary year and unveiled the sleek aircraft on November 8, 1986. The power and aerodynamics of the Hornet allows them to perform a slow high angle of attack tail sitting maneuver, and to fly a loop with landing gear down in formation, neither of which has been duplicated by the Thunderbirds of the Air Force. The Blue Angels perform more than 70 shows at 34 locations throughout the United States each year, where they still employ many of the same practices and techniques in their aerial displays as in 1946. Since their inception, they have flown for more than 427 million spectators worldwide.

COL description VAL "AquaBella Bioenzyme water treatment is a revolutionary product that maintains the clarity and health of your aquatic environment for one year. What makes AquaBella so effective and different from other microbial products? While others break down ammonia to nitrates (one step in the nitrification process), AquaBella carries the process through to completion, converting nitrites to nitrates and nitrates to dinitrogen gas that is released into the atmosphere. This fully cleanses the environment, as opposed to simply recycling ammonia and nitrates back through the water. AquaBella also has a higher percentage of anaerobic microbes than other products, promoting biological activity in the tank bottom as well as near the surface. This feature helps keep gravel clean of organic residues. For best results, clean/change filters and change water before AquaBella is applied. Tap water must be de-chlorinated before AquaBella is applied."	COL description VAL "Unique self-adjusting design for an easy installation with no cutting required.

The E55 is equipped with a heavy 27-pound flywheel, a high gear ratio not found on most comparable models, and a whisper-quiet drive system. As a result, the trainer delivers an extremely fluid performance and plenty of top-end resistance, helping it function like a much more expensive trainer. The E55's power incline feature, meanwhile, boosts resistance even more while targeting different core muscle groups, adding diversity to your workout. Simply press a button to raise the incline ramp to your preferred position. The ramp angle is fully adjustable from a level plane up to 40 degrees, so you can individually target and work all major lower body muscles. The E55 makes it easy to track your workout progress via the vibrant 7.5-inch blue LCD display, which includes windows for resistance, incline, time, distance, calories burned, pulse, and pace. The console also offers a number of handy amenities, including built-in speakers for listening to your iPod or MP3 player, built-in cooling fans, and a water bottle holder. The E55 comes complete with two heart-rate-controlled workout options, so you can customize the workout specifically to your needs. Throughout your HR workout, the elliptical will display a heart rate zone graph on the console while adjusting the resistance to keep you in your target zone (the trainer includes a wireless chest strap that touts a 99.9 percent accuracy rating). <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="298"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/sole-e55-right-collage.jpg" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The E55 offers an adjustable pedals so that you can angle the pedal from heel-to-toe for a comfortable feel.</strong></em></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>The remainder of the time, you can challenge yourself with the six automatic programs or two customizable programs. To encourage a more comfortable workout, Sole added oversized, custom-designed foot pedals to the E55. Designed in collaboration with a leading physical therapist and sports enthusiast, the pedals feature a 2-degree inward slope, helping reduce the ankle and knee stress that's common in other elliptical machines. This collaboration also produced a revolutionary foot pedal adjustment system not found on any other elliptical brand. Sole knows that not everyone walks the same way, so the company's engineers designed the E55 to adjust to your gait via a dial mechanism. This allows you to set the pedal angle from heel to toe, with 10 total choices. The feature also reduces the numb toe effects and sore Achilles tendons common on other elliptical machines. Additional features include a pair of stationary handlebars with built-in pulse sensors; adjustable incline and resistance controls built into the arms; and 20 resistance levels. <strong>Specifications:</strong> <b>Manufacturer's Warranty</b><br> Lifetime on frame; 5 years on parts and electronics; 2 years on labor <b>About Sole Elliptical Trainers</b><br> The perfect elliptical trainer should <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="207"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/sole-ellips.jpg" /><br /><br /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>combine both natural human movement and exercise effectively to simulate the suitable pattern your foot travels during a smooth, continuous, elliptical motion that is comfortable the entire time.

COL description VAL "ACTION FIGURES"	COL description VAL "From the Manufacturer "Othello is a game where not all is Black and White. The lead can change hands from play to play and strategy is everything. Play is simple. Players are represented by either Black or White discs on the board. On each turn, players flank the discs of the opposing player between two of their own. Once captured, the double-sided discs are turned over and become the opposite color. If you have a move, you have to take it whether you want to or not. Thats all, thats the entire game. But more and more discs fall to the opposing side with each turn. Where will it all end? Starting from just four discs to begin the game, play moves all over the board with as many as 64 discs placed by the final move. Play can end when one player cant make any more moves OR when the board is full. To add to the fun, if you can make a move but youre out of discs, your opponent has to give you one of theirs. Thats like arming the enemy! As you become more and more familiar with Othello, certain strategies will begin to emerge. Owning a corner is always an advantage as that protects your discs in the immediate vicinity - your opponent cant outflank you. But is your opponent backing you towards a corner so they can try to control it themselves? Thats the strategy of Othello. Can you see enough moves ahead to make your opponent put a disc somewhere they dont want to? A minute to learna lifetime to master!""	0
COL description VAL "Middle-Earth Quest is set in the seventeen-year period between Bilbo's birthday party and the Ring's departure from the Shire, as described in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings. One player takes the role of Sauron, who is attempting to dominate Middle-earth with his nefarious plots and evil minions. Up to three other players take the roles of heroes who must hold the darkness at bay until Gandalf's plans have matured. To do so, the heroes must embark on dangerous quests and consult with the famous characters of Middle-earth to gain favor and knowledge. Will you play as Sauron and claim Middle-earth as your own? Or will you play as a hero and stand against the Dark Lord? The fate of Middle-earth rests in your hands! It is time of growing darkness and despair. Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord of Mordor, has returned to his ancient fastness of Barad-dur. From there, his evil and corruption has spread across the lands once more. Alas, in the West, there is little strength left. The Elves have all but abandoned Middle-earth, and the blood of Numenor has run thin; that which remains now dwells in Minas Tirith, or with the lonely rangers that haunt the ruins and wild country of Arnor.Yet, there is still hope. Gandalf the Grey has learned that the One Ring, the master-ring which Sauron desires and fears above all, is with the hobbit Frodo in the Shire. And there are heroes! Heroes to aid Gandalf in his hunt for the creature Gollum, and in his quest for the lost knowledge of Isildur's Bane. Heroes, whose strong arms guard the Shire from the enemy. Heroes, who venture into the forests of Ithilien, or even into the Land of Shadow itself, there to disrupt the schemes of Sauron, wherever they may be found.Middle-earth Quest is set in the seventeen-year period between Bilbo's birthday party and the Ring's departure from the Shire, as described in J.R.R.

The Little Buddy is backed by a limited lifetime warranty. <strong>About Planet Bike</strong><br> In November of 1996, Planet Bike was founded in Madison, Wisconsin. In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists.

In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact. Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists. "	1

Fabricated from high-quality stainless steel, these lightweight knives offer single-piece, precision-stamped blade construction for long-lasting durability. Enjoy tireless cutting with the traditional triple-rivet handle, deftly designed for comfort and balance. Henckels International makes essential kitchen tools every home chef needs. From steak knives to spatulas, each product boasts high quality at an exceptional value. Created in 1895 by Zwilling J.A. Henckels, this value-driven brand guarantees the same durability, design and ease of use for which the global company is known. Equip your kitchen with expertise with Henckels International. Designed to peel and slice just about anything, this 3-inch pointed paring knife benefits from J.A. Henckels's 260 years in the cutlery business. It's made from high-grade, rolled stainless steel, produced using Henckels's own Sintermetal Component Technology. This process allows different grades of steel to be combined to form a single integral piece capable of withstanding extreme stress--each part of the knife is made from the grade of steel with the optimum characteristics for that component. The cutting edge features a specially designed serration pattern, ensuring prolonged sharpness without resharpening. The full-length tang (meaning the metal continues all the way through to the end of the handle) gives you a better-balanced and stronger knife. The polypropylene handle with rustproof rivets is nearly indestructible. It's dishwasher-safe, but be careful that the blade doesn't touch other objects; hand washing is recommended to keep steel blades scratch free. <I>--Doree Armstrong</I>"	COL description VAL "J.A.

Our princess is a sturdy little girl in the castle who needs to be rescued from a mean guard and fierce dog. It's not going to be easy and besides, darkness is coming! Off we go through fields, woods, mountains and villages in search of things magical and practical needed to free the Princess. We'll do some sharing, help each other to remember where special things are hidden, and together think our way past the obstacles.

Players help each other climb a mountain, make a community, complete a space exploration... They never play against each other. After all, the initial impulse to play a game is social; that is, we bring out a game because we want to do something together.

We hope you enjoy playing and learning together! Players work together to rescue the damsel in distress in the Princess Game. As players move their pieces around the board, they uncover tools such as a boat, key, or magic potion. These are used to get past six obstacles that guard the princess: a moat, a guard dog, a sentry, a locked door, a dark tunnel, and a magic spell. It's a race against time, because in addition to objects, the board contains spaces that advance the coming of the night and the end of the game. Cooperation comes into play when players help each other come up with creative uses for the various objects. The horse, for example, might be used to swim the moat or run past the dog, or might be traded to the guard as a bribe. Since all players are working toward a common goal, everyone wins or loses as a team."	COL description VAL "A mystery game! Valuables have been stolen, and we have to find them before midnight.

Place a 2-to-3-inch layer of mulch around the base of the plant once it has sprouted to retain moisture around the plant's roots and prevent weeds. Provide a trellis support and train the bitter melon vines towards it. This will keep the vines and fruit up off the ground, protecting them from pests and rotting.

These knives are one-piece, hot-drop hammer forged from a single billet of the finest German stainless steel alloy and fitted with the most durable industrial strength, ergonomic handle in the world. Meridian Elit knives are handcrafted and polished one at a time using the same techniques that have been the hallmark of fine Solingen-made cutlery that have stood the test of time. Meridian Elit knives are the authentically superior, forged and triple-riveted knives manufactured in Solingen, Germany.Crafted from 3rd generation craftsmen in the historical cutlery city of Solingen, Germany.The Messermeister Meridian Elit 8" Carving Knife, has a narrow spear-point, fine-edge blade that is used for small to medium carving chores. It separates meat from the bone and slices it into thin serving portions. This knife's narrow, thin blade makes any carving job a breeze. The 8-inch blade, long enough for most slicing tasks, neatly carves slices--thick or thin--from roast beef, ham, and turkey. One of Messermeister's top-of-the-line Elite knives, which are distinguished from the company's first-rate San Moritz knives by a three-step hand sharpening process blades undergo and classic three-rivet, full-tang, seamless polymer handles, the knife is forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel. The blade has a shortened bolster so it's sharp from tip to heel and a cook's forefinger rests comfortably on it. Made in Germany, the knife comes in a padded gift box. To keep the blade sharp, it's best to hand wash this knife in soapy water. <I>--Fred Brack</I>"	COL description VAL "The Messermeister Carving Set consists of an 10-inch Kullenschliff Slicing Knife (E/3688-10K) and a 7-inch Straight Carving Fork (8012-7)."	1

Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary. This 9-1/4-inch square baker, crafted from commercial-grade  stoneware with Le Creuset's poterie glaze, cooks up a mean hot dish and  looks good doing it. Coated inside and out with the company's signature  enamel, the dish doesn't absorb moisture and resists chips, nicks,  stains, and odors. It's oven-safe to 500 degrees F and can also go in  the freezer, refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. It even looks  good at the table. The easy-grip side handles--ridged above and lipped  underneath--provide room enough for oven-mitt-sized fingers. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>"	COL description VAL "Le Creuset Square 9 inch dish with free 5 inch small square dish is perfect for a variety of recipes."	1

Cranium The Family Fun Game is great for ages 8 to Adults, up to 4 players, and last for about 40 fun filled minutes."	COL description VAL "Make the whole family just a little bit smarter with this fun grey matter game! The original highly successful Cranium game is a great way for adults and older children to face off in entertaining challenges. Later games using a similar model were greatly simplified and geared more toward younger players. But with this new family model, everyone can play together. It still employs the same four basic Cranium categories: Creative Cat, Data Head, Star Performer, and Word Worm but within those groupings there are numerous new challenges for players of all ages. Like the traditional game, there is squishable clay for sculpture challenges but now there are also stacking cubes and a set of plastic frogs that players are occasionally called upon to flip. The game board is scaled back a bit, offering a short length of the game. We found the questions and pacing to be brisk and while younger players (age 8 and over, kids younger than that would be fine playing with an older teammate) would be able to have fun, its one of those rare family games that adults can actually enjoy playing. <i>--Charlie Williams</i>"	1

Comes with enough 100% rainbow pure wool for two child-sized scarves and two 8" Wooden stick shuttles. Also includes two books: an illustrated instruction booklet and the easy Weaver book of project ideas to make it easy to learn how to use and craft beautiful scarves. Measures 17.5" X 10" X 5.5", for ages 7 and up. Harrisville Design's Easy Weaver Hardwood Weaving Loom is a surprisingly fun, educational, and practical gift for any kid who has--or could stand to develop--a little patience. The premade warp takes care of the most tedious aspect of weaving, though the 36-page instruction booklet does come with directions for making new warps. The set also includes two stick shuttles and enough purple and mauve yarn to weave a 6-by-36-inch piece of fabric. Eager weavers can get started right away with this easy-to-use set, but it's a good idea for kids to spend some time with the guidebook beforehand to practice the more complex tasks. Scarves, place mats, blankets, and more can be fashioned with the kit, though many projects require some sewing to finish.

Perfect for training, anti-pulling or just as an everyday collar, the Rio offers a more humane alternative to choke and prong collars. Made of 100% genuine Argentinean harness leather and soft cowhide padded leather on the bottom. Available for small to XL breeds. Sizes range from 10"&nbsp;to 24", in four stunning shades.<br>HOW TO MEASURE<br>To properly measure your dog for a Rio Martingale collar, please read and follow these steps: * The "Fully Tightened" measurements in the chart below refers to the length of the leather straps touching (not including the rings)* The "Fully Extended" measurements in the chart below refers to the maximum circumference when the collar and chain are completely opened.* The 2 steel rings on either ends of the collar add an additional 1"-2" to the overall length of the collar (depending on the size of the collar as the rings vary in size accordingly). For example, a 14" Rio collar referes to the length of the leather strap, not including the rings. Measure the middle of your dog's neck, or slightly higher up on the neck, depending on how you intend to use the collar.* If you want the collar to pinch when the dog pulls, choose between 1.5 -2 sizes smaller than your dog's actual neck size. For example, if your dog's neck measure 16.5", and you want to use the collar to pinch the neck when the dog is pulling, your perfect size would be a 14" Rio Martingal collar. * If you do not want the collar to pinch when the dog pulls and simply want the collar to close cofmortably snug around the neck, choose 1 size down from the actual neck size. For example, if your dog's neck measures 18", choose the 16" Rio collar. The 2 rings on either end will give you an additional 1.5"- 2" length."

COL description VAL "Enjoy an efficient full-body workout without heading to the gym with the Sole E95 elliptical trainer. Boasting a heavy 30-pound flywheel, a high gear ratio not found on most comparable models, and a pair of upper body handles, the E95 delivers an extremely smooth workout with plenty of top-end resistance. Users will also appreciate the unique oversize foot pedals, which were designed in collaboration with a leading physical therapist and sports enthusiast. The pedals are not only extra large, but also feature a 2-degree inward slope that reduces the ankle and knee stress that's common in other elliptical machines. The collaboration also produced a revolutionary foot pedal angle adjustment not found on any other elliptical. Taking into account that not everyone walks the same way, Sole engineers made the E95's pedals adjustable to fit the way you walk. This also reduces the likelihood of numb toes and sore Achilles tendons. Workout specifics include 20 resistance levels, 10 total programs (including two custom and two heart-rate programs), and a 20-inch stride length. Perhaps the handiest feature from a user perspective, however, is the easy-to-use electronic console, which integrates a red/green display, a cooling fan, and a water bottle holder. Additional features include stationary handlebars with built-in pulse sensors for monitoring your heart rate; a heart rate chest strap for hands-free pulse monitoring; heavy-duty rails with smooth-riding wheels on the back; and a rear plastic shroud that adds additional stability for aggressive use.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

This adorable version of the classic Candy Land game features gingerbread men as movers, colored cards, and fun illustrations that kids love, with different destinations like Cookie Commons and the chunky Chocolate Mountain. Players choose their cards, move their pawns, and let their imaginations soar as they make their way to the castle to win! For 2 to 4 players. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. "Once upon a time, King Kandy, the Imperial Head Bonbon and Grand Jujube of Candy Land disappeared." Thus begins the magical journey of Milton Bradley's classic Candy Land board game. Captivated by the story of a kidnapped king and eager to help find him, little ones move their gingerbread pawns along a rainbow path and through a land of candy characters, all subjects of King Kandy's realm. <P> Playing cards thoughtfully designed for non-readers are coded with colorful squares matching the jeweled stepping-stone path or an occasional token matching one of the characters' symbols: draw a blue card, move to the nearest blue stepping-stone; draw a snowflake and earn a visit to Queen Frostine's iceberg. There are occasional pitfalls, too: land on the wrong square and you might be stuck in Molasses Swamp until a red card is drawn. With all these enticing, sugarcoated images (and King Kandy plainly visible at path's end), children can't help but be delighted by Candy Land. It's delicious! Instructions are in both Spanish and English. Candy Land is for two to four players) <i>--Julie Ubben</i>"	COL description VAL "Climb up and slide down in the exciting game of ups and downs, Chutes and Ladders! The Chutes and Ladders board game for girls and boys has been around for over 60 years and has been enjoyed by families for generations. Players can see the square marked 100, but how will they get there? If a player lands their pawn on a good deed, they can shimmy up a ladder, but land on the wrong spot and they'll shoot down a chute! No reading is required to play this simple and easy game for preschoolers. Players spin the spinner to see how many spots they'll move. Will their new spot send them down or move them up, up, up? Slip, slide and see who will win the Chutes and Ladders board game. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. Be the first to move your child-shaped playing piece from square one to square 100 on the Chutes and Ladders game board--but watch out! If you land on the square that shows you ate too much candy--Ouch!--you get a tummy ache and slide down a chute to a square a few numbers below. But if you end your turn on a good-deed square, such as helping sweep up a mess, you'll be rewarded by a ladder-climb up the board. A fantastic follow-up to <a href="/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000DMF5/${0}">Candy Land</a>, Chutes and Ladders is ideal for younger children who are still learning to take turns and just beginning to recognize numbers (the spinner stays in the single digits). It's also a gentle introduction to the higher numbers as players climb to 100 at the top of the board. And, thanks to all those chutes and ladders, it's got enough excitement to keep your 7-year-old on the edge of her seat.

The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder?

COL description VAL "Marie Antoinette would have lost her head over this rug. Our only square rug, the Versailles is perfect beneath outdoor or indoor dining or living room furniture. Classically inspired and available in a rich assortment of colors. Mad Mats are made from 100% recycled plastic, are UV protected and fade-proof, and come with our one-year color guarantee. Because our rugs are handmade, pattern, color and size may vary slightly. Mad Mats' patterns are intricately woven. Multi-colored threads are woven in much the same fashion as real flat weave wool rugs. The result is a warmth and depth of color usually only available to the interior rug market. Most outdoor plastic mats on the market today are made from a combination of virgin polypropylene (PPL) and polystyrene. Mad Mats' plastic is completely different. First, our polypropylene is recycled from used soda bottles, milk bottles, packing, etc. We use only the highest grade of this recycled PPL. Then we combine it with state of the art conditioners and U.V. inhibitors to produce soft, resilient colorfast threads. Our soft tubular threads don't absorb dirt or stains of any kind. Leaves, debris, and food spills are easily rinsed away with a garden hose. They are truly carefree! This is a major advantage of Mad Mats. Most outdoor rugs are a dense weave of spun poly thread. They hold moisture for days which then gets tracked into the house. Grass, food, and dirt seep into the fiber where they remain until the rug is pulled up and washed, dried, and put back in place. YUCK! Mad Mats breathe. They don't trap water so they won't mildew and they won't rot wooden decks. Water goes right through them and evaporates right back out of them. Walking on Mad Mats the morning after a rainy night will leave your feet dry enough to walk right into the house. You put it down and that's it! All Mariachi products are produced under fair trade conditions. We do not work with factories that employ children or produce environmentally harmful waste."

Like the rest of the Scallion family, this purple version has a 2.4-inch blade, making it the ideal size for easy, lightweight pocket carry that steps up to just about any task. The razor-sharp blade is made with 420HC high-carbon stainless steel and bead-blasted for an easy-to-maintain matte finish with good edge retention and excellent corrosion resistance. The Scallion comes equipped with SpeedSafe assisted opening, for simple, one-handed blade deployment activated with a simple pull back on the ambidextrous flipper that glides the blade out of the handle. The purple Scallion's aluminum handle scales are anodized to accept the purple dye and produce scratch resistant, colorful handles. A locking steel liner secures the blade open during use and is easy to close for storage. A Tip-Lock adds extra safety when users simply move the slider built into the handle to help guard against accidental opening. Yeah. It's purple. Not only purple, but awesomely purple. The Scallion is already one of our most popular knives, but we thought we'd step it up for 2013 by giving this Scallion some great-looking, jewel tone purple handle scales. The oh-so-handy 2 1/4-inch blade stays the same, ensuring that the purple Scallion is right-sized for lightweight and convenient carry in pocket, purse, or backpack. The blade steel is high-carbon stainless steel that gives you good edge retention and excellent corrosion resistance. We've bead-blasted the blade to give it a soft, matte look and make it easier to maintain, too. Whether you're left-handed or right-handed, the Scallion is quick and easy to open thanks to Speed Safe assisted opening and the Scallion's ambidextrous flipper. Just pull back on the flipper or push on the thumb stud and the blade moves out of the handle, ready for use. The Scallions handle scales are anodized aluminum over steel liners. Anodizing enables the aluminum to take that eye-popping purple color and helps them resist scratching. Even better, anodizing actually strengthens the aluminum so you get a handle that's strong, lightweight and colorful. For safety, the purple Scallion has a locking liner to keep it locked safely open and a Tip-Lock to keep it locked safely closed during transport. If you've been waiting for a more colorful Scallion, the purple Scallion just may be the ticket. Made In The USA, Flipper, Speed Safe, Liner Lock, Single Position."	1

COL description VAL "This push reel lawnmower sharpening kit for 16" wide blades includes two parts - a railed backstop, and three self adhesive abrasive pads. The backstop fits onto the bottom of the mower and holds the abrasive pad in contact with the mower blades. The backstop attaches with a pair of screw clamps, and then all you have to do is push the mower around to sharpen the blades. As they brush against the abrasive strip, any rust, dings, burls, or dings will scrub away, making the blade even and sharp again. While the sharpener is attached, the mower will be slightly more difficult to push than normal. After a few rotations, the blades will sharpen up and the sharpener can be removed. The sharpener should not be used while mowing -- use it on a surface like a flat driveway to sharpen. Abrasive pads are made with aluminum oxide, and each pad can be used several times before it needs replacing. They work just like a sheet of extra fine sandpaper, except that they can hold up to the stress and deliver a smooth, even finish to the edge of your blades. A clean edge to reel mower blades is important because it will result in smoother mowing action. Sharp blades are less likely to catch on the grass, so they produce a smoother and healthier lawn. Mowers with sharp blades are easier to push, gentler on sore joints, and make less noise. This reel mower sharpener is a good choice. If you have a smaller 14" reel mower, you can use this sharpening kit if you have a hacksaw and cut off 2" on one side of the kit."

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

COL description VAL "This hand-woven fleece dog rope is made in America at our Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania studio.

Great for large size dogs. Machine washable and dryable on gentle cycle. Since each rope is individually handcrafted there might be a slight variation from the pictured item. For example - the pattern in the fabric might be cut at a different spot or the knots tied a little differently. Also, the colors may vary slightly because of picture lighting, different computer monitors, tablet screens, and cell phone screens.
