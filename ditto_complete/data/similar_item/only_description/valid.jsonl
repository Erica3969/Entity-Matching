With the K'NEX Atomic Coaster Building Set they can use more than 850 K'NEX pieces to create a thrilling roller coaster building experience. Two dueling cars twist, turn and dive as they race through more than 37' of track. The K'NEX Coaster builds over 4' tall and includes a motorized chain lift. Give your child's mind a challenge. With the K'NEX Roller Coaster, your child can construct two different tracks at once and experience the thrill of watching them race against each other in separate courses. Watch your child experience the pride of having built something so intricate. It makes for an exciting gift that can expand the imagination of a child, and it is sure to provide hours of fun. <div class=\"aplus\"> Create your own thrilling roller coaster at home with the K'NEX Atomic Coaster. Standing four feet tall when constructed, this 1,255-piece kit features a motorized chain lift, color-coded building materials, two racing cars, and twisting, turning tracks. The Atomic Coaster combines the rewarding stimulation of building with the thrill of racing and motor power. After you've conquered the Atomic Coaster, its pieces can be reassembled to make another exciting ride called the Proton Plunge. This exciting K'NEX kit features 1,255 pieces, allowing you to build your Atomic Coaster from the ground up to four feet high. Visual diagrams in the included booklet show you how to connect your K'NEX pieces to steadily transform your coaster from a pile of colored rods and connectors into a towering thrill ride. Once the frame is completed, connect twisting tracks that loop around your structure to create an exhilarating course for your racing cars. Once your cars have made their way down the coaster, a motorized lift uses chains and pulleys you've built into your Coaster to pull the cars back to the top, where they can begin their rapid descent again. The K'NEX motor runs on two AA batteries (not included). Like many construction toys, playing with the Atomic Coaster is more about the journey than it is the destination. The real fun here is putting the coaster together, not necessarily what it does once it's completed. Although this product is intended for children ages nine and older, our testers found that this set may be a bit too complicated for children on the young end of that spectrum without some adult help. The instructions aren't entirely straightforward--the first step in the booklet is actually comprised of a large number of individual steps, many of which require paying close attention to the small visual diagrams and using deductive reasoning to figure out how pieces are aligned. Determining which pieces belong where, based on the diagrams, requires some focused thinking and spatial reasoning. Building the Atomic Coaster properly requires some patience. It took our testers upwards of six hours to fully assemble the Atomic Coaster. The finished product is an impressive sight, and its architect will rightly feel a sense of accomplishment for constructing such an intricate structure. Once assembled, the racing cars lift up the motorized track and zip down the tracks in an endless loop (well, endless as long as you replace the batteries). When you're ready for another challenge, you can use the same pieces to construct another coaster, the Proton Plunge. The instructions for the Proton Plunge can be found on the K'NEX website. 1,255 K'NEX pieces, two coaster cars, motorized chain lift, and instructions.\"\tCOL description VAL \"Clear Rainbow Android Mini Figure Set by Andrew Bell & DYZPlastic.

Scientifically designed with eight grains and nuts, plus a special blend of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, Tropican helps maintain healthy weight levels and enhances plumage. <b>Tropican Lifetime Maintenance Parrot Granules</b> is a scientifically formulated, completely balanced and flavorful maintenance diet for all Conures, Caiques, Quakers, Pionus and Small Amazons. The extruded 4 mm granules are sized to be eaten easily, decreasing waste. Tropican was developed and researched by the Hagen Avicultural Research Institute (HARI) and earns the HARI Seal of Approval. For over two decades, the HARI Flock has been fed exclusively Tropican Formulated diets! Tropican comes in a variety of extruded formulas and sizes to appeal to a variety of birds needs. The Tropican formulated diets includes: Ample fresh food and water should always be available to satisfy the demands of your pet bird. The food and water cups should be cleaned and re-filled daily with fresh water and fresh seeds to keep your pet bird healthy. Breeding parrots need extra protein to trigger reproductive hormones and ensure a healthy egg production. The female also requires more nutrients in her diet when rearing young because she is eating for more than just herself! While fledgling or juvenile parrot species do reach the outward appearance of an adult by the time they are weaned, their bodies on the inside are still developing and do benefit from a little extra &lsquo;punch&rsquo; of nutrients during this stage of their life. Achieve greater weaning success during this stressful time by spoon feeding warm, softened Tropican High Performance Weaning Diet when making the transition from syringe feeding to solid foods. If the babies are fed Tropican Hand Feeding Formula, they&rsquo;ll quickly recognize the same flavor and adapt to eating the softened Tropican on their own. It is suggested to feed Tropican High Performance Tropican Weaning Diet for the first six months after weaning for most parrot species, and up to nine months for large macaw species. Parrots that have been eating a primary diet of traditional parrot seed mix need a little boost to their amino acid profile, as well as other essential nutrients. They&rsquo;ve been getting all the fat they need, perhaps too much. But, they are not getting a complete amino acid profile; therefore, they haven&rsquo;t been getting the right protein. Tropican High Performance is made with ground sunflower meat and peanut kernel, a flavor those seed junkies will be sure to recognize and relish!\"\tCOL description VAL \"The EHEIM professional 3 thermofilter offers the desired constant temperature while maintaining the superior filtration that the EHEIM professional 3 line is known for.\"\t0", "label": 0}

In the early days, the product became popular among cat breeders looking to remove tear stains from their show cats, but soon thereafter its effectiveness was also discovered by the dog market. Years later, Eye Envy launched its Non-Refrigerated NR version, giving the product a longer shelf life which made it appealing to pet boutiques and the retail market. Since its inception, the company has grown with worldwide distribution and maintained its philosophy of only including the best ingredients in its products. Our All-Natural Tear Stain Remover for Dogs is a topical 2 step process: Step 1) Clean the area with the Solution Step 2) Apply Powder (not included in this order). Our Tear Stain Remover does not contain Tylosin or antibiotics. Eye Envy Solutions are natural and do not contain preservatives, bleach, peroxide, steroids, or other harmful agents. It is applied topically and this safe, non-irritating, effective cleanser and beautifier removes unsightly stains and inhibits dark staining production. Apply daily until the stains disappear (typically 1-2 weeks). After initial stain removal apply once weekly to prevent re-staining of the area. Note: If bleach, peroxide or any whitening agents have been used on tear stains prior to using Eye Envy, the hair shaft may become porous and cause new stains to appear that may set permanently. Unfortunately, Eye Envy will only be able to lighten those stains to a light pink color and stain may not fully disappear. Once treated, the re-growth will be white.\"\t0", "label": 0}

His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a \"no light, no pay\" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come. \"\t1", "label": 1}

Figure Measures Approximately 4 Inches Tall. Ages 4 and up. Includes: Bowcaster Rifle & Episode 1 Flashback Photo Card. From Hasbro.  Chewbacca, like all members of the Wookiee species, was indigenous to the jungle planet of Kashyyyk. Honorable, intelligent, and friendly, though fierce and dangerous when angered, Wookiees were a proud species who once made contributions to the Galactic Republic. Wookiee senators represented Kashyyyk in the Galactic Senate. Their respectable position changed, however, when the Imperials seized power and began enslaving the extraordinarily strong Wookiees as laborers. In Chewbacca's case, he escaped slavery and death with the help of a young officer by the name of Han Solo, who destroyed his military career to save the innocent Wookiee. A life debt was established, and Chewbacca joined Han in his adventures through the galaxy. Later on, the duo played significant roles in the Rebel victory over the Empire, and the Wookiee species was restored to its position of honor in the galaxy. In <i>Star Wars</i>, Hoth Chewbacca the Wookie was Han Solo's dependable copilot and sidekick. Once respected citizens of the Galactic Republic, the strong and intelligent Wookies had been enslaved by the Imperials. The Chewbacca action figure is 4.25 inches tall and rotates at the waist, hips, shoulders, and (slightly) at the neck. Chewbacca's weapon of choice--a bowcaster rifle--fits into his right hand.

Commonly referred to as pond hose, flex tubing, our black flexible PVC hose is strong and long lasting, as well as extremely flexible. The black color prevents sunlight penetration which reduces the ability for algae to grow, and makes it practically invisible underwater. The advantage to using black flexible PVC over rigid pipe is that it can be easily routed in any direction without the use of multiple fittings, which makes plumbing your pond, fountain or waterfall much simpler. It can be used in areas where space (for fittings) is limited and/or in situations that rigid pipe is difficult or impossible to work with. It is sunlight, ozone and mildew resistant. A rigid internal PVC spiral (helix) provides strength to resist crushing and impact issues, and this PVC pipe can be used for above-ground or under-ground installations (with proper cushioning). It can also be used as a conduit to run protected electrical, cable, phone or fiber optic lines and can also be used as a protective liner for softer hoses or tubes, or for smaller diameter hoses. It is much stronger than our non kink water garden pond hose, providing longer life, stronger connections and allowing it to be used in more applications. Trimming or cutting is much simpler than with rigid PVC pipe (it can be cut with PVC pipe cutters, a standard hack saw, a carpenters saw, etc.). With a precision controlled outside diameter, it can be easily glued using standard Schedule 40 plumbing fittings and any good, commercially available PVC glue (we recommend the Gorilla Brand cement) for flexible or rigid PVC. It eliminates back pressure caused by sharp turns created by multiple fittings, which increases the efficiency of your system\"\tCOL description VAL \"Such a beautiful garden accent!

Dental Fresh Original Formula is truly the world&rsquo;s first toothbrush in a bottle for your cat. Adding Dental Fresh to your cat&rsquo;s water bowl daily equates to brushing their teeth every time they drink water &ndash; without the struggles and hassles that most pet parents have had when trying to use a toothbrush on an unwilling cat. Dental Fresh is the only clinically-proven formula for cat oral health providing multiple benefits: cleans and whitens teeth, freshens breath, protects gums while treating gingivitis, prevents periodontal disease, and improves overall dental health.<br /> <br /> When cats develop dental disease, it can lead to additional problems throughout their body. That is why it is so important to recognize the signs of dental issues in your cat &ndash; bad breath, yellow or brown teeth, swollen, inflamed, red, puffy gums, weight loss, and poor appetite &ndash; and prioritize oral health. Dental Fresh makes that incredibly easy. <br /> <br /> Our clinically-proven water additive features a unique self-regulating formula that activates, releases and destroys bad breath causing germs and bacteria microorganisms only when exposed to bacteria, periodontal pathogens, and acidic areas where plaque has formed. The more &ldquo;issues&rdquo; present, the stronger the formula works for your cat. And, in turn, the less &ldquo;issues&rdquo; present, the less the formula targets those areas. All of the cats (and dogs!) in your household can safely drink from the same water bowl because each pet will receive a different dosage of the active ingredient, depending on their individual dental needs. And unlike many water bowl additives on the market, Dental Fresh contains no alcohol, no sugar, no surfactants or detergents, and no pungent mint flavors. It does not cause staining, has no taste or artificial flavorings, and can be safely used long-term. Dental Fresh Original Formula for Cats is available in an 8-fluid ounce bottle.<br /> <br /> We know that your cats are more than just pets - they are part of the family - so Dental Fresh designs premium oral health products that pet parents can actually afford. Your cat will have fresher breath, whiter teeth, and healthier gums and you will feel confident knowing that you are being proactive with your cat&rsquo;s oral health &ndash; making you both happy and able to focus on more important things like naps, games and snuggles.\"\t1", "label": 1}

Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary.\"\t0", "label": 0}

Created by a volunteer math aide in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Moneywise Kids contains two simple, fun games that will help kids understand how money works, in terms of dollar value and spending power. In the first game, Bill Maker, kids take turns rolling the dice and earning dollars that are commensurate with the numbers that come up: roll a 2 and a 6, for instance, and you get $8. As they accrue wealth with each turn, players exchange smaller bills for larger ones until someone winds up with $100. In the second game, Bill Breaker, each player starts with $100 and earns more money with each turn, but players must also draw \"moneywise markers\"--bills for such real-life expenses as food, medical care, and taxes--and make payments along the way. And watch out for those hard-luck chips that mean big bills. The player who collects all six markers and still has $100 in savings is the winner. The game is lively and only lightly competitive, with an accent on grasping the mysteries of dollars and cents. <I>--Tom Keogh</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \" Students learn valuable money skills as they try to be the first to cross the finish line. Includes game board with spinner, 100 plastic coins, play bills, markers, and dice. 2-4 players. What a fun way to learn about combining coins! The object of this colorful and compact board game is to earn money while winding along a cartoon path. Money is earned by landing on a square labeled with a practical chore, such as setting the table (31 cents), or an entrepreneurial endeavor, such as a lemonade stand (15 cents). In order to collect money, the spinner is used to determine which coins can or cannot be taken from the bank. If the spinner lands on \"no nickels\" then you collect your change with any coins except for nickels. There's an additional incentive to use critical thinking and coin combining skills. Extra money can be earned if you land on a \"Bank Exchange\" space and exchange your coins (for example, two nickels for a dime).

Money is earned by landing on a square labeled with a practical chore, such as setting the table (31 cents), or an entrepreneurial endeavor, such as a lemonade stand (15 cents). In order to collect money, the spinner is used to determine which coins can or cannot be taken from the bank. If the spinner lands on \"no nickels\" then you collect your change with any coins except for nickels. There's an additional incentive to use critical thinking and coin combining skills. Extra money can be earned if you land on a \"Bank Exchange\" space and exchange your coins (for example, two nickels for a dime). As you may have suspected, the player with the most money at the end wins. <i>--Lauren Bernard</i>\"\t1", "label": 1}

Units sold to California must be CARB-compliant. Routine power outages, rolling blackouts, and natural disasters can cause major disruptions in your life, but being able to generate your own power goes a long way toward keeping you and your family safe and comfortable. Designed for safe and easy operation, the HW5500 features a recoil start and Smart Start features with color-coded starting controls that are easy to identify and understand (see a <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/outdoor-living/detailpages/honeywell/honeywell-gen-SmartStart-instructions-lg.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">larger image with detailed instructions</a>). The generator includes a four-in-one power cord, and Honeywell also provides detailed operating instructions 24 hours a day at 1-888-RECOIL-8. Designed to offer you more power and greater durability, this generator's cast-ironed sleeved, 337cc Honeywell Engine is rated at 5500 watts and delivers a maximum of 6875 watts. This is enough power to run a large appliance like a dishwasher, washing machine, or electric range, or to run several smaller, more efficient appliances simultaneously, such as reading lights, a portable air conditioner, refrigerator, computer, and more. (See side graphic for more details.) Thanks to a SurePower Alternator that provides voltage-regulated power, you can trust that this generator is electronics friendly. Plus the HW5500 provides the outlets you need to support these appliances, with four 15/20-Amp 120-volt AC outlets and a single L14-30-Amp 120/240-volt AC outlet. This Honeywell generator comes equipped with never-flat tires and a high-leverage handle to ensure that it's easy to transport whenever and wherever you need it most. Additionally, the generator's large, 6.5-gallon fuel tank ensures long run times--up to 11 hours at a 50-percent load. And its oversized muffler is engineered to ensure quiet operation that blends into the background. The HW5500 also offers a convenient fuel gauge, low-oil protection, and overload protection, letting you focus on your life rather than running the generator itself. It even comes with the first liter of oil and a funnel. This portable generator measures 29 x 27 x 29 inches (LxHxW), weighs just 205 pounds, and is backed by a limited three-year warranty.

There, he and the cutlers union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldiers Knife and in 1897 with the Officers Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as inoxydable\" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.<br> <br> Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland. <br> <br> <b>Care Tips for Swiss Army Knives</b><br> The various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.<br> <br> <b>Sharpening</b><br> To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15 20. This will result in a cutting angle of 30 40. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.<br> <br> <b>Cleaning</b><br> After youve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher.\"\tCOL description VAL \" <b>Plug and Play </b> Light Kit! / <b>Super Bright</b> LEDs! /<b> Flexible Waterproof</b> Strips!

This flooring option is perfect for a variety of antivibration and floor protection applications. Because the material is domestically made with 100% recycled rubber, this mat is both socially and ecologically responsible. This product is excellent for indoor or outdoor applications due to high contents of EPDM (i.e., a UV/Ozone resistant elastomer) found in the recycled tire rubber. Recycled rubber is a superior material for reducing noise, containing vibration, and absorbing shock from workout equipment. This floor protector mat is specifically manufactured for durability and is designed for both residential and commercial applications often exposed to heavy foot traffic. Moreover, the space-age polyurethane based binder used during the manufacturing process enhances rubber's natural anti-fatigue qualities. Each washing machine vibration mat is fabricated from thousands of rubber granules and offers superior underfoot comfort and support along with a resilient cushioning for the shock of running, exercising, walking and standing. One of the biggest concerns commonly associated with rubber matting is its installation. However, this anti vibration pat weighs roughly 50lbs in a 4ft x 10ft roll and generally lies flat under its own weight; therefore there is no need for permanent adhesives.\"\t0", "label": 0}

They count on products that enable them to do their best-day in and day out-with speed, precision and ease. That is why chefs all around the world have made Mundial their top choice for professional-grade knives. Mundial Inc., headquartered in Walpole, MA, is the North American marketing, sales and distribution arm of Mundial S.A., whose corporate offices are located in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Mundial S.A. develops and manufactures over 95% of its own products including fully forged and stamped cutlery, sewing and craft scissors, manicure implements, metal fasteners and motors. The group and the Mundial trademark were established in Germany in 1931 by Paul Zivi. This noted metallurgist, along with his team of skilled engineers and designers, developed the most sophisticated techniques for designing and manufacturing high quality cutlery. This allegiance to quality has been maintained throughout the years for all of Mundial's products. Today, every Mundial product is produced under a rigorous quality control program that spans the entire manufacturing process from the development of the steel to the final polishing of the blade. Upon completion, every Mundial product is individually tested to ensure sharpness, precision and durability. As proof of its commitment to quality and customer satisfaction, Mundial stands behind its products, backing every one with a full Lifetime Guarantee against defects in materials, construction and workmanship. Mundial Inc. is currently among the leading North American brands of cutlery and kitchen accessories sold to the restaurant and institutional markets. It is also a leader in the retail and industrial scissors/shears categories. With a growing business in retail cutlery through gourmet, specialty and department stores, Mundial products are squarely positioned as high quality and upscale, but with a distinct value advantage. Thanks to manufacturing efficiencies and more competitive costs of raw materials (Brazil is one of the largest producers of steel in the world), Mundial can position its top quality products at extremely affordable retail prices. Mundial combines Old World craftsmanship with modern technology to produce a broad selection of products unmatched in the world for strength, durability, beauty, comfort and value. Mundial's 5600 Series of professional cutlery and cooking accessories is crafted from high-carbon stainless steel in order to combine the highest edge retention with easy resharpening. Each knife features an ergonomically designed handle that provides a secure non-slip grip even when wet. Mundial carefully matches each blade and handle so that they're perfectly balanced. A good grip and perfect balance minimize fatigue and make even large-scale food preparation fast, easy and precise. All 5600 Series knives are NSF approved, meeting all foodservice industry standards for sanitation. Mundial 5600 Series knives and accessories have Sanitized Antimicrobial Protection, which is the safe treatment of the polypropylene handles to guard against the growth of bacteria, yeast, mold and fungi. Mundial knives are also NSF approved, ensuring that they meet all foodservice industry standards for sanitation. But that is just the beginning, Mundial knives are also thoughtfully designed to simplify food preparation tasks, ensure comfort and minimize fatigue-even after a long and demanding day in the kitchen. Mundial begins by selection high-carbon stainless steel to combine the highest edge retention with easy resharpening. The company's computer-aided design process creates the perfect shape for each knife according to its function. Computerized grinding and polishing machines ensure precise tapering from tip to bolster. Finally, to deliver optimum performance, every Mundial knife is hand sharpened and individually tested. Mundial puts just as much thought and effort into the design and manufacture of its knife handles. Each is ergonomically designed and crafted to provide a secure non-slip grip even when wet. Mundial carefully matched each blade and handle so that they are perfectly balanced. A good grip and perfect balance minimize fatigue and make even large-scale food preparation fast, easy and precise. 5600 Series knives and accessories have Sanitized Antimicrobial Protection, which is the safe treatment of the polypropylene handles to guard against bacteria, yeast, mold and fungi growth. During the manufacturing process, Sanitized additives are incorporated directly into the knife handles, protecting them against microbial attack. The inclusion of these additives also decreases the risk of unpleasant odors while improving the hygiene of the knives. Sanitized Antimicrobial Protection is a highly respected and widely used technology all across the world. The process is continually tested in accordance with international standards. All test results support the safety, quality and effectiveness of products protected with Sanitized additives. While Sanitized Antimicrobial Protection adds an extra safeguard against bacterial growth in materials, thorough cleaning and maintenance is still required on all products treated with Sanitized additives. Mundial's 5600 Series knives are fully traceable. During the manufacturing process a unique tracking number is stamped on each blade, which enables the knives to be positively identified throughout their useful life. This tracking system facilitates quality assurance and quality monitoring while also providing controls for scheduled sterilization and resharpening. Useful life cycles can also be established, which facilitate re-ordering and minimize investment in inventory while maximizing productivity.\"\t0", "label": 0}

Dimensions: 29\"H x 60\"W x 16\"D\"\tCOL description VAL \" Add a handsome yet highly functional tool to your kitchen arsenal with this solid, reversible, wooden cutting board from John Boos. Made of hard maple with edge-grain construction for durability, the cutting board provides two smooth surfaces on either side, slightly rounded edges, and indented hand grips on either end for comfortable, convenient handling. The finely crafted board, which measures 24 by 18 by 1-1/2 inches, works well for a variety of food-prep tasks like chopping meat, slicing and dicing fruits and vegetables, or mincing fresh herbs. Keep the cutting board clean by simply washing it with hot soapy water after each use and dry it with a clean paper towel or let it air dry. The board was shipped from the factory with a penetrating natural oil finish, which allows for great cutting, chopping, and slicing, but it's important to give the cutting board a good oiling on all surfaces every three to four weeks. When the cutting board becomes dry and lighter in color, it's time to re-oil, which is an easy way to lengthen the life of the board by many years. More appealing and attractive than plastic, a wooden cutting board is a great alternative to plastic cutting boards as it can inhibit bacteria growth, while plastic boards harbor bacteria in the grooves cut into their surface. (Although Boos cutting boards do not harbor bacteria, it is a good habit to use separate cutting boards for different types of food prep.) Wood cutting boards are also easier on knives, where plastic boards can dull knives quickly. Boos cutting boards are manufactured by John Boos & Co. in Effingham, Illinois, which has been manufacturing high-quality wood cutting boards, butcher blocks, and countertops since 1887. Every professional or at-home chef knows the importance of a good cutting board. John Boos has developed a full line of professional-quality FDA-approved cutting boards in a variety of styles to accommodate individual needs and preferences. Choose from end-grain or edge-grain construction and from over 39 shapes and sizes. John Boos & Co. is the oldest industry in South Central Illinois, located in Effingham Illinois, and the company has been in business since 1887. Conrad Boos Sr. founded the business in 1887 and named it after his son, John. For many years he worked out of the blacksmith shop in Effingham, and lumber was cut from areas in close proximity. In 1892, the plant moved to its present location at 315 South First Street in Effingham. The blacksmith used a Sycamore tree placed on three legs to straighten horseshoes. The wooden block absorbed the shock of the hammer. In 1890, a local butcher realized the block could be used for cutting meat, and had one made for this purpose. The word spread to surrounding small towns and cities and by 1911, John Boos was shipping from coast to coast. Commercial meat markets were very popular through the 1959, and with the advent of dishwashers and plastic, the commercial market began to feel the impact of a lower-cost alternative, though perhaps not as safe! In 1956, John Boos began to take some of their products to local retail shops and offer the blocks and cutting boards for resale. Merchants would sell these products to consumers for home use. Today, it is common to see John Boos cutting boards in both the commercial kitchen of hotels and restaurants, culinary schools and even cooking shows on television. The old craftsmen work ethic is still around at John Boos & Co. There have been a few changes, though. Sycamore lumber is no longer used--John Boos manufactures premium Hard Rock Maple lumber from surrounding states in the mid-west, most of which comes from the Northern States. And John Boos automation has replaced much of the older equipment. The 1942 block press is one piece of equipment that's still very much in use today, however. John Boos & Co. utilizes 100% of their raw material to benefit the manufacturing processes. The smallest lumber scraps are transformed into sawdust and used as the material of choice to generate electricity and create steam to fuel the boilers. The steam is also used to operate the glue presses and dry kilns. Any saw dust unused by the company is provided to the local agricultural industry. In 1892 the Boos family sold interest in the company to the Gravenhorst family. (There is currently a fifth generation Gravenhorst working for the company. T.S. Gravenhorst, III was named President in 1978 and held that office until retirement in 2002.) In 1895 the building burned and was rebuilt; however, in1899 it was decided that more space was needed, and it was then that they moved to the present site of 315 South First Street. The building was purchased from the old Effingham furniture manufacturing company. In 1920, extra buildings and kiln capacity were added. By the 1940s, butcher blocks were found in every restaurant, food store and butcher shop in America. Then came World War II, which was instrumental in changing the manufacturing philosophy of the management at John Boos and also the course of the business. In 1955, the company expanded by adding a dry kiln, increasing its office space and adding more manufacturing space. The shipping docks were enlarged, warehousing space added and new products added. In addition to the standard old-style butcher blocks, butcher block tops, which are laminated strips of northern hard rock maple or Appalachian red oak, were in great demand, not only in the foodservice industry, but also in the home. The company continued to expand during the late 1960s and early '70s with the growth of its metal fabricated table market. Metal tables had replaced the butcher block as a necessary product in the majority of foodservice/supermarket establishments. Tables with poly or synthetic tops, stainless-steel tops and maple tops were being manufactured. And even though the government was tough on wood products through the 1970s and '80s, the company continued to grow with its new line of BDL store fixtures, park benches and other butcher block furniture items. The wood and metal products are listed with the National Sanitation Foundation, the leader in sanitation agencies for approving equipment to be installed in foodservice and supermarket operations. The products must have approval of various sanitation agencies in order to be accepted by the industry. John Boos & Co. Cucina products, butcher blocks and cutting boards are being used by celebrity chefs throughout the United States. Celebrity chefs currently using John Boos products are Charlie Trotter, Ming Tsai, Paul Kahan, Susan Spicer at Bayona Restaurant in New Orleans, and Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feninger at Border Grill in Santa Monica, California. In addition, the country's premier food channel, \"The Food Network\" features chefs such as Mario Batali and Emeril Lagasse, who prepare meals every day on John Boos cutting boards. In most cases Boos cutting boards are used on the daily and weekly television programs sponsored for the chefs. In 1994 we were awarded the Gold Medal for Excellence in Foodservice Equipment by the Chefs of America. This ceremony was conducted at Carnegie Hall in New York City, and we were 1 of only 22 companies receiving awards. Hard Rock Maple is the board of choice among professionals because it's friendly to a knife's edge, has anti-bacterial properties, and the larger boards are skid-free, and stay firm while in use. There are also many board designs for different applications and use. John Boos edge-grain-constructed hard maple boards are NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) certified, this regulatory agency governs the commercial markets, as it pertains to particular health and sanitization codes. Still many are unaware of the studies conducted by the NSF, Dr. Dean Cliver, and others, on how the maple boards kill bacteria. Keep your Boos cutting board clean by simply washing it with hot soapy water after each use and dry it with a clean paper towel or let it air dry. If you want to sanitize the board more thoroughly, a diluted mixture of chlorine bleach or vinegar solution consisting of one teaspoon of liquid chlorine bleach in one quart of water or a one to five dilution of vinegar. Do not soak or submerge the board in water, for this will disrupt the moisture content and cause the rails to split. Wood cutting boards are NOT dishwasher-safe. It is extremely important to give your cutting board a good oiling on all surfaces every 3-4 weeks. Your Boos board shipped from the factory with a Boos block cream finish with beeswax, which protects and prolongs the life of your board. We recommend keeping the board oiled with John Boos Mystery Oil and/or Boos Block Cream with Beeswax. The company currently occupies approximately 150,000 square feet of total production capacity in Effingham, IL and approximately 65,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity in Philipsburg, PA and Suring, WI, which produce wooden school furniture. The company has four dry kilns that will dry up to 210,000 board feet of lumber on a continual basis. There are 140 employees in the Effingham facility. Most of the hardwoods used for manufacturing is shipped from Great Lakes states via truck, while our second largest commodity, stainless steel, comes from steel warehouses and distribution centers in Chicago, Indianapolis, and St. Louis. The company currently is cutting up about five million feet of maple and oak each year. A research team led by Dean O. Cliver, Ph.D compared plastic and wooden cutting boards. Their research was first intended to develop means of disinfecting wooden cutting surfaces at home, so that they would be almost as safe as plastics. They found that disease bacteria were not recoverable from wooden surfaces in a short time after they were applied, unless very large numbers were used. New plastic surfaces allowed the bacteria to persist, but were easily cleaned and disinfected. However, wooden boards that had been used and had many knife cuts acted almost the same as new wood, whereas plastic surfaces that were knife-scarred were impossible to clean and disinfect manually, especially when food residues such as chicken fat were present. Scanning electron micrographs revealed highly significant damage to plastic surfaces from knife cuts. Although the bacteria that have disappeared from the wood surfaces are found alive inside the wood for some time after application, they evidently do not multiply, and they gradually die. They can be detected only by splitting or gouging the wood or by forcing water completely through from one surface to the other. If a sharp knife is used to cut into the work surfaces after used plastic or wood has been contaminated with bacteria and cleaned manually, more bacteria are recovered from a used plastic surface than from a used wood surface. The research team has no commercial relationships to any company making cutting boards or other food preparation utensils. They believe, on the basis of their published and to-be-published research, that food can be prepared safely on wooden cutting surfaces and that plastic cutting surfaces present some disadvantages that had been previously overlooked. In conclusion, they believe their research shows evidence that wooden cutting boards are not a hazard to human health, but plastic cutting boards may be.\"\t0", "label": 0}

The Dual Ramp Timer is a fully programmable 24 hour LED lighting controller that not only turns your lights on and off, it also simulates gentle sunrise, sunset and moonlight for your critters. Designed for both freshwater and marine aquariums, it's extremely simple to use and slowly acclimates animals to the bright light that LEDs produce. Featuring two independent lighting channels, each channel can be programmed for on/off times, as well as minimum and maximum intensity/brightness. At each pre-programmed ion time, the Dual Ramp Timer slowly begins to mimic a morning sunrise by gently increasing the lighting level of each channel over 15 minutes. When the programmed off time is reached, it gradually dims the light over 15 minutes, ending at your minimum intensity setting - simulating a soft dusk to night. If you want some lunar lighting, simply set your blue channel to a low intensity and the moon will glow all night. By mimicking dawn and dusk, your animals are provided a soothing adjustment to full brightness and darkness, helping to prevent any sudden or stressful light shock. The next day, the schedule starts all over again, creating a natural circadian rhythm to the 24 hour light-dark cycle.\"\t0", "label": 0}

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"First on the market with removable side bat sleeves, Vista CTR is our standard size bat equipment roller backpack for softball/baseball players.

These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag: <strong><font color=CC6600>Buy for Cold</font></strong><br> It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10. Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for \"warm\" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night. <strong><font color=CC6600>Goose or No Goose?</font></strong><br> The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly <i>and</i> stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use. All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget. <strong><font color=CC6600>Bags for All Shapes</font></strong><br> Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips. <strong><font color=CC6600>Pad Yourself</font></strong><br> No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you. \"\tCOL description VAL \"The Redwood is a \"heavy duty\" oversized rectangle bag.

This game is deceptively simple to learn, but can become as delightfully complex as chess. Strategy is the key, but you'll need dexterity as well, because you don't just place the pieces, you float them. To set up the game, lay out the cloth game mat on any surface. It's best to start on an even surface, but as your skills advance you can play just about anywhere. Once the players have selected colors and split the 52 discs, each lays out five foundation pieces in a circle. After that, you place \"learners\", pieces that float in the air due to their repulsion of the magnetic fields. You have to be careful when you place your learner so as not to create a fault, that is to cause other pieces to flip, stick and form towers. You can capture towers to win, but if you cause faults, the towering pieces go into your unplayed stack. When one player runs out of pieces to play, the towers are counted, unplayed pieces are subtracted from the total and the player with the most pieces wins. But be careful, you can lose immediately if you touch the red disc in the center, cause it to leave the center or have no discs on the play mat with your color showing. It sounds simple, but it is simply wonderful fun, calling for both manual and mental skills. Polarity comes in a great, easy-to-carry canvas bag, with instructions and game pieces. Once you start, plan on becoming addicted. You'll want to join the online forums where beginners and experts discuss strategy, leaning and wild tales of Polarity. Get the balance right and learn to lean when you play Polarity.\"\tCOL description VAL \"\"The best spanosh card in the world give us this unique design, with a double header, means that you do not have to turn around your cards if you have them upside down. like you would do with regular spanish playing Cards.

It uses a molded plastic nose piece on the glider that insures easy release of the engine pod after the rocket reaches apogee. The glider then flies gently to the ground while the engine pod descends via an aluminized plastic streamer.This is a very rugged glider, and is great for modelers wanting to try something a bit different. The glider is made from the stiff and lightweight wood of the Chinese Tung tree.<BR> <BR>The Condor Boost Glider rocket can fly with standard size rocket engines and is just as impressive in the sky as on the launch pad. It descends to the ground with a 18 inch diameter parachute.<BR> <BR>The quality of the plastic parts, such as the injection molded fins and the blow molded nose cone is very impressive. About the only difference from USA made kits is that the engine mount is ever so slightly larger due to a small difference between the rocket motors flown by Chinese modelers versus the standard 18mm diameter motors flown here in the USA. But 18mm diameter motors work just fine in this kit; no modifications are needed.<BR> <BR>One neat feature of the rocket is the convolutely wound paper body tubes. The tubes of the Condor rocket are unique in that it is convolutely rolled, as opposed to the spiral-wound tubes that are in other rockets. Convolutely wound means a whole sheet of paper was rolled up to make a tube. It is a little bit stronger than a spiral wound tube because there are no seams along the length of the tube. The other advantage of this is that the pattern of the rocket can be printed right on the model! With this rocket, you'll get a multi-color pattern that looks great when sitting on your display shelf.<BR> <BR>Recommended 18mm diameter rocket engine: Estes A8-3, B6-4, C6-5, Apogee Components D10-5, or Quest Aerospace A6-4<BR> <BR>Requires a rocket launch pad, plus assembly supplies like glue and tape.\"\tCOL description VAL \"SANDYLION-Classpak Stickers.

Simply start the engine with one quick pull, and you're ready to mow. Because it's powered by rear wheel drive, the Lawn-Boy 10641 maneuvers well on irregular surfaces.

Alternatively, you can collect the grass and leaf clippings directly into the bag, leaving your lawn neat and clean. For further convenience, the height of the blades is easily adjustable by setting the oversized handle grips to one of the large notches on each wheel.

To start, a one-piece handle increases maneuverability, and the lightweight, 20-inch steel cutting deck is perfect for mowing in tight areas. Additionally, the top-mounted bagging system makes it easy to empty and replace the bag by simply inserting or removing the grass bag handle from the two notches at the base of the mower handle. <strong>Warranty Information</strong><br />The Lawn-Boy 10641 Walk-Behind Mower is guaranteed to start on one or two pulls for three years, or it will be fixed for free.

About <strong>Design Toscano</strong>: Design Toscano is the country's premier source for statues and other historical and antique replicas, which are available through our catalog and website. We were named in Inc. magazine's list of the 500 fastest growing privately-held companies for three consecutive years - an honor unprecedented among catalogers. Our founders, Michael and Marilyn Stupak, created Design Toscano in 1990. While on a trip to Paris, the Stopkas first saw the marvelous carvings of gargoyles and water spouts at the Notre Dame Cathedral. Inspired by the beauty and mystery of these pieces, they decided to introduce the world of medieval gargoyles to America in 1993. On a later trip to Albi, France, the Stopkas had the pleasure of being exposed to the world of Jacquard tapestries that they added quickly to the growing catalog. Since then, our product line has grown to include Egyptian, Medieval and other period pieces that are now among the current favorites of Design Toscano customers, along with an extensive collection of garden fountains, statuary, authentic canvas replicas of oil painting masterpieces, and other antique art reproductions. At Design Toscano, we pride ourselves on attention to detail by traveling directly to the source for all historical replicas. Over 90% of our catalog offerings are to the Design Toscano brand, allowing us to present unusual decorative items unavailable elsewhere. Our attention to detail extends throughout the company, especially in the areas of customer service and shipping.\"\t0", "label": 0}

Originally created for exclusive European collectors, each plush animal is meticulously handcrafted from portraits of real animals in their natural habitat.  By themselves, or paired with other Hansa Animals, these marvelous creatures make wonderful best friends for children, adults, and collectors alike.  In addition, interior designers the world over often turn to Hansa animals when designing unique, one-of-a-kind spaces.  Display them in groups, or use their large, signature animals to set the theme of a room.Hansas chief designer pulls from his background in anatomy when researching each animal.  The fabric used for the spotted and striped animals is all custom designed to Hansas exacting specifications in small quantites.  And all of the fabric used is hand-cut from intricate patterns and hand-trimmed by Hansa artisans, never stamped out by machines. An average of 42 seperate pieces are used for each small animal (some animals have as many as 240 different pieces).  The face and body of each Hansa Animal is carefully sculpted inside-out to create their distinct features and musculature that are unique to each animal. And each face is hand finished, which means that each animal is unique  just as in real life.And every Hansa animal comes with a Toys that Teach tag describing each animals habitat, lifestyle, gestation period, care of their young and eating habits.  Hansas goal is to help educate children and adults alike about the natural lives of these magnificent creatures, and to understand, respect and appreciate the importance of our co-existence with all animals. What makes Hansa Toys different from their competitors is the quality and pin point accuracy of specific animal characteristics that are used in each production. Artists create each Hansa animal from portraits of the creature in its natural habitat. Most fabrics are custom designed and exclusively manufactured to Hansa's exacting specifications. The animal's coats are meticulously hand-cut and trimmed, never stamped out by machine. The animals are hand sewn inside out, resulting in the minimization of seams. This development of an exceptional internal stitching method allows the Hansa artisans create effects like muscle tone and features unique to each creature. On average, there are 42 separate pieces required to make each animal. (Some animals have as many as 240 different parts!) The subtle coloring on the animals is hand painted or airbrushed by specially trained Hansa artisans. Each animal is hand finished with loving detail to give them the life like look yet sweet face and cuddly feel that is unmistakably Hansa. Hansa'S goal is to help educate children and adults alike, about the natural lives of these magnificent creatures; to understand, respect and appreciate the importance of our co-existence with all animals.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Bring home the exact EFX 835 used in fitness clubs worldwide.

As players move their pieces around the board, they uncover tools such as a boat, key, or magic potion. These are used to get past six obstacles that guard the princess: a moat, a guard dog, a sentry, a locked door, a dark tunnel, and a magic spell. It's a race against time, because in addition to objects, the board contains spaces that advance the coming of the night and the end of the game. Cooperation comes into play when players help each other come up with creative uses for the various objects. The horse, for example, might be used to swim the moat or run past the dog, or might be traded to the guard as a bribe. Since all players are working toward a common goal, everyone wins or loses as a team.\"\t1", "label": 1}

After all LP or natural gas and electrical connections are completed, the Generac 5871 is ready to run 24/7 and requires absolutely no manual operation, no fueling, and no extension cords. The generator responds within seconds of power outages, so inconveniences like heat or air conditioning loss and burst pipes or spoiled food are quickly avoided. Initial setup is easy. The generator arrives pre-wired and equipped with the necessary installation gear: a 10-circuit transfer switch (NEMA 1, indoor-rated only), pre-wired conduits, an outdoor connection box, a flexible fuel line pigtail, and a composite mounting pad. (Additional items and tools may be needed to complete the installation to meet local codes. Consult a licensed professional for further details.) The unit can be programmed to perform a weekly exercise at the time of your choice, so it will be ready for continuous and reliable operation on a moment's notice. For your convenience, it also offers a two-line LCD digital controller, an at a glance indicator light and system status LED, plus an easy-to-access external main circuit breaker.  <strong> Superior Technology for Secure Output, Quiet Operation, and Durability </strong> <br /> Thanks to Generac's exclusive True Power Technology, this generator provides clean, continuous power, so sensitive electronics and microchip appliances like laptops and HVAC equipment can be operated without the worry that unexpected power surges bring. The ultra-quiet design means that noise levels during self-tests are 1/3 quieter than portable generators, so your daily routine is unaffected. <br /> The generator's corrosion-resistant, galvanized steel enclosure is protected by Generac's proprietary RhinoCoat system--a unique process that binds the paint to the metal surface for a long-lasting, durable finish. This allows the generator to sit outdoors and withstand harsh weather conditions without developing an unsightly appearance. Like all Generac generators, this model is UL (Underwriters Laboratories) listed for safety. <strong> Rugged, Worry-Free Design </strong> <br /> The generator features the 530cc Generac OHVI&reg; Engine, an exclusive air-cooled generator engine with a high-performance design that can accommodate large electrical loads. The engine optimizes power to respond swiftly to changing conditions. To add to your peace of mind, the engine requires routine maintenance only once every two years, or after 200 hours of use. This Generac generator meets CARB requirements. It requires a Group 26R 12-volt minimum 525 CCA battery (sold separately). <strong> What's in the Box </strong> <br /> <!-- MODEL NUMBER HERE --> Generac Guardian Series 5871 10,000 / 9,000 Watt (LP/NG) Automatic Standby Steel Generator; 100 Amp NEMA 1 automatic transfer switch with 10 circuit load center; 30-foot, 5-foot, and 2-foot pre-wired conduits; outdoor connection box; 1-foot flexible fuel line pigtail; composite mounting pad; installation guide and owner's manual. <br clear=\"all\" /> <style type=\"text/css\"> .matrix {font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif;font-size: 10px;} .matrix_header {font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif;font-size: 12px;font-weight: bold;} .matrix_title {font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif;font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;} ul.matrix {list-style: inside disc;text-indent: -12px;font-size: 12px;line-height: 1.5em;} </style>\"\tCOL description VAL \"The Bear Chair Company has been providing quality outdoor furniture since 1987.

Turned down to \"warm,\" it even works as a chafing dish on a buffet table. Sensitive temperature control means a boil can reduce to a simmer in seconds, much like cooking over a gas burner. The dial reads in degrees like the dial of an oven; the 300-degree mark on the temperature control is equivalent to medium, a good heat for pan frying. A glass lid shows what's cooking without having to remove the lid. Both the interior and exterior of the pan are coated with a Dupont Teflon nonstick surface; to avoid scratching it, wooden and nylon utensils are best. The pan is fully immersible after removing the temperature control probe, so clean-up takes only a few quick swipes of a warm, soapy sponge. (Nylon scrubbers only; steel wool will scratch the nonstick finish). The cooking surface measures 16 by 12 inches; the actual dimensions of the appliance, including handles and legs, are 19-1/2 by 12 by 5-1/2 inches.

Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary.\"\tCOL description VAL \"The open center design makes this rack an ideal choice for mounting around a lighting fixture or skylight.

This family tent boasts interior lighting powered by cutting-edge solar LED technology with red LEDs that won't impair night vision. 8 hour charge provides 8 hours of light when set on high. Utilizes same super-durable, lightweight, and flexible solar panels as used on Eureka! Military tents. Also functions as a AA battery charger; 2 rechargeable batteries included. Compact fold size for easy transport. Eureka Tents are designed with Stormshield construction to protect campers from the elements. Stormshield design allows for cross-ventilation through the use of windows, vents, and breathable fabrics while bathtub floors wrap up the sides of the tent to keep rain outside of the tent. All major seams are factory sealed to prevent leakage. Eureka uses top quality fabrics and are reinforced in high stress areas to protect wear and tear. The durable guyouts are designed to hold tight even during the most difficult of weather. Eureka's shock-corded poles allow for easy and fast set-up without any guesswork or missing parts to find. Zippers are self healing which keep windows and doors working without a catch. Eureka's been making tents for over 100 years. Since 1895 Eureka has focused on high quality affordable tents and has made tents for American forces in WW II and for Everest expeditions. Roomy, well ventilated, and easy to set up, the unique Eureka Solar Intent dome-style family tent comfortably sleeps five or six, and is a great choice for car camping, base camp, or three-season backpacking. It comes with its own solar-powered interior LED light. During the day, just attach the LED unit to any guyout loop on the fly to charge--an 8-hour charge provides 8 hours of light. At night, the LED unit suspends from the ceiling to illuminate the tent interior. The LED unit folds to 5-1/2\" x 5-1/4\" x 1-1/2\" for easy transport and doubles as a AAA battery charger (three rechargeable batteries included). The double-coated StormShield polyester fly and the polyester bathtub floor combine to provide excellent weather protection.

Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents. The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM \"tent cities\" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased. In 1960, Eurekas new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition. For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary. Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Womens Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian. <strong><font color=CC6600><BIG>Amazon.com Tent Guide</BIG></font></strong><br> <strong><font color=CC6600>Selecting a Tent</font></strong><br> Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: <strong><font color=CC6600>Expect the Worst</font></strong><br> In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity. <strong><font color=CC6600>Three- and Four-Season Tents</font></strong><br> For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness. For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. <strong><font color=CC6600>Domes and Tunnels</font></strong><br> Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. <strong><font color=CC6600>Size Matters</font></strong><br> Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Whether youre headed to the campground with your family, or elk camp with your hunting buddies, this rugged, all-season tent is well suited for the occasion. Made with premium grade, Hydra-Shield, 100% cotton duck canvas. The tight weave and silicone finish make the canvas watertight yet breathable, minimizing condensation and mugginess. Go ahead and touch the inside walls during a downpourthis canvas will not wick water. The Flex-Bow frame has tempered, spring steel rods that keep the tent taut, and robust 1-inch steel tube poles that will hold up to fierce winds. The floor is a seamless, heavy-duty, puncture resistant, 16 oz vinyl that keeps water out. Easy, one-person setup takes only a few minutes after you have it staked out. The steep walls and 66 high ceiling provide a roomy interior with stand-up, walk-around comfort. Large front and back doors with top rated #10 YKK zippers give convenient access. Four windows, and two vents allow ample air flow. Windows and vents have no-see-um screen mesh, keeping out the smallest bugs. A customizable gear loft and organizer system offer plenty of places to stow gear. A large awning provides shade and a covered entry. The handy strap-and-cinch storage bag means no cramming a tent into an undersized bag. Hefty 12-inch steel stakes included. Whether you're heading to the campground with the family or the elk camp with your hunting buddies, the rugged, all-season Kodiak Canvas Flex-Bow eight-person tent is well suited to the occasion. The Flex-Bow tent is made of a superior, marine-grade, 100-percent cotton duck Hydra-Shield canvas. The custom-woven, treated canvas is ideal for tents, as the double-fill design is strong and durable, while the silicone, dry-finish treatment is watertight, breathable, and durable. As a result, campers will stay comfortable and dry even in a downpour. Unlike synthetic fabrics or canvas with a paraffin- or oil-based treatment, Kodiak's canvas allows water vapor to escape, minimizing condensation, humidity, and mugginess. Plus, you'll rarely--if ever--have to retreat Kodiak canvas. The Flex-Bow frame is every bit as strong, with 1-inch galvanized steel tubing and 3/8-inch Flex-Bow spring steel rods keeping the tent taut at all times. To further improve ventilation, the tent includes two funnel-flow vents that circulate air and assist with temperature management. And campers won't feel claustrophobic thanks to the tent's spacious 6-foot 6-inch ceiling height, two large D-shaped doors (front and back), and four large windows, all covered with no-see-um mesh. Other details include a 16-ounce, polyester-reinforced vinyl floor; a large 84-by-78-inch awning; a customizable gear loft and organizer pockets; and a handy strap-and-cinch storage bag. The Flex-Bow, which sets up easily with one person, is designed for year-round use, but isn't suitable for extreme winter mountaineering or heavy snow accumulations. <table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"10\" width=\"300\"> <tbody><tr><td><img align=\"top\" border=\"0\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/sport-goods/detail-pages/B001NZWQ1C-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>The Flex-Bow's spacious footprint sleeps up to 8 people.</strong></em></small></td></tr></tbody></table> <b>Specifications</b><br> <ul> <li>Capacity: 8 people <li>Ceiling material: 10-ounce Hydra-Shield canvas <li>Wall material: 8.5-ounce Hydra-Shield canvas <li>Floor material: 16-ounce polyester-reinforced vinyl with welded seams <li>Frame: 1-inch galvanized steel tubing <li>Rods: 3/8-inch solid spring steel Flex-Bow rods <li>Tent dimensions: 10 by 14 feet <li>Ceiling height: 6 feet 6 inches <li>Pack weight: 79 pounds (includes stakes weighing 6.5 pounds total) <li>Pack size: 30 by 16 inches, with pole bundle measuring 48 inches long and 5.5 inches in diameter <li>Warranty: Limited lifetime warranty </ul> <b>About Kodiak Canvas</b><br> Born in the ruggedness of the Rockies, Kodiak Canvas has quickly earned a reputation for making tough, long-lasting tents ideal for almost any camping scenario.

For warriors who need to be prepared at any moment to duel with Sith Lords or enemies of the Republic, this weapon swiftly extends to over three feet long with the sliding of a button, and then it's ready to help save the galaxy. The spring-activated blade is made with translucent blue plastic. Built-in segments fully retract into the handle, and the blade is illuminated with bands of light. While it's intended for use against another lightsaber -- and not a person or animal -- the blade is built from a safer, softer plastic than the durable, hard plastic handle, just in case. The silver handle features dynamic looking black, gold, and red accents.<P>  <b>Realistic Sounds</b><br> For over 30 years, Stars Wars fans the world over have been inspired to make their own lightsaber sound effects, but now, the Force Action Lightsaber does it for you. The toy creates the distinctive power-activated \"humming\" drone that creates anticipation in moments between swings. This lightsaber also replicates the burst of electricity as the saber turns on and the blade extends as well as the \"wave\" of the blade as it hovers through the air.<P>  <b>Using the Force</b><br> Unlike the lightsabers of the Star Wars movie, the toy doesn't retract with the push of a button. After turning the weapon off, the blade can be collapsed by hand -- but be careful not to jam the blade too tightly into the handle. A couple of times while playing with the lightsaber, the blade did not extend when the power was activated; the sound effects started up, but the \"on\" button had to be pressed more than once to get the blade out. The on/off button looks as if it should also control the volume of the lightsaber -- but it does not. Parents who get sick of the \"humming\" can remove the batteries, as the lightsaber requires three AA batteries (not included) for its lights and sounds. But Obi-Wan Kenobi's Lightsaber wouldn't be half the fun without its glowing arc-wave energy blade, and the blue light is especially mesmerizing in the dark. While it's always exciting to fight against villains, the lightsaber is a great toy for young Jedis learning to wield the Force on their own.<P>  <br clear=\"all\">\"\tCOL description VAL \"Mega Bloks Harmony SmurfDeep in the forest very far from here lies a magical village full of mushroom-shaped houses and our tiny blue friends that stand three apples high The Smurfs!

Players can see the square marked 100, but how will they get there? If a player lands their pawn on a good deed, they can shimmy up a ladder, but land on the wrong spot and they'll shoot down a chute! No reading is required to play this simple and easy game for preschoolers. Players spin the spinner to see how many spots they'll move. Will their new spot send them down or move them up, up, up? Slip, slide and see who will win the Chutes and Ladders board game. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro. Be the first to move your child-shaped playing piece from square one to square 100 on the Chutes and Ladders game board--but watch out! If you land on the square that shows you ate too much candy--Ouch!--you get a tummy ache and slide down a chute to a square a few numbers below. But if you end your turn on a good-deed square, such as helping sweep up a mess, you'll be rewarded by a ladder-climb up the board. A fantastic follow-up to <a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000DMF5/${0}\">Candy Land</a>, Chutes and Ladders is ideal for younger children who are still learning to take turns and just beginning to recognize numbers (the spinner stays in the single digits). It's also a gentle introduction to the higher numbers as players climb to 100 at the top of the board. And, thanks to all those chutes and ladders, it's got enough excitement to keep your 7-year-old on the edge of her seat. English and Spanish instructions are included; no reading is necessary to play. Chutes and Ladders is for two to four players. <i>--Julie Ubben</i>\"\t1", "label": 1}

The custom-made BAG-it is a plastic retainer that's been precision cut for a perfect fit inside the standard LitterMaid receptacle (see the sample black BAG-it retainer in the photo - actual BAG-it is clear). How it works: Start with any bag that's wide enough (like the black plastic bag shown in the photo). Slip the bottom half of the bag into the inside of the BAG-it and wrap the top half of the bag around the outside of the BAG-it. Then push the bag with the BAG-it into the top of the receptacle - that's it!! The plastic bag is secured inside the receptacle and all the waste ends up IN THE BAG!! You can see videos of BAG-it and PERMA-lid on YouTube. When it comes time to remove the waste, grab the corner of the plastic bag and lift. As the bag and the BAG-it come out, tie up the ends of the bag and insert a new bag into the BAG-it. It takes less than a minute and costs you nothing if you keep some grocery bags around.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"The gym size E35 features a fluid natural motion provided by a whisper quiet drive system that functions in both forward and reverse motion.

The machine&#x2019;s cleaner head has an active base place, which self-adjusts automatically for optimal contact with all floor types. On hard floors the base plate lowers to create an efficient seal, and the brush bar lifts clear off the floor to protect delicate surfaces. On carpet, the base plate rises and the brush bar lowers for optimum bristle penetration- removing ground-in dirt and pet hair from different depths of carpet pile. And because the cleaner head adjusts automatically, there are no fiddly dials and you don&#x2019;t need to bend down to make adjustments. <br><br> Dyson cyclones capture more dirt than any other cyclone. DC40 Multi floor has Radial Root Cyclone technology with remodeled airflows to maximize suction power. DC40 Multi floor also has patented Ball technology. It turns on the spot, which allows you to maneuver more easily around obstacles and into awkward spaces. And because the motor and other key components are located inside the ball, the machine has a lower center of gravity- making it even easier to steer.   <br><br>  <h4>Patented Dyson Technology</h4> <b>New Radial Root Cyclone Technology</b> Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. As you use them, the tiny holes in the bag clog up with particles of dust. This restricts the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don&#x2019;t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the bin. No bag. No loss of suction. <br>  Dyson has been continually refining cyclone technology since inventing it more than 20 years ago. DC40 Multi floor has new Radial Root Cyclone technology. Reconfigured air channels and improved flow efficiency reduce turbulence and preserve air pressure, so that the inner cyclones can extract more microscopic particles. These refinements help remove more dirt, dust, allergens and pet hair for the airflow. <br>  <br><b>Ball Technology to Help You Steer with Ease</b> Dyson Ball upright vacuum cleaners use patented Ball technology to overcome the steering limitations of fixed wheels. They ride on a ball, which turns on the spot so you can steer with ease, changing direction with just a turn of the wrist. <br><br>  The ball itself is made of glass-reinforced polypropylene- the same material used in the manufacture of car dashboards. It combines high impact strength with the resistance to distortion. The ball also holds the heaviest component, (the motor), positioned towards the base for a lower center of gravity and greater stability. <br><br>   <h4>Features</h4> <b>Self-adjusting cleaner head: </b> DC40 Multi floor has an active base plate. It creates the optimal cleaner head contact for every floor type, reducing air leaks and retaining suction power on all floor types- wood, carpet, vinyl and tile. <br><br> <b>Instant release wand: </b>DC40 Multi floor has an instant release, long reach wand for cleaning stairs and awkward areas- it stretches up to 5 times in length. There are no separate parts to assemble. <br><br> <b>Extra tools: </b>DC40 Multi floor comes with a Combination tool and a Stair tool. The Combination tool has a debris nozzle that converts to a brush tool for dusting. The Stair tool removes dirt and dust from corners and against vertical edges of stairs. <br><br> <b>Approved for allergy sufferers: </b>All new Dyson upright and canister vacuums are certified asthma & allergy friendly by the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America. Dyson cyclones capture microscopic particles down to 0.5 microns in size, including pollen, mold and bacteria. <br><br> <b>No extra costs: </b> DC40 Multi floor comes with a 5 year warranty - parts and labor guaranteed by Dyson. <br><br> </div>       <div class=\"half-col last\"> <div class=\"half-col\">   <div class=\"leftImage\"><img style=\"max-width:95%; border:3px solid black;\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dyson/InstantWand-Use._SL500_.jpg\" alt=\"Wand\"/><div class=\"imageCaption\">The included instant release wand stretches up to 5 times in length</div></div><br><br>  <div class=\"leftImage\"><img style=\"max-width:95%; border:3px solid black\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dyson/Clear-Bin-use._SL500_.jpg\" alt=\"Clear Bin\"><div class=\"imageCaption\">A clear bin lets you see just how much you have picked up</div></div>   <tr> <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"> <table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border:1px solid #666565\" width=\"250\"> <tbody> <tr bgcolor=\"#000000\"> <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;font-weight:bold;color:#ffffff\"> What's In The Box?</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor=\"#bcbec0\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">DC40 Upright Multi Floor Vacuum</td> </tr> <tr bgcolor=\"#a7a9ac\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Extension Wand </td> </tr> <tr bgcolor=\"#bcbec0\">  <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Operating Manual</td> </tr> <tr bgcolor=\"#a7a9ac\">  <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Quickstart Guide</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor=\"#bcbec0\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Stair Tool</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor=\"#a7a9ac\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Combination Accessory Tool </td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor=\"#bcbec0\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">Product Registration Card</td> </tr>  <tr bgcolor=\"#a7a9ac\"> <td style=\"font-size:12px\"></td> <td style=\"font-size:12px\">5-Year Warranty</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  </div>    <div class=\"half-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\"><div class=\"centerImage\"><img style=\"max-width:95%; border:3px solid black;\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dyson/Cyclone_dc40-Use._SL500_.jpg\" width=\"280\" height = \"340\" alt=\"Radial Root\"><div class=\"imageCaption\">Dyson Radial Root Cyclone Technology - No bag.

As with cookware from earlier eras, this roaster is constructed of heavy and sturdy cast aluminum, which is a marvelous conductor of heat for fast and even cooking. The exterior is brushed and has an elegant silvery finish that makes it spectacular for serving as well as cooking. The interior is coated with Eclipse, a premium, long-lasting nonstick surface that makes the usual baked-on fat and grease from roasting meats much easier to clean. With the cover off, this heirloom-quality pan roasts a small ham or veal loin for a Sunday dinner. However, the roaster also has deep, 4-inch sides and a dome-shaped cover (also with an interior coating of nonstick), making it ideal for braising meat dishes, such as short ribs with noodles, steaming fish fillets, or poaching salmon. The domed cover plays a large role in the success of these moist-heat cooking methods as it keeps moisture from escaping and encourages self-basting of meats. Additionally, the roaster is completely safe for using on the range top on low to medium heat so meats can be browned and roasted in one pan. Two amply sized 1-1/4-inch tab handles on either side of the roaster are oven-safe and ensure a secure hold on this substantially weighted piece when lifting it out of the oven or bringing it to the table. The riveted stainless-steel handle on the top of the lid conveniently stays cool under high heats. This roaster comes with an anodized aluminum meat rack (which is really more like a trivet) that lifts roasts just a tad above the bottom of the cookware. To enjoy extended use with this roaster, the manufacturer recommends washing it by hand in warm soapy water and discourages the use of metal utensils, knives, or abrasive sponges that could damage the nonstick coating. The limited warranty on this product is offered by Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry for a period of 50 years. <I>--Cristina Vaamonde</I>\"\t1", "label": 1}

Cut out the image with the sticker on top - carefully cutting along the edge of the sticker, making sure not to cut the sticker itself.

Center the image/sticker glue side down onto the non-letter side of the Scrabble tile (check the orientation of the letter on the back to make sure it's facing the right direction).

Start enjoying your back yard and BBQ's again without getting chewed up by these pesky critters. How does Shoo-fly work? The use of light refraction. Light refraction happens when a clear object, such as a bag of clear liquid, alters the course and or the velocity of light. The beams of light, which normally travel in a straight line, bend due to the liquid. This effect can be responsible for a number of optical illusions that effect humans, such as mirages. In practice, applying refraction can be just as confusing to insects, especially flying ones. Most flying insects have a highly sensitive array of eyes which allow them to see in multiple directions at once.

You can use the protein in eggs for structure, and the fat in the yolks for a nice fatty mouthfeel. Sugar can also be used for structure and sweetness, but if you use powdered sugar, expect flatter thin chewy cookies. If you go with brown sugar, you may need to balance the added acidity with baking soda. And salt. Never ever forget the salt. Even in a sweet sugar cookie, forgetting salt leads to a bland cookie.

If you have trouble maintaining calcium or buffer level, check to see that the salt mix you are using has seawater level of magnesium.

The infamous German industrial designers, Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs were the masterminds behind the project; and, with their \"Less, is more\" design philosophy they produced a number of memorable products for Braun including some of the best travel alarm clocks around. Over the last 40 years, Braun time pieces were characterized by their pure, highly functional and timeless design with no superfluous details: Every feature directly reflects a function. Rooted in over half a century of modern design at Braun, the core values of functionality, quality and aesthetics are reflected in all clocks and watches. The strength of clarity and simplicity of their design makes them a pleasure to use and to own. The analogue clocks were manufactured with the intention to prioritize innovation and durability. The beautifully sleek structure and dial illumination, together with the slight graying back of the numbers ensures that the hour arms are clear and easily readable. All the clocks use precision German movements, known for their silent nature and high accuracy. A variety of models use radio controlled movements for complete accuracy of time. A selection of the very best classic clocks and watches have been recreated in keeping with the high standards of quality of the originals.

Each Solaire grill has a \"rocket under the hood\" - the Solaire Infrared Burner. This superior burner gives you the high heat to lock in the juices for more tasty, flavorful food than you can ever get from a conventional barbecue grill. Professional chefs demand high heat to create great taste - and now you can too with a Solaire Infrared. This grill is factory installed onto a stainless steel cart with casters, folding side shelves and double doors. The grill is factory assembled for use with propane and includes the regulator with 3-foot hose to connect to a propane tank. The propane tank (not included) is located inside the cart. It also includes the proper orifices and convertible regulator needed to convert to natural gas. The Grill Head includes two main infrared burners, each delivering 27,500 BTU/hr, metal knobs, and battery powered (9-volt) push-button electronic ignition. It also includes a 14,000 BTU/hour rear infrared rotisserie burner, heavy duty motor, spit rod, pair of forks and counter-weight. Stainless steel wire warming rack is 26 1/2 wide x 7 1/2 inches deep. The weight-balanced double-skinned hood includes a mirror polish accent, and has a stay-cool rotating stainless steel handle with knurled grip. The firebox is fully welded at the seams which are then ground and polished by hand. No mechanical fasteners are used. A full length cover is included for you to protect your investment when it is not in use. Solaire is a grilling machine that gives you the great flavor of an intensely hot charcoal fire with the control, convenience and consistency of gas. Become the undisputed wizard of backyard grilling, the envy of your neighborhood, and the hero of your family when you serve them juicier, more flavorful food then they've ever tasted from an ordinary grill. Solaire Infrared Grills preheat in only 3 minutes, and cook about twice as fast conventional grills. You'll be eating before your neighbor's coals are ready. With the time saved, you can now make grilling an everyday occurrence rather than just a weekend event, perfect for today's busy lifestyle. Since infrared heats the food directly, not the air around it, you will be grilling year-round, even in frigid weather, with the same grilling performance as in summertime. With excellent burner turn down, warming rack and a variety of accessories, a Solaire Grill is a very flexible heat management system that gives you the versatility to prepare virtually any type of food. Steaks, pork, fish, burgers, vegetables, chicken, fruit, shellfish - these and more benefit from the initial high heat sear delivered by the Solaire Infrared burner. Finishing the food after searing can be accomplished by turning down the burner to a lower setting, or moving it over a convection burner, if equipped. The V-shape grilling grids capture drippings and reduce flareups. The high heat of the infrared burner vaporizes drippings back into the food as smoke and flavor. Burner maintenance is easy. After you are done cooking, turn the burners on HIGH for five minutes to keep the 9,000 BTU burner ports in each burner clear of any food debris. Solaire burners can be removed without tools in seconds for thorough cleaning, service or to change from one type of burner to another (infrared to convection, and vice-versa). All Solaire grills are designed as built-in grills that can be placed onto carts. So, if you buy a cart model now, the same grill can be used in a built-in island later by merely removing a few bolts. Conversely, a built-in model can be turned into a cart model. This flexibility provides you with long-lasting value. This grill is relatively simple by design, without nonessential features that are prone to failure. The grill is covered by a limited lifetime warranty against defects in materials and workmanship for the stainless steel construction, main burners and grilling grids. The electronic ignition system has a two year parts warranty; all other components are covered for one year. All Solaire Grills are made in the USA by Rasmussen Gas Logs &amp; Grills, a fourth-generation, 102-year-old family business.\"\t0", "label": 0}

Secretary of the Navy W. Graham Claytor, Jr. gave the name Hornet on March 1, 1977. The F/A-18 is a twin-engine, multi-mission fighter/attack aircraft that can operate from either aircraft carriers or land bases. It was designed to attack both ground and aerial targets. Developed in the 1970s for service with the Navy and the US Marine Corps, it is also used by the air forces of several other nations. The Hornet fills a vast spectrum of roles, including fleet air defense, interdiction, air superiority, suppression of enemy air defenses, close and deep air support, reconnaissance, forward air control, fighter escort, and day and night strike missions. In addition, it is the aerial demonstration aircraft of the USN's Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels. Formed in 1946, the Blue Angels are the world's first officially sanctioned military aerial demonstration team. The group has been using the Hornet since they completed their 40th anniversary year and unveiled the sleek aircraft on November 8, 1986. The power and aerodynamics of the Hornet allows them to perform a slow high angle of attack tail sitting maneuver, and to fly a loop with landing gear down in formation, neither of which has been duplicated by the Thunderbirds of the Air Force. The Blue Angels perform more than 70 shows at 34 locations throughout the United States each year, where they still employ many of the same practices and techniques in their aerial displays as in 1946. Since their inception, they have flown for more than 427 million spectators worldwide.

Imagine your home a stately English mansion as you and your guests enjoy hours of suspense and intrigue. All you need is a sense of humor and a willingness to take a light-hearted attitude toward blackmail, sex, larceny, deceit and murder. Solve the murder - and prove yourself innocent of the crime. How to Host a Murder is so much fun, it's almost criminal! Vincent Price calls it \"My favorite game!\" Bring the game to life with costumes, props, and theatrical flair for a party everyones dying to attend! Those who just can't put down a good murder mystery novel are perfect candidates for this game. Eight people live out the best crime novel, and each better hope that their spouse or colleague isn't the killer. This episode, from the very popular game series that's been around for almost 15 years, is played out in an English country manor. All that's required is a host and a group of guests with imagination and a sense of ghastly fun. The game is very thoroughly planned out--from the cassette tape describing the details of the murder to the guest invitations and player manuals. For first-time players, the rules are quite specific, which will be helpful. Break one and the suspense is over!

Overall Product Weight: -2 Pounds. The Class of '54 installment of How to Host a Murder includes all the necessary items for planning and hosting a four-hour mystery dinner party for eight people. It is probably the easiest in the series for the aspiring murder-party host, but not because the mystery is easy to solve. Rather, it's because take-out burgers and fries would only enhance the game, and most of the players will have no problem putting together a costume (OK, a poodle skirt could be a bit tricky to find--but it isn't required). Nevertheless, the designers of the game's Host Guide have put together a more challenging (and more tasty) menu of brandied pot roast for ambitious hosts, and the cassette tape, featuring a malt shop atmosphere and Sargent Joe Flighty's tough-cop narrative, goes a long way toward setting the mood. After listening to the taped introduction, each of the eight players must scour the player books to find out who his or her character will be--from Joe Dierdre C. Deucer to Joseph K. Awledge. All are graduates of Roley City High's class of '54, but only one is the killer of rock star Rock N. Roley. Who will solve the murder? In addition to the Host Guide, eight player's books, and the tape, the package contains a map of the crime scene, secret clues, guest invitations, and nametags. <I>--Patrick O'Kelley</I>\"\t1", "label": 1}

Sharpens the entire edge of kitchen, fishing, hunting and pocket-knives. Safe for quality knives. Acclaimed worldwide by serious cooks and renowned chefs. Two year limited warranty. UL/ETL and Canadian Approval. Assembled in the U.S.A. It may seem like a contradiction, but sharp knives are the safest. With a clean edge, a knife is more predicable and easier to control. If you've purchased a top-of-the-line knife, maintaining the quality of the blade ensures maximum value from your investment. This Chef's Choice knife sharpener performs professional-quality sharpening on any knife, from gourmet knives to hunting knives--even the tips of serrated knives can be improved with this machine (for a complete sharpening of serrated knives, however, Chef's Choice recommends models 120 and 320). For top-quality edges, there are two sharpening and honing stages, which use 100% diamond abrasives, and a final polishing stage. Each stage uses precision angle guides to create a unique \"Trizor-Plus\" edge for maximum sharpness and durability, while a magnetic pad collects residue so the machine is easy to clean and maintain. While a sharp knife is indeed a safe knife, it's wise to use caution with your newly sharpened knives, as they'll be sharper than you expect. <I>--Laura Cuthbert</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"This professional electric 2-Stage knife sharpener sharpens both straight edge and serrated knives to better than factory edges, in just minutes. When your favorite knives start squishing ripe tomatoes instead of slicing them, it's time to sharpen your blades. This knife sharpener is remarkably easy to use on both straight-edge and serrated knives. Simply plug it in, turn it on, and feed knife blades through the stages. The first sharpening stage uses 100 percent diamond abrasive disks to hone the knife's edge while the second stage incorporates polymer disks to polish and strop the edge to hairsplitting sharpness. Straight-edge knives should go through both stages, while serrated blades should only be used in the polishing stage. The internal elastomeric spring guides hold knife blades at just the right angle to the sharpening surfaces, making sharpening easy. The instructions are easy to follow, and maintenance is limited to removing the metal dust shavings from the clean-out tray once a year or so; no lubrication is necessary for the motor, bearings, or sharpening surfaces. Guaranteed not to detemper, the sharpener has a two-year warranty for home use. <i>--Ariel Meadow Stallings</i>\"\t1", "label": 1}

The company's \"belief in the unlimited possibilities of play\" and dedication to producing the best possible toys is highlighted by this huge, intricate set. <P> Redesigned to include modern bricks and details, this 1950's town center includes a gas station with a car wash, a movie theatre, and the town hall building. There are eight Lego mini-figures, classic cars, corner light fixtures, and a fountain to place in the town square. Collectors are sure to notice the inclusion of unique Lego elements and bricks in rare colors. <b>Bringing the Town to Life</b><br> With 35 bags containing 1,981 pieces and two large instruction booklets, the Town Plan set took our eight-year-old Lego tester about 12 hours to build. Like with all Lego sets, the instructions include here provide colorful step-by-step images that make it fairly easy for any diligent builder to create the detailed town buildings and vehicles. We did have about 20 left-over pieces at the end of construction, which puzzled our tester. While it may seem like this mature set is designed to appeal to adults, our young tester immediately found lots of different ways to have fun with it. The cinema got a big thumbs up for having cool, realistic details like popcorn at the concession stand and a movie on the screen. The moving garage door and the scrubbers in the car wash were big hits, too. <P> The rooms inside Town Hall are a little small, which limits Lego figures who want to move around. This pushed lots of play out into the open area around the fountain. The three gold bricks in the fountain add a unique touch to this particular set. The one minor complaint that surfaced in our testing was that the flowers and vegetation \"planted\" around the Town Hall failed to stay securely attached when moving pieces around. Overall, this is an expansive town set that promises lots of creative construction projects. With so many people and buildings, and more than one vehicle, this Town is a great pick for a single creative builder or cooperative play with friends and siblings. Additionally, with its unique 1950's vibe, this town is set to inspire fun, interactive play between parents or grandparents and kids. Odds are, you'll even find yourself driving the vintage car through the wash after your children have gone to bed--it's that cool. <b>What's in the Box</b><br> 1,981 Lego pieces and two instruction booklets. <br clear=\"all\">\"\t0", "label": 0}

This means that there are small holes in the fabric allowing a certain amount of hot air to escape. In extreme heat, this can be an important benefit. However, there is a cost. The harmful UV light also comes through holes. Because of the holes, knitted shade sails rarely give more than 90% UV protection. Although 90% sounds quite impressive, it means that 10% of the dangerous light gets through. If your child sits under a knitted sail shade for 10 hours, it would be the same as sitting under the direct sun, completely unprotected, for a whole hour. Kookaburra sail shades are woven, not knitted. This means they have the maximum possible UV protection from a fabric. It also means they are waterproof - ideal for unpredictable weather. Kookaburra shade sails are independently tested to UPF50+, more than 98% - the maximum UV protection.\"\t0", "label": 0}

Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 5-inch blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a wide point. The serrated edge is perfect for cutting and slicing soft products that have a firm skin, as this type of blade penetrates more easily than one with a smooth edge. This medium-size knife makes a handy and versatile kitchen tool for cooks of any ilk. Most of the Henckels lines--including the popular Four Star series--feature blades made of Friodur, a special, ice-hardened, no-stain steel created and patented by the company in 1939. This special formula was designed for exceptional hardness and high resistance to corrosion. Founded in 1731, the J.A.

Based on the durable Panzer III chassis with a completely new superstructure, the revolving turret was eliminated and the short barreled 75mm L/24 gun was mounted directly onto the hull, giving the StuG III an extremely low vehicle profile. Originally intended for close infantry fire support, it was used as self-propelled artillery against enemy strong points. However, when the German forces encountered the Russian KV-I and T-34 tanks on the Eastern front, the situation abruptly changed. To cope with this Russian tank threat, the Germans were forced to upgrade their existing weapons systems. The resulting StuG III Ausf.G, built from late 1942 onwards, used a more powerful, long barreled 75mm L/48 gun.About the ModelAssembly model of the Sturmgeschutz III Ausf.G Early Version on a compact 1/48 scale.Realistically replicated gun and square-shaped welded type mantlet.Kit allows choice of either 75mm L/48 gun or 105mm howitzer.Die-cast lower hull for extra weight and enhanced realismKit includes 1 commander figure (torso).Choice of 3 sets of markings.\"\t0", "label": 0}

With the Sauron expansion, the fellowship of Hobbits are no longer competing solely against the game and its boards. In Sauron one player takes on the role of the dark lord and seeks to thwart the fellowship's crucial mission. Okay look, we've all seen the movies, many of us have read the books, and plenty of us have already played the incredibly cool <I>Lord of the Rings</I> board game designed by Reiner Knizia. And while the determined pluck of the hobbits is obviously worthy of admiration, haven't you ever thought there was something kind of cool about Sauron? Sure you might not want to admit it, or maybe you do, but the guy is in at least a partially sympathetic spot. He just wants to rule all of creation and to do that, all he needs to do is pry some jewelry away from a hobbit. With this Sauron expansion set to the original board game, players can get their chance to play the bad guy himself, employ the Black Rider, and rule them all. But beware: with this set, the pesky hobbits have some new weapons of their own. The set includes 30 Sauron cards, nine Nazgul cards, and five Fellowship cards. It's not capable of being played on its own but makes a great counterpart, and counterpoint, to the original board game. <I>--Charlie Williams</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"Every detail is authentic, richly realistic and true to the Academy Award winning epic film.

Honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans, this celebrated collection is the model of safety, ergonomics, and comfort. Thanks to their seamless transition from bolster to handle, the knives are comfortable to use for long periods of time. The bolster provides the right balance while acting as a safe finger guard. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with ZWILLING's signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR blades are harder, sharper, they will NOT STAIN or chip and they retain their sharpness longer. Precision-forged from a single piece of steel, the SIGMAFORGE knives have an exceptionally sturdy, balanced and flexible blade. The 10-inch fine-edged blade on this knife features slightly curved surfaces on both the back and the cutting edge, terminating in a sharp point. The hand-honed blade is slim and narrow to facilitate even, precise meat cutting. It is made with Henckels' Sintermetal Component Technology (SCT), which allows three different grades of steel to be combined to form a single piece, fusing together the blade, bolster, and tang. What does this mean in layman's terms? It means a strong, high-quality knife that will last a lifetime. Founded in 1731, the J.A.

Where other companies look to hired help for their \"knowledge\", standing on the shoulders of giants, Lynn and his team invested their own blood, sweat and tears, endlessly sparring with different prototypes looking for ways to improve upon this already near perfect design. Lynn recognized that many of the qualities that make a great fighting knife also make a great bushcraft tool. A sharp blade, strong tip, good hand protection and a versatile handle are all key. Stripping the Kukri back to its bare basics he then began re-designing the knife from the ground up. The re-imagined blade was presented at an entirely new angle, keeping the cutting power that made the Kukri the stuff of legend, but increasing its thrusting and piercing power. The handle with its integral guard kept the user's precious digits safe from harm while changing the balance and heft of the knife considerably. The newly christened Royal Kukri was then extensively field-tested. Proving to be an outstanding multi-functional bush knife.

Water:</b><br/> Coffee is 98% water. Often overlooked, the quality of the water is as important as the quality of the coffee. A good rule of thumb is that if your water doesn&rsquo;t taste good from the tap, it won&rsquo;t taste any better in your coffee. That&rsquo;s why Cuisinart has added a water filter to the 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker. The charcoal water filter removes chlorine, bad tastes and odors, for the purest cup of coffee every time. <b>Element 2. Coffee:</b><br/> While the bulk of the liquid is water, all of the flavor should be from the coffee. To achieve the same great quality of coffee you receive at a coffee bar, you need to use the same quality beans. Buy the beans fresh and whole, only about a two weeks&rsquo; supply at a time for maximum freshness. Once the coffee bean is broken, its flavor degrades very quickly. If it is not practical to buy small supplies, we recommend you separate larger amounts of beans into one to two week portions immediately after purchase, and freeze them in airtight containers. The best way to maximize freshness is to minimize exposure to air, light and moisture. So, once removed from the freezer, beans should be maintained in a sealed container at room temperature, since damaging condensation occurs every time the beans are removed from the freezer or refrigerator. Note that some coffee experts advise against freezing dark-roast beans, because freezing can cause the oils to coagulate. Other experts disagree. We suggest you experiment and decide yourself. <b>Element 3. Grind: </b><br/> The grind of the coffee is critical for proper flavor extraction. If the grind is too fine, over extraction and bitterness will result. Too fine a grind may also clog the filter. If the grind is too coarse, the water will pass through too quickly and the desired flavors will not be extracted. A medium-fine grind is recommended. <b>Element 4. Proportion:</b><br/> Coffee that is too strong or too weak is always a disappointment. Add 1 level scoop of ground coffee per cup and adjust the amount according to taste. Note: the maximum capacity for ground coffee is 17 tablespoons for the 12-cup coffeemaker. Exceeding this amount may cause overflow if the coffee is too finely ground.\"\t0", "label": 0}

Hitachi 326241 EBM1830 18-Volt Lithium-Ion 3.0 Ah HXP Battery The Hitachi EBM1830 18-Volt Lithium-Ion 3.0 Ah HXP Battery features the revolutionary Hitachi HXP Lithium-Ion technology. This advanced technology delivers a battery that is 50-percent lighter than an average NiCd battery, with a longer overall battery life and a longer run time than any other technology on the market. The HXP battery features a specialized internal circuitry system that is equipped with a current interruption and detection system, thermal protector, and an electronic switch to protect the battery against overcharge and discharge. Hitachi built this battery to be backwards compatible (it works with the DMR and DVF3 series of 18-volt cordless tools), and since the HXP battery is built on the 18-volt platform -- the core of the cordless market -- it prevents users from buying a whole new voltage platform. <table align=left width=250 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/battery-large.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/battery-med.jpg\" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>Hitachi's 18-volt battery weights over 50% lighter than an average NiCd battery. <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail- page/battery-large.jpg\">View larger</a>.</b></i> <small></td></tr></table> <table align=right width=150 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/combo-universal.jpg\" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>Universal charger charges 7.2 volt to 18 volt Hitachi Lithium-Ion batteries as well as NiCd and NiMH batteries of same voltage.</a></b></i></small></td></tr> <tr> <td> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/battery-protection.jpg\" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>Circuit technology featured in the battery and universal charger prevents the battery from losing full power when in use, and overheating when charging.</b></i></small></td></tr> <tr> <td> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/th/detail-page/battery-storage.jpg\" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>HXP batteries have a low power discharge while in storage.</b></i></small></td></tr> </table> The EBM1830 provides a steady level of power during the entire usage, ensuring the battery's full potential every time. This battery has a recharge life of approximately 1300 to 1500 times, as opposed to an average of 500 times for NiCd or NiMH batteries. It has a low power discharge while in storage so you can rest assured that your tools will always be ready when you are. Not only does the HXP battery deliver a longer life and extended power, it is also surprising lightweight. When you're using a tool powered by HXP technology, it feels like you're holding a 12-volt tool while experiencing the power of 18 volts. This reduces user fatigue and improves manageability without sacrificing power. This battery is recharged with the <a href=\"/Hitachi-UC18YRL-Universal-Lithium-Ion- Batteries/dp/B000K8AS9K\">Hitachi UC18YRL Universal Battery Charger</a> and is designed to power a variety of tools, such as the <a href=\"/Hitachi-WR18DL-18-Volt-Lithium- Cordless/dp/B000JESSTW\">Hitachi WR18DL Cordless Impact Wrench</a>, the <a href=\"/Hitachi- WR18DL-18-Volt-Lithium-Cordless/dp/B000JESSTW\">Hitachi WH18DL Cordless Impact Driver</a>, and other compatible Hitachi tools. It is important to fully charge your battery before attempting to use it in your power tools. To charge your EBM1830 battery properly, position the battery so that the nameplate faces towards the nameplate of the charger and press the battery into place until comes into full contact with the bottom of plate. Inserting the battery turns the charger on, and the pilot lamp should light up. If the pilot lamp does not light up, pull out the power cord from the base and check the battery mounting condition. Once your battery is fully charged, the pilot lamp will slowly blink red and you're battery will be ready to use. In general, the <a href=\"/Hitachi-UC18YRL-Universal-Lithium-Ion- Batteries/dp/B000K8AS9K\">UC18YRL</a> should charge your battery in approximately 45 minutes. Although the variation is minor, ambient temperature above or below room temperature may effect recharging time. <b>Recharging New Batteries: What to Expect</b><br> The internal chemical substance of your new batteries is not activated, thus the electric discharge might be low when using them the first or second time. This is a temporary phenomenon and is not cause for alarm. The normal time required for recharging will be restored by recharging the battery 2-3 times. <b>How to Make Your Battery Perform Longer</b><br> The best way to maximize the life of your battery, is to follow two easy steps. First of all, remember to recharge your battery before it becomes completely exhausted. When you feel that the power of the tool becomes weaker, stop using the tool and recharge the battery. If you continue to use the tool and exhaust the electric current, the battery may be damaged and its life will become shorter. Secondly, you should always avoid recharging your batteries at high temperatures. A rechargeable battery will be hot immediately after use. If a battery is recharged while it's still hot, its internal chemical substance will deteriorate, and the battery life will be shortened. <b>About Hitachi Power Tools</b><br> Hitachi Power Tools carries an extensive line of professional grade tools and accessories for woodworking, metalworking, concrete drilling and cutting, as well as a complete line of pneumatic nailers, staplers, compressors and collated fasteners.

One features a crescent-moon cutout along its length that fully embraces the other, which has a perfectly round top and bottom. Both of the shakers stand six inches tall, are quite heavy, and are utterly compelling both individually and as a snug-together unit. The crescent top features three holes, the round top just one (black and white plastic plugs underneath may be used to specify pepper or salt). The Hug set is a creation of one of Namb's most prolific and award-winning designers, Karim Rashid. The metal shakers will not chip or crack, and will maintain their mirror finish as long as they are washed by hand, never in a dishwasher. Namb was founded in 1951 in a village of the same name in scenic northern New Mexico. From the beginning, the company focused on hand-producing high-quality, functional items such as metal bowls and trays with great attention to timeless, modern design. Still made in the USA, Namb's signature metal alloy is liquified, poured into a hand-made sand cast, and the resulting piece repeatedly polished and smoothed by hand. Exceptional gifts for the most special of occasions, Namb metal bowls and accessories are now joined by porcelain and crystal pieces, each flawlessly crafted. Namb ware has won numerous design awards, has been shown in or recognized by nearly two dozen museums worldwide, and is part of the permanent collections of many prestigious institutions. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>\"\t0", "label": 0}

Classic series knives were the first to feature Wusthof PEtec - Precision Edge Technology - for an easily maintained razor-sharp edge that retains its cutting performance twice as long as other knives. The attractive, ergonomic black handle is designed for comfort and control, and is made of a seamless, synthetic material for a hygienic grip. The handle is triple-riveted to the full-length tang for exceptional durability and the full bolster protects fingers from slipping. Cook's knives are indispensable kitchen helpers. They perform a wide variety of cutting chores, from mincing to dicing and slicing. The 5-inch blade of this definitive example provides sufficient heft to allow the knife rather than the cook to do most of the cutting labor; it's modest blade length makes it particularly useful for small chopping jobs, slicing, and cubing. Many people favor a cook's knife of this size because it combines the maneuverability of a paring knife with the strength and weight of a larger cook's knife. Part of the Classic series, the knife represents two centuries of unexcelled W&uuml;sthof craftsmanship. Like other cutlery in the series, it's hand-forged from a single piece of stainless steel for maximum strength; the hand-polished blade is exactingly calibrated to be hard enough to resist dulling yet soft enough to take a keen edge when it's honed or sharpened. Dishwasher-safe and with a traditionally shaped, ergonomically designed handle that is triple-riveted for durability, this knife brings a guaranteed lifetime of low-maintenance cutting to any cook who owns it. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>\"\tCOL description VAL \"4582-7/14  Features: -Blade Dimension 5''.-Forged From One Piece Of Specially Tempered High Carbon Steel To Ensure Outstanding Strength.-Extraordinary Sharpness Which Is Easy To Maintain.-Special Alloyed Steel.-Seamless, Hygienic Fit Of Handle.-Triple-Riveted, Full Tang Synthetic Handle.-Dishwasher Safe, But Hand-Washing Recommended.-Lifetime Guarantee.-Made in Solingen, Germany.\"\t1", "label": 1}

It will maintain a sharp edge with daily use. Despite the name, sharpening steels don't actually sharpen  knives--unless they're diamond steels. Instead, they perform the vital  task of realigning, or resetting, edges, which bend when contacting a  cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool is made of  harder-than-steel ceramic it performs better and quicker than most  steels. Using the sharpener often--before each time a knife is employed  is ideal--prevents a blade from becoming dull and prolongs intervals  between professional sharpenings, or the need of a whetstone or other  true sharpening device. Like Global's signature knife handles, the  ceramic sharpener's handle is molded for comfort and dimpled for a safe  grip. The rule is that a realigning tool should be at least as long as  the knife blade being drawn across it, and this sharpener's 9-1/2-inch  rod is long enough for most household knives. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"<ul><li>Dimensions: 4.5 IN x 20.2 IN x 14.2 IN</ul> Although steels often are touted as sharpening tools, few actually sharpen knife blades, but they do perform the vital task of realigning, or resetting, edges, which bend when contacting a cutting surface or other hard object. Because this tool's chrome/vanadium stainless-steel rod contains hundreds of thousands of diamond particles, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. Using this steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles. However, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings better than a steel without diamonds because it accomplishes the final task of a professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine point. Exceptionally well made, this tool's rod has a solid core and has been plated with hard chrome for additional resistance to abrasion and to extend its life. Because the rod is a 3/4-inch-wide oval, it exposes more surface and works quicker than a cylindrical rod. Like Global's signature knife handles, the steel's handle is molded for comfort and dimpled for a safe grip.

Oven and broiler safe. Limited 10-year warranty. Made in Germany. Lid is safe under broiler but is not for stovetop use. At 16-3/4 inches long, this 11-quart oval pan is roomy enough for a 22-pound turkey or two chickens. Use it also to roast, braise, or stew meats and vegetables.

Both roasting pan and lid have offset handles to fit neatly into oven corners. Chantal's German-manufactured enamel cookware combines utility and beauty in a moderately priced package. Sandwiching a steel core that heats quickly and evenly, the enameled exteriors and interiors are chip- and stick-resistant, nonporous, and won't react with acidic foods.

The ECONOSWITCH's three modes of operation make it easy to create a customized lighting program that fits your lifestyle. The manual mode operates via a conventional on/off switch. The automatic mode turns lights on/off at sunset and sunrise, or on at sunset and off at your own programmed time--this mode also adjusts for daylight saving. You can also choose vacation mode, which randomly activates your lights to simulate a presence when you're away from home. <b>Fast Installation and Easy Programming</b><br>Thanks to clear instructions and labeled wires, the ECONOSWITCH is quick and easy to install and program. The intuitive three-button interface makes it simple to create up to seven programs per week--the programs can apply to a single day or the entire week via a single-pole three-wire (line, load, and neutral) connection (1,800-watt maximum; 3/4 horsepower at 120 volts). Additionally, for each day of the week, you can choose sunset/sunrise programming, specific on/off times, or both. And when the seasons change, you can count on your lights turning on only when outside conditions warrant--automatic daylight saving updates mean you don't have to reprogram. <b>Versatile Unit Features Backlit Display and LED</b><br>Designed for versatility, the ECONOSWITCH works with motors and all types of lighting. It's compatible with electronic ballasts, compact fluorescent lights, and tungsten lighting up to 12 Amperes. For further convenience, a large, white backlit display includes a night light mode for easy reading in dark areas. There's also a confirmation LED for at-a-glance load status (on or off). <b>Dimensions and Warranty Information</b><br>The ECONOSWITCH T1071 Seven-Day Solar Programmable Wall Switch measures 1.7 by 2.7 by 1.7 inches (W x H x D) and is backed by a three-year warranty. <b>About Aube: Comfort, Quality, and Savings</b><br>Since 1991 the Aube brand has symbolized quality, precision, and trust. In September 2008, it became part of Honeywell--an industry leader in energy-saving products. Today, Honeywell's Aube line includes programmable switches, thermostats, relays, electronic timers, digital thermometers, and hygrometers.

It is also considered to be good for the physical heart and for emotional balance and stability. Jade is also very helpful as a stone of abundance. Physically, jade is used to heal lung problems, kidney problems, immune system weakness, PTSD, and nervous system overwork.Jade, considered a very lucky stone, facilitates peace and harmony between the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of ones life. When all of these aspects operate in harmony and balance, goals become easier to reach. Chinese people think jade prayer beads can bless one away from tragedy. Jade can be used as a dream-enhancer by slipping a mala of it under your pillow or inside your pillow case while sleeping. Blessed and Energized with proper Mantras, Puja's and Spiritually activated by SWAMI BUDHIRAJA to give best results.

These knives are one-piece, hot-drop hammer forged from a single billet of the finest German stainless steel alloy and fitted with the most durable industrial strength, ergonomic handle in the world. Meridian Elit knives are handcrafted and polished one at a time using the same techniques that have been the hallmark of fine Solingen-made cutlery that have stood the test of time. Meridian Elit knives are the authentically superior, forged and triple-riveted knives manufactured in Solingen, Germany.Crafted from 3rd generation craftsmen in the historical cutlery city of Solingen, Germany.The Messermeister Meridian Elit 8\" Carving Knife, has a narrow spear-point, fine-edge blade that is used for small to medium carving chores. It separates meat from the bone and slices it into thin serving portions. This knife's narrow, thin blade makes any carving job a breeze. The 8-inch blade, long enough for most slicing tasks, neatly carves slices--thick or thin--from roast beef, ham, and turkey. One of Messermeister's top-of-the-line Elite knives, which are distinguished from the company's first-rate San Moritz knives by a three-step hand sharpening process blades undergo and classic three-rivet, full-tang, seamless polymer handles, the knife is forged from a single piece of high-carbon stainless steel. The blade has a shortened bolster so it's sharp from tip to heel and a cook's forefinger rests comfortably on it. Made in Germany, the knife comes in a padded gift box. To keep the blade sharp, it's best to hand wash this knife in soapy water. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"\tCOL description VAL \"The Messermeister Carving Set consists of an 10-inch Kullenschliff Slicing Knife (E/3688-10K) and a 7-inch Straight Carving Fork (8012-7).\"\t1", "label": 1}

John Renaker set up the first kiln by running a garden hose from the family's gas stove. Maxine Renaker was the first designer and salesperson. After successfully selling their first pieces, they found they could not produce them. John Renaker's Mom, Moss Renaker, worked for a pottery in Monrovia called Walker Potteries. Her boss, Joe Walker, agreed to teach John about the pottery business. Maxine's Dad, Ole Hagen, agreed to build the young couple their first factory. Ole who was a carpenter by trade, went to Oregon to get a load of lumber at wholesale cost, and he and his brother, Arne worked every weekend for months to build a combination factory and apartment. In gratitude, John and Maxine named their new company Hagen-Renaker. On Easter Sunday, 1946, the family and their fledgling company moved to Monrovia. The company first produced elaborately decorated plates and butter pats and shadow boxes. They were selling well, but there were difficulties with them related to firing and shipping. John Renaker noticed a small duck that Maxine had on her work bench. She was a Camp Fire Girl leader, and she had designed it for the kids. He saw potential in it and put it on the bottom of the company's order sheet. When he saw how it sold, he decided to change direction and produce small figurines. Very soon they had transformed Helen Perrin from a decorator into a designer, and she was joined by others. John and Maxine were able to recognize artistic excellence and based their business on these talented designers. This tradition and continues it today. Maureen Love Calvert and Helen Perrin Farnlund are still providing a majority of the new items to the line and have been joined by Bob McGuinness and Kathleen Ellis.

These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag: <strong><font color=CC6600>Buy for Cold</font></strong><br> It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10. Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for \"warm\" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night. <strong><font color=CC6600>Goose or No Goose?</font></strong><br> The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly <i>and</i> stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use. All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget. <strong><font color=CC6600>Bags for All Shapes</font></strong><br> Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips. <strong><font color=CC6600>Pad Yourself</font></strong><br> No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you. \"\t0", "label": 0}

Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption &#xFFFD; making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on. All items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece. Le Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. The enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip. DO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source. OVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times. BROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source. MICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed. FREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot. CLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary. This 9-1/4-inch square baker, crafted from commercial-grade  stoneware with Le Creuset's poterie glaze, cooks up a mean hot dish and  looks good doing it. Coated inside and out with the company's signature  enamel, the dish doesn't absorb moisture and resists chips, nicks,  stains, and odors. It's oven-safe to 500 degrees F and can also go in  the freezer, refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. It even looks  good at the table. The easy-grip side handles--ridged above and lipped  underneath--provide room enough for oven-mitt-sized fingers. <i>--Emily Bedard</i>\"\tCOL description VAL \"Le Creuset Square 9 inch dish with free 5 inch small square dish is perfect for a variety of recipes.\"\t1", "label": 1}

The trainer showcases a unique, patented orbital linkage system that provides you with a smooth elliptical pattern as you work out. As a result, the trainer's quiet, low-impact stride feels completely natural and is exceptionally smooth through the entire range of motion. The machine's expanded electronics package, meanwhile, includes an easy-to-use fitness computer that tracks time, speed, distance, and approximate calories burned. And thanks to the 10 preset workout programs and two heart rate control programs, you can easily define a workout pace that's comfortable yet challenging. Another handy feature is the 1100 HR/A's focus bar, which features built-in hand pulse sensors for immediate heart rate readings. This gives you a convenient way to keep track of your heart rate, helping you stay within the target zone and maximize your calorie burn.

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips. Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home. Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \"\tCOL description VAL \"Sunny Health & Fitness SF-E902 Air Walk Trainer provides an aerobic workout, giving you all the benefits of stretching, walking, running, cross-country, skiing and aerobic dancing without jarring impacts or damaging movements to your body.

Figure is based on the charactor from the episode of the Series \"When in Rome\". Highly detailed removeable cloth outfit and a great likeness of Lucy Lawless. Made by ToyBiz in 1999 and long out of production. Roman Xena from episode \"When in Rome\". After capturing the ruthless Roman warlord Crassus, Xena and Gabrielle go to Rome to strike a deal with Caesar: Crassus in exchange for freedom fighter Vercinix. Though Caesar purports to accept the trade, Xena knows full well that he will never honor his bargain. Xena realizes that she has put herself in the middle of a political struggle between Caesar and his Roman rival Pompey the Magnus. She devises a plan to free Vercinix by using Caesar's own ruthlessness and political agenda against him. In the meantime, Pompey attempts to enlist Xena's aid in assassinating Caesar, a prospect that the Warrior Princess finds intriguing, for Caesar has caused her nothing but pain and misery, even going so far as to crucify her many years ago. After a brutal round of hand-to-hand combat in the Coliseum, Xena liberates Vercinix and tricks Caesar into executing his ally, Crassus. Ever since actress Lucy Lawless hit television fame in <I>Xena, Warrior Princess</I>, she has attracted twin followings. Some youngsters appreciate her as just another superhero.

The SteelPro takes the guesswork and intimidation out of sharpening, yet still uses the preferred steel method instead of abrasives to create a super-sharp edge. By drawing a blade alternately through one slot then another in the SteelPro approximately ten times, the edge develops micro-serrations that cut food exceptionally well. The guides maintain an angle of approximately 23 degrees. Professional sharpening will still be required periodically in the life of a high-quality knife. Clever design features make this device a pleasure to use. Using a coin, the tops of the two miniature steels can be loosened and the steels rotated when a fresh surface is required. However, the steel is so hard that several thousand strokes are needed to dull it even slightly. The sure-grip handle is comfortable for either left- or right-handed users, and a ring allows the sharpener to be hung. The glossy, chrome-look base is actually a durable plastic but looks smart in the modern kitchen and stays put during use thanks to small rubber feet. Not for use with scissors, serrated knives, or ceramic knives, the SteelPro is covered by a one-year warranty and measures 7 by 2 by 2-3/4 inches. <I>--Ann Bieri</I>\"\t0", "label": 0}
